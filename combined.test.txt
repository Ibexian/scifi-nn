Mr. Bedford Meets Mr. Cavor at Lympne  As I sit down to write here amidst the shadows of vine-leaves under the blue sky of southern Italy, it comes to me with a certain quality of astonishment that my participation in these amazing adventures of Mr. Cavor was, after all, the outcome of the purest accident. It might have been any one. I fell into these things at a time when I thought myself removed from the slightest possibility of disturbing experiences. I had gone to Lympne because I had imagined it the most uneventful place in the world. "Here, at any rate," said I, "I shall find peace and a chance to work!"  And this book is the sequel. So utterly at variance is destiny with all the little plans of men. I may perhaps mention here that very recently I had come an ugly cropper in certain business enterprises. Sitting now surrounded by all the circumstances of wealth, there is a luxury in admitting my extremity. I can admit, even, that to a certain extent my disasters were conceivably of my own making. It may be there are directions in which I have some capacity, but the conduct of business operations is not among these. But in those days I was young, and my youth among other objectionable forms took that of a pride in my capacity for affairs. I am young still in years, but the things that have happened to me have rubbed something of the youth from my mind. Whether they have brought any wisdom to light below it is a more doubtful matter.  It is scarcely necessary to go into the details of the speculations that landed me at Lympne, in Kent. Nowadays even about business transactions there is a strong spice of adventure. I took risks. In these things there is invariably a certain amount of give and take, and it fell to me finally to do the giving reluctantly enough. Even when I had got out of everything, one cantankerous creditor saw fit to be malignant. Perhaps you have met that flaming sense of outraged virtue, or perhaps you have only felt it. He ran me hard. It seemed to me, at last, that there was nothing for it but to write a play, unless I wanted to drudge for my living as a clerk. I have a certain imagination, and luxurious tastes, and I meant to make a vigorous fight for it before that fate overtook me. In addition to my belief in my powers as a business man, I had always in those days had an idea that I was equal to writing a very good play. It is not, I believe, a very uncommon persuasion. I knew there is nothing a man can do outside legitimate business transactions that has such opulent possibilities, and very probably that biased my opinion. I had, indeed, got into the habit of regarding this unwritten drama as a convenient little reserve put by for a rainy day. That rainy day had come, and I set to work.  I soon discovered that writing a play was a longer business than I had supposed; at first I had reckoned ten days for it, and it was to have a pied-a-terre while it was in hand that I came to Lympne. I reckoned myself lucky in getting that little bungalow. I got it on a three years' agreement. I put in a few sticks of furniture, and while the play was in hand I did my own cooking. My cooking would have shocked Mrs. Bond. And yet, you know, it had flavour. I had a coffee-pot, a sauce-pan for eggs, and one for potatoes, and a frying-pan for sausages and bacon--such was the simple apparatus of my comfort. One cannot always be magnificent, but simplicity is always a possible alternative. For the rest I laid in an eighteen-gallon cask of beer on credit, and a trustful baker came each day. It was not, perhaps, in the style of Sybaris, but I have had worse times. I was a little sorry for the baker, who was a very decent man indeed, but even for him I hoped.  Certainly if any one wants solitude, the place is Lympne. It is in the clay part of Kent, and my bungalow stood on the edge of an old sea cliff and stared across the flats of Romney Marsh at the sea. In very wet weather the place is almost inaccessible, and I have heard that at times the postman used to traverse the more succulent portions of his route with boards upon his feet. I never saw him doing so, but I can quite imagine it. Outside the doors of the few cottages and houses that make up the present village big birch besoms are stuck, to wipe off the worst of the clay, which will give some idea of the texture of the district. I doubt if the place would be there at all, if it were not a fading memory of things gone for ever. It was the big port of England in Roman times, Portus Lemanis, and now the sea is four miles away. All down the steep hill are boulders and masses of Roman brickwork, and from it old Watling Street, still paved in places, starts like an arrow to the north. I used to stand on the hill and think of it all, the galleys and legions, the captives and officials, the women and traders, the speculators like myself, all the swarm and tumult that came clanking in and out of the harbour. And now just a few lumps of rubble on a grassy slope, and a sheep or two--and I. And where the port had been were the levels of the marsh, sweeping round in a broad curve to distant Dungeness, and dotted here and there with tree clumps and the church towers of old medical towns that are following Lemanis now towards extinction.  That outlook on the marsh was, indeed, one of the finest views I have ever seen. I suppose Dungeness was fifteen miles away; it lay like a raft on the sea, and farther westward were the hills by Hastings under the setting sun. Sometimes they hung close and clear, sometimes they were faded and low, and often the drift of the weather took them clean out of sight. And all the nearer parts of the marsh were laced and lit by ditches and canals.  The window at which I worked looked over the skyline of this crest, and it was from this window that I first set eyes on Cavor. It was just as I was struggling with my scenario, holding down my mind to the sheer hard work of it, and naturally enough he arrested my attention.  The sun had set, the sky was a vivid tranquillity of green and yellow, and against that he came out black--the oddest little figure.  He was a short, round-bodied, thin-legged little man, with a jerky quality in his motions; he had seen fit to clothe his extraordinary mind in a cricket cap, an overcoat, and cycling knickerbockers and stockings. Why he did so I do not know, for he never cycled and he never played cricket. It was a fortuitous concurrence of garments, arising I know not how. He gesticulated with his hands and arms, and jerked his head about and buzzed. He buzzed like something electric. You never heard such buzzing. And ever and again he cleared his throat with a most extraordinary noise.  There had been rain, and that spasmodic walk of his was enhanced by the extreme slipperiness of the footpath. Exactly as he came against the sun he stopped, pulled out a watch, hesitated. Then with a sort of convulsive gesture he turned and retreated with every manifestation of haste, no longer gesticulating, but going with ample strides that showed the relatively large size of his feet--they were, I remember, grotesquely exaggerated in size by adhesive clay--to the best possible advantage.  This occurred on the first day of my sojourn, when my play-writing energy was at its height and I regarded the incident simply as an annoying distraction--the waste of five minutes. I returned to my scenario. But when next evening the apparition was repeated with remarkable precision, and again the next evening, and indeed every evening when rain was not falling, concentration upon the scenario became a considerable effort. "Confound the man," I said, "one would think he was learning to be a marionette!" and for several evenings I cursed him pretty heartily. Then my annoyance gave way to amazement and curiosity. Why on earth should a man do this thing? On the fourteenth evening I could stand it no longer, and so soon as he appeared I opened the french window, crossed the verandah, and directed myself to the point where he invariably stopped.  He had his watch out as I came up to him. He had a chubby, rubicund face with reddish brown eyes--previously I had seen him only against the light. "One moment, sir," said I as he turned. He stared. "One moment," he said, "certainly. Or if you wish to speak to me for longer, and it is not asking too much--your moment is up--would it trouble you to accompany me?"  "Not in the least," said I, placing myself beside him.  "My habits are regular. My time for intercourse--limited."  "This, I presume, is your time for exercise?"  "It is. I come here to enjoy the sunset."  "You don't."  "Sir?"  "You never look at it."  "Never look at it?"  "No. I've watched you thirteen nights, and not once have you looked at the sunset--not once."  He knitted his brows like one who encounters a problem.  "Well, I enjoy the sunlight--the atmosphere--I go along this path, through that gate"--he jerked his head over his shoulder--"and round--"  "You don't. You never have been. It's all nonsense. There isn't a way. To-night for instance--"  "Oh! to-night! Let me see. Ah! I just glanced at my watch, saw that I had already been out just three minutes over the precise half-hour, decided there was not time to go round, turned--"  "You always do."  He looked at me--reflected. "Perhaps I do, now I come to think of it. But what was it you wanted to speak to me about?"  "Why, this!"  "This?"  "Yes. Why do you do it? Every night you come making a noise--"  "Making a noise?"  "Like this." I imitated his buzzing noise. He looked at me, and it was evident the buzzing awakened distaste. "Do I do that?" he asked.  "Every blessed evening."  "I had no idea."  He stopped dead. He regarded me gravely. "Can it be," he said, "that I have formed a Habit?"  "Well, it looks like it. Doesn't it?"  He pulled down his lower lip between finger and thumb. He regarded a puddle at his feet.  "My mind is much occupied," he said. "And you want to know why! Well, sir, I can assure you that not only do I not know why I do these things, but I did not even know I did them. Come to think, it is just as you say; I never _have_ been beyond that field.... And these things annoy you?"  For some reason I was beginning to relent towards him. "Not annoy," I said. "But--imagine yourself writing a play!"  "I couldn't."  "Well, anything that needs concentration."  "Ah!" he said, "of course," and meditated. His expression became so eloquent of distress, that I relented still more. After all, there is a touch of aggression in demanding of a man you don't know why he hums on a public footpath.  "You see," he said weakly, "it's a habit."  "Oh, I recognise that."  "I must stop it."  "But not if it puts you out. After all, I had no business--it's something of a liberty."  "Not at all, sir," he said, "not at all. I am greatly indebted to you. I should guard myself against these things. In future I will. Could I trouble you--once again? That noise?"  "Something like this," I said. "Zuzzoo, zuzzoo. But really, you know--"  "I am greatly obliged to you. In fact, I know I am getting absurdly absent-minded. You are quite justified, sir--perfectly justified. Indeed, I am indebted to you. The thing shall end. And now, sir, I have already brought you farther than I should have done."  "I do hope my impertinence--"  "Not at all, sir, not at all."  We regarded each other for a moment. I raised my hat and wished him a good evening. He responded convulsively, and so we went our ways.  At the stile I looked back at his receding figure. His bearing had changed remarkably, he seemed limp, shrunken. The contrast with his former gesticulating, zuzzoing self took me in some absurd way as pathetic. I watched him out of sight. Then wishing very heartily I had kept to my own business, I returned to my bungalow and my play.  The next evening I saw nothing of him, nor the next. But he was very much in my mind, and it had occurred to me that as a sentimental comic character he might serve a useful purpose in the development of my plot. The third day he called upon me.  For a time I was puzzled to think what had brought him. He made indifferent conversation in the most formal way, then abruptly he came to business. He wanted to buy me out of my bungalow.  "You see," he said, "I don't blame you in the least, but you've destroyed a habit, and it disorganises my day. I've walked past here for years--years. No doubt I've hummed.... You've made all that impossible!"  I suggested he might try some other direction.  "No. There is no other direction. This is the only one. I've inquired. And now--every afternoon at four--I come to a dead wall."  "But, my dear sir, if the thing is so important to you--"  "It's vital. You see, I'm--I'm an investigator--I am engaged in a scientific research. I live--" he paused and seemed to think. "Just over there," he said, and pointed suddenly dangerously near my eye. "The house with white chimneys you see just over the trees. And my circumstances are abnormal--abnormal. I am on the point of completing one of the most important--demonstrations--I can assure you one of the most important demonstrations that have ever been made. It requires constant thought, constant mental ease and activity. And the afternoon was my brightest time!--effervescing with new ideas--new points of view."  "But why not come by still?"  "It would be all different. I should be self-conscious. I should think of you at your play--watching me irritated--instead of thinking of my work. No! I must have the bungalow."  I meditated. Naturally, I wanted to think the matter over thoroughly before anything decisive was said. I was generally ready enough for business in those days, and selling always attracted me; but in the first place it was not my bungalow, and even if I sold it to him at a good price I might get inconvenienced in the delivery of goods if the current owner got wind of the transaction, and in the second I was, well--undischarged. It was clearly a business that required delicate handling. Moreover, the possibility of his being in pursuit of some valuable invention also interested me. It occurred to me that I would like to know more of this research, not with any dishonest intention, but simply with an idea that to know what it was would be a relief from play-writing. I threw out feelers.  He was quite willing to supply information. Indeed, once he was fairly under way the conversation became a monologue. He talked like a man long pent up, who has had it over with himself again and again. He talked for nearly an hour, and I must confess I found it a pretty stiff bit of listening. But through it all there was the undertone of satisfaction one feels when one is neglecting work one has set oneself. During that first interview I gathered very little of the drift of his work. Half his words were technicalities entirely strange to me, and he illustrated one or two points with what he was pleased to call elementary mathematics, computing on an envelope with a copying-ink pencil, in a manner that made it hard even to seem to understand. "Yes," I said, "yes. Go on!" Nevertheless I made out enough to convince me that he was no mere crank playing at discoveries. In spite of his crank-like appearance there was a force about him that made that impossible. Whatever it was, it was a thing with mechanical possibilities. He told me of a work-shed he had, and of three assistants--originally jobbing carpenters--whom he had trained. Now, from the work-shed to the patent office is clearly only one step. He invited me to see those things. I accepted readily, and took care, by a remark or so, to underline that. The proposed transfer of the bungalow remained very conveniently in suspense.  At last he rose to depart, with an apology for the length of his call. Talking over his work was, he said, a pleasure enjoyed only too rarely. It was not often he found such an intelligent listener as myself, he mingled very little with professional scientific men.  "So much pettiness," he explained; "so much intrigue! And really, when one has an idea--a novel, fertilising idea--I don't want to be uncharitable, but--"  I am a man who believes in impulses. I made what was perhaps a rash proposition. But you must remember, that I had been alone, play-writing in Lympne, for fourteen days, and my compunction for his ruined walk still hung about me. "Why not," said I, "make this your new habit? In the place of the one I spoilt? At least, until we can settle about the bungalow. What you want is to turn over your work in your mind. That you have always done during your afternoon walk. Unfortunately that's over--you can't get things back as they were. But why not come and talk about your work to me; use me as a sort of wall against which you may throw your thoughts and catch them again? It's certain I don't know enough to steal your ideas myself--and I know no scientific men--"  I stopped. He was considering. Evidently the thing, attracted him. "But I'm afraid I should bore you," he said.  "You think I'm too dull?"  "Oh, no; but technicalities--"  "Anyhow, you've interested me immensely this afternoon."  "Of course it would be a great help to me. Nothing clears up one's ideas so much as explaining them. Hitherto--"  "My dear sir, say no more."  "But really can you spare the time?"  "There is no rest like change of occupation," I said, with profound conviction.  The affair was over. On my verandah steps he turned. "I am already greatly indebted to you," he said.  I made an interrogative noise.  "You have completely cured me of that ridiculous habit of humming," he explained.  I think I said I was glad to be of any service to him, and he turned away.  Immediately the train of thought that our conversation had suggested must have resumed its sway. His arms began to wave in their former fashion. The faint echo of "zuzzoo" came back to me on the breeze....  Well, after all, that was not my affair....  He came the next day, and again the next day after that, and delivered two lectures on physics to our mutual satisfaction. He talked with an air of being extremely lucid about the "ether" and "tubes of force," and "gravitational potential," and things like that, and I sat in my other folding-chair and said, "Yes," "Go on," "I follow you," to keep him going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he ever suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a central figure in a good farce and let all this other stuff slide. And then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.  At the earliest opportunity I went to see his house. It was large and carelessly furnished; there were no servants other than his three assistants, and his dietary and private life were characterised by a philosophical simplicity. He was a water-drinker, a vegetarian, and all those logical disciplinary things. But the sight of his equipment settled many doubts. It looked like business from cellar to attic--an amazing little place to find in an out-of-the-way village. The ground-floor rooms contained benches and apparatus, the bakehouse and scullery boiler had developed into respectable furnaces, dynamos occupied the cellar, and there was a gasometer in the garden. He showed it to me with all the confiding zest of a man who has been living too much alone. His seclusion was overflowing now in an excess of confidence, and I had the good luck to be the recipient.  The three assistants were creditable specimens of the class of "handy-men" from which they came. Conscientious if unintelligent, strong, civil, and willing. One, Spargus, who did the cooking and all the metal work, had been a sailor; a second, Gibbs, was a joiner; and the third was an ex-jobbing gardener, and now general assistant. They were the merest labourers. All the intelligent work was done by Cavor. Theirs was the darkest ignorance compared even with my muddled impression.  And now, as to the nature of these inquiries. Here, unhappily, comes a grave difficulty. I am no scientific expert, and if I were to attempt to set forth in the highly scientific language of Mr. Cavor the aim to which his experiments tended, I am afraid I should confuse not only the reader but myself, and almost certainly I should make some blunder that would bring upon me the mockery of every up-to-date student of mathematical physics in the country. The best thing I can do therefore is, I think to give my impressions in my own inexact language, without any attempt to wear a garment of knowledge to which I have no claim.  The object of Mr. Cavor's search was a substance that should be "opaque"--he used some other word I have forgotten, but "opaque" conveys the idea--to "all forms of radiant energy." "Radiant energy," he made me understand, was anything like light or heat, or those Rontgen Rays there was so much talk about a year or so ago, or the electric waves of Marconi, or gravitation. All these things, he said, _radiate_ out from centres, and act on bodies at a distance, whence comes the term "radiant energy." Now almost all substances are opaque to some form or other of radiant energy. Glass, for example, is transparent to light, but much less so to heat, so that it is useful as a fire-screen; and alum is transparent to light, but blocks heat completely. A solution of iodine in carbon bisulphide, on the other hand, completely blocks light, but is quite transparent to heat. It will hide a fire from you, but permit all its warmth to reach you. Metals are not only opaque to light and heat, but also to electrical energy, which passes through both iodine solution and glass almost as though they were not interposed. And so on.  Now all known substances are "transparent" to gravitation. You can use screens of various sorts to cut off the light or heat, or electrical influence of the sun, or the warmth of the earth from anything; you can screen things by sheets of metal from Marconi's rays, but nothing will cut off the gravitational attraction of the sun or the gravitational attraction of the earth. Yet why there should be nothing is hard to say. Cavor did not see why such a substance should not exist, and certainly I could not tell him. I had never thought of such a possibility before. He showed me by calculations on paper, which Lord Kelvin, no doubt, or Professor Lodge, or Professor Karl Pearson, or any of those great scientific people might have understood, but which simply reduced me to a hopeless muddle, that not only was such a substance possible, but that it must satisfy certain conditions. It was an amazing piece of reasoning. Much as it amazed and exercised me at the time, it would be impossible to reproduce it here. "Yes," I said to it all, "yes; go on!" Suffice it for this story that he believed he might be able to manufacture this possible substance opaque to gravitation out of a complicated alloy of metals and something new--a new element, I fancy--called, I believe, _helium_, which was sent to him from London in sealed stone jars. Doubt has been thrown upon this detail, but I am almost certain it was _helium_ he had sent him in sealed stone jars. It was certainly something very gaseous and thin. If only I had taken notes...  But then, how was I to foresee the necessity of taking notes?  Any one with the merest germ of an imagination will understand the extraordinary possibilities of such a substance, and will sympathise a little with the emotion I felt as this understanding emerged from the haze of abstruse phrases in which Cavor expressed himself. Comic relief in a play indeed! It was some time before I would believe that I had interpreted him aright, and I was very careful not to ask questions that would have enabled him to gauge the profundity of misunderstanding into which he dropped his daily exposition. But no one reading the story of it here will sympathise fully, because from my barren narrative it will be impossible to gather the strength of my conviction that this astonishing substance was positively going to be made.  I do not recall that I gave my play an hour's consecutive work at any time after my visit to his house. My imagination had other things to do. There seemed no limit to the possibilities of the stuff; whichever way I tried I came on miracles and revolutions. For example, if one wanted to lift a weight, however enormous, one had only to get a sheet of this substance beneath it, and one might lift it with a straw. My first natural impulse was to apply this principle to guns and ironclads, and all the material and methods of war, and from that to shipping, locomotion, building, every conceivable form of human industry. The chance that had brought me into the very birth-chamber of this new time--it was an epoch, no less--was one of those chances that come once in a thousand years. The thing unrolled, it expanded and expanded. Among other things I saw in it my redemption as a business man. I saw a parent company, and daughter companies, applications to right of us, applications to left, rings and trusts, privileges, and concessions spreading and spreading, until one vast, stupendous Cavorite company ran and ruled the world.  And I was in it!  I took my line straight away. I knew I was staking everything, but I jumped there and then.  "We're on absolutely the biggest thing that has ever been invented," I said, and put the accent on "we." "If you want to keep me out of this, you'll have to do it with a gun. I'm coming down to be your fourth labourer to-morrow."  He seemed surprised at my enthusiasm, but not a bit suspicious or hostile. Rather, he was self-depreciatory. He looked at me doubtfully. "But do you really think--?" he said. "And your play! How about that play?"  "It's vanished!" I cried. "My dear sir, don't you see what you've got? Don't you see what you're going to do?"  That was merely a rhetorical turn, but positively, he didn't. At first I could not believe it. He had not had the beginning of the inkling of an idea. This astonishing little man had been working on purely theoretical grounds the whole time! When he said it was "the most important" research the world had ever seen, he simply meant it squared up so many theories, settled so much that was in doubt; he had troubled no more about the application of the stuff he was going to turn out than if he had been a machine that makes guns. This was a possible substance, and he was going to make it! V'la tout, as the Frenchman says.  Beyond that, he was childish! If he made it, it would go down to posterity as Cavorite or Cavorine, and he would be made an F.R.S., and his portrait given away as a scientific worthy with Nature, and things like that. And that was all he saw! He would have dropped this bombshell into the world as though he had discovered a new species of gnat, if it had not happened that I had come along. And there it would have lain and fizzled, like one or two other little things these scientific people have lit and dropped about us.  When I realised this, it was I did the talking, and Cavor who said, "Go on!" I jumped up. I paced the room, gesticulating like a boy of twenty. I tried to make him understand his duties and responsibilities in the matter--_our_ duties and responsibilities in the matter. I assured him we might make wealth enough to work any sort of social revolution we fancied, we might own and order the whole world. I told him of companies and patents, and the case for secret processes. All these things seemed to take him much as his mathematics had taken me. A look of perplexity came into his ruddy little face. He stammered something about indifference to wealth, but I brushed all that aside. He had got to be rich, and it was no good his stammering. I gave him to understand the sort of man I was, and that I had had very considerable business experience. I did not tell him I was an undischarged bankrupt at the time, because that was temporary, but I think I reconciled my evident poverty with my financial claims. And quite insensibly, in the way such projects grow, the understanding of a Cavorite monopoly grew up between us. He was to make the stuff, and I was to make the boom.  I stuck like a leech to the "we"--"you" and "I" didn't exist for me.  His idea was that the profits I spoke of might go to endow research, but that, of course, was a matter we had to settle later. "That's all right," I shouted, "that's all right." The great point, as I insisted, was to get the thing done.  "Here is a substance," I cried, "no home, no factory, no fortress, no ship can dare to be without--more universally applicable even than a patent medicine. There isn't a solitary aspect of it, not one of its ten thousand possible uses that will not make us rich, Cavor, beyond the dreams of avarice!"  "No!" he said. "I begin to see. It's extraordinary how one gets new points of view by talking over things!"  "And as it happens you have just talked to the right man!"  "I suppose no one," he said, "is absolutely _averse_ to enormous wealth. Of course there is one thing--"  He paused. I stood still.  "It is just possible, you know, that we may not be able to make it after all! It may be one of those things that are a theoretical possibility, but a practical absurdity. Or when we make it, there may be some little hitch!"  "We'll tackle the hitch when it comes." said I.      Chapter 2     The First Making of Cavorite  But Cavor's fears were groundless, so far as the actual making was concerned. On the 14th of October, 1899, this incredible substance was made!  Oddly enough, it was made at last by accident, when Mr. Cavor least expected it. He had fused together a number of metals and certain other things--I wish I knew the particulars now!--and he intended to leave the mixture a week and then allow it to cool slowly. Unless he had miscalculated, the last stage in the combination would occur when the stuff sank to a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. But it chanced that, unknown to Cavor, dissension had arisen about the furnace tending. Gibbs, who had previously seen to this, had suddenly attempted to shift it to the man who had been a gardener, on the score that coal was soil, being dug, and therefore could not possibly fall within the province of a joiner; the man who had been a jobbing gardener alleged, however, that coal was a metallic or ore-like substance, let alone that he was cook. But Spargus insisted on Gibbs doing the coaling, seeing that he was a joiner and that coal is notoriously fossil wood. Consequently Gibbs ceased to replenish the furnace, and no one else did so, and Cavor was too much immersed in certain interesting problems concerning a Cavorite flying machine (neglecting the resistance of the air and one or two other points) to perceive that anything was wrong. And the premature birth of his invention took place just as he was coming across the field to my bungalow for our afternoon talk and tea.  I remember the occasion with extreme vividness. The water was boiling, and everything was prepared, and the sound of his "zuzzoo" had brought me out upon the verandah. His active little figure was black against the autumnal sunset, and to the right the chimneys of his house just rose above a gloriously tinted group of trees. Remoter rose the Wealden Hills, faint and blue, while to the left the hazy marsh spread out spacious and serene. And then--  The chimneys jerked heavenward, smashing into a string of bricks as they rose, and the roof and a miscellany of furniture followed. Then overtaking them came a huge white flame. The trees about the building swayed and whirled and tore themselves to pieces, that sprang towards the flare. My ears were smitten with a clap of thunder that left me deaf on one side for life, and all about me windows smashed, unheeded.  I took three steps from the verandah towards Cavor's house, and even as I did so came the wind.  Instantly my coat tails were over my head, and I was progressing in great leaps and bounds, and quite against my will, towards him. In the same moment the discoverer was seized, whirled about, and flew through the screaming air. I saw one of my chimney pots hit the ground within six yards of me, leap a score of feet, and so hurry in great strides towards the focus of the disturbance. Cavor, kicking and flapping, came down again, rolled over and over on the ground for a space, struggled up and was lifted and borne forward at an enormous velocity, vanishing at last among the labouring, lashing trees that writhed about his house.  A mass of smoke and ashes, and a square of bluish shining substance rushed up towards the zenith. A large fragment of fencing came sailing past me, dropped edgeways, hit the ground and fell flat, and then the worst was over. The aerial commotion fell swiftly until it was a mere strong gale, and I became once more aware that I had breath and feet. By leaning back against the wind I managed to stop, and could collect such wits as still remained to me.  In that instant the whole face of the world had changed. The tranquil sunset had vanished, the sky was dark with scurrying clouds, everything was flattened and swaying with the gale. I glanced back to see if my bungalow was still in a general way standing, then staggered forwards towards the trees amongst which Cavor had vanished, and through whose tall and leaf-denuded branches shone the flames of his burning house.  I entered the copse, dashing from one tree to another and clinging to them, and for a space I sought him in vain. Then amidst a heap of smashed branches and fencing that had banked itself against a portion of his garden wall I perceived something stir. I made a run for this, but before I reached it a brown object separated itself, rose on two muddy legs, and protruded two drooping, bleeding hands. Some tattered ends of garment fluttered out from its middle portion and streamed before the wind.  For a moment I did not recognise this earthy lump, and then I saw that it was Cavor, caked in the mud in which he had rolled. He leant forward against the wind, rubbing the dirt from his eyes and mouth.  He extended a muddy lump of hand, and staggered a pace towards me. His face worked with emotion, little lumps of mud kept falling from it. He looked as damaged and pitiful as any living creature I have ever seen, and his remark therefore amazed me exceedingly.  "Gratulate me," he gasped; "gratulate me!"  "Congratulate you!" said I. "Good heavens! What for?"  "I've done it."  "You _have_. What on earth caused that explosion?"  A gust of wind blew his words away. I understood him to say that it wasn't an explosion at all. The wind hurled me into collision with him, and we stood clinging to one another.  "Try and get back--to my bungalow," I bawled in his ear. He did not hear me, and shouted something about "three martyrs--science," and also something about "not much good." At the time he laboured under the impression that his three attendants had perished in the whirlwind. Happily this was incorrect. Directly he had left for my bungalow they had gone off to the public-house in Lympne to discuss the question of the furnaces over some trivial refreshment.  I repeated my suggestion of getting back to my bungalow, and this time he understood. We clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at last to reach the shelter of as much roof as was left to me. For a space we sat in arm-chairs and panted. All the windows were broken, and the lighter articles of furniture were in great disorder, but no irrevocable damage was done. Happily the kitchen door had stood the pressure upon it, so that all my crockery and cooking materials had survived. The oil stove was still burning, and I put on the water to boil again for tea. And that prepared, I could turn on Cavor for his explanation.  "Quite correct," he insisted; "quite correct. I've done it, and it's all right."  "But," I protested. "All right! Why, there can't be a rick standing, or a fence or a thatched roof undamaged for twenty miles round...."  "It's all right--_really_. I didn't, of course, foresee this little upset. My mind was preoccupied with another problem, and I'm apt to disregard these practical side issues. But it's all right--"  "My dear sir," I cried, "don't you see you've done thousands of pounds' worth of damage?"  "There, I throw myself on your discretion. I'm not a practical man, of course, but don't you think they will regard it as a cyclone?"  "But the explosion--"  "It was not an explosion. It's perfectly simple. Only, as I say, I'm apt to overlook these little things. Its that zuzzoo business on a larger scale. Inadvertently I made this substance of mine, this Cavorite, in a thin, wide sheet...."  He paused. "You are quite clear that the stuff is opaque to gravitation, that it cuts off things from gravitating towards each other?"  "Yes," said I. "Yes."  "Well, so soon as it reached a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and the process of its manufacture was complete, the air above it, the portions of roof and ceiling and floor above it ceased to have weight. I suppose you know--everybody knows nowadays--that, as a usual thing, the air _has_ weight, that it presses on everything at the surface of the earth, presses in all directions, with a pressure of fourteen and a half pounds to the square inch?"  "I know that," said I. "Go on."  "I know that too," he remarked. "Only this shows you how useless knowledge is unless you apply it. You see, over our Cavorite this ceased to be the case, the air there ceased to exert any pressure, and the air round it and not over the Cavorite was exerting a pressure of fourteen pounds and a half to the square in upon this suddenly weightless air. Ah! you begin to see! The air all about the Cavorite crushed in upon the air above it with irresistible force. The air above the Cavorite was forced upward violently, the air that rushed in to replace it immediately lost weight, ceased to exert any pressure, followed suit, blew the ceiling through and the roof off....  "You perceive," he said, "it formed a sort of atmospheric fountain, a kind of chimney in the atmosphere. And if the Cavorite itself hadn't been loose and so got sucked up the chimney, does it occur to you what would have happened?"  I thought. "I suppose," I said, "the air would be rushing up and up over that infernal piece of stuff now."  "Precisely," he said. "A huge fountain--"  "Spouting into space! Good heavens! Why, it would have squirted all the atmosphere of the earth away! It would have robbed the world of air! It would have been the death of all mankind! That little lump of stuff!"  "Not exactly into space," said Cavor, "but as bad--practically. It would have whipped the air off the world as one peels a banana, and flung it thousands of miles. It would have dropped back again, of course--but on an asphyxiated world! From our point of view very little better than if it never came back!"  I stared. As yet I was too amazed to realise how all my expectations had been upset. "What do you mean to do now?" I asked.  "In the first place if I may borrow a garden trowel I will remove some of this earth with which I am encased, and then if I may avail myself of your domestic conveniences I will have a bath. This done, we will converse more at leisure. It will be wise, I think"--he laid a muddy hand on my arm--"if nothing were said of this affair beyond ourselves. I know I have caused great damage--probably even dwelling-houses may be ruined here and there upon the country-side. But on the other hand, I cannot possibly pay for the damage I have done, and if the real cause of this is published, it will lead only to heartburning and the obstruction of my work. One cannot foresee everything, you know, and I cannot consent for one moment to add the burthen of practical considerations to my theorising. Later on, when you have come in with your practical mind, and Cavorite is floated--floated is the word, isn't it?--and it has realised all you anticipate for it, we may set matters right with these persons. But not now--not now. If no other explanation is offered, people, in the present unsatisfactory state of meteorological science, will ascribe all this to a cyclone; there might be a public subscription, and as my house has collapsed and been burnt, I should in that case receive a considerable share in the compensation, which would be extremely helpful to the prosecution of our researches. But if it is known that _I_ caused this, there will be no public subscription, and everybody will be put out. Practically I should never get a chance of working in peace again. My three assistants may or may not have perished. That is a detail. If they have, it is no great loss; they were more zealous than able, and this premature event must be largely due to their joint neglect of the furnace. If they have not perished, I doubt if they have the intelligence to explain the affair. They will accept the cyclone story. And if during the temporary unfitness of my house for occupation, I may lodge in one of the untenanted rooms of this bungalow of yours--"  He paused and regarded me.  A man of such possibilities, I reflected, is no ordinary guest to entertain.  "Perhaps," said I, rising to my feet, "we had better begin by looking for a trowel," and I led the way to the scattered vestiges of the greenhouse.  And while he was having his bath I considered the entire question alone. It was clear there were drawbacks to Mr. Cavor's society I had not foreseen. The absentmindedness that had just escaped depopulating the terrestrial globe, might at any moment result in some other grave inconvenience. On the other hand I was young, my affairs were in a mess, and I was in just the mood for reckless adventure--with a chance of something good at the end of it. I had quite settled in my mind that I was to have half at least in that aspect of the affair. Fortunately I held my bungalow, as I have already explained, on a three-year agreement, without being responsible for repairs; and my furniture, such as there was of it, had been hastily purchased, was unpaid for, insured, and altogether devoid of associations. In the end I decided to keep on with him, and see the business through.  Certainly the aspect of things had changed very greatly. I no longer doubted at all the enormous possibilities of the substance, but I began to have doubts about the gun-carriage and the patent boots. We set to work at once to reconstruct his laboratory and proceed with our experiments. Cavor talked more on my level than he had ever done before, when it came to the question of how we should make the stuff next.  "Of course we must make it again," he said, with a sort of glee I had not expected in him, "of course we must make it again. We have caught a Tartar, perhaps, but we have left the theoretical behind us for good and all. If we can possibly avoid wrecking this little planet of ours, we will. But--there must be risks! There must be. In experimental work there always are. And here, as a practical man, _you_ must come in. For my own part it seems to me we might make it edgeways, perhaps, and very thin. Yet I don't know. I have a certain dim perception of another method. I can hardly explain it yet. But curiously enough it came into my mind, while I was rolling over and over in the mud before the wind, and very doubtful how the whole adventure was to end, as being absolutely the thing I ought to have done."  Even with my aid we found some little difficulty, and meanwhile we kept at work restoring the laboratory. There was plenty to do before it became absolutely necessary to decide upon the precise form and method of our second attempt. Our only hitch was the strike of the three labourers, who objected to my activity as a foreman. But that matter we compromised after two days' delay.      Chapter 3     The Building of the sphere  I remember the occasion very distinctly when Cavor told me of his idea of the sphere. He had had intimations of it before, but at the time it seemed to come to him in a rush. We were returning to the bungalow for tea, and on the way he fell humming. Suddenly he shouted, "That's it! That finishes it! A sort of roller blind!"  "Finishes what?" I asked.  "Space--anywhere! The moon."  "What do you mean?"  "Mean? Why--it must be a sphere! That's what I mean!"  I saw I was out of it, and for a time I let him talk in his own fashion. I hadn't the ghost of an idea then of his drift. But after he had taken tea he made it clear to me.  "It's like this," he said. "Last time I ran this stuff that cuts things off from gravitation into a flat tank with an overlap that held it down. And directly it had cooled and the manufacture was completed all that uproar happened, nothing above it weighed anything, the air went squirting up, the house squirted up, and if the stuff itself hadn't squirted up too, I don't know what would have happened! But suppose the substance is loose, and quite free to go up?"  "It will go up at once!"  "Exactly. With no more disturbance than firing a big gun."  "But what good will that do?"  "I'm going up with it!"  I put down my teacup and stared at him.  "Imagine a sphere," he explained, "large enough to hold two people and their luggage. It will be made of steel lined with thick glass; it will contain a proper store of solidified air, concentrated food, water distilling apparatus, and so forth. And enamelled, as it were, on the outer steel--"  "Cavorite?"  "Yes."  "But how will you get inside?"  "There was a similar problem about a dumpling."  "Yes, I know. But how?"  "That's perfectly easy. An air-tight manhole is all that is needed. That, of course, will have to be a little complicated; there will have to be a valve, so that things may be thrown out, if necessary, without much loss of air."  "Like Jules Verne's thing in _A Trip to the Moon_."  But Cavor was not a reader of fiction.  "I begin to see," I said slowly. "And you could get in and screw yourself up while the Cavorite was warm, and as soon as it cooled it would become impervious to gravitation, and off you would fly--"  "At a tangent."  "You would go off in a straight line--" I stopped abruptly. "What is to prevent the thing travelling in a straight line into space for ever?" I asked. "You're not safe to get anywhere, and if you do--how will you get back?"  "I've just thought of that," said Cavor. "That's what I meant when I said the thing is finished. The inner glass sphere can be air-tight, and, except for the manhole, continuous, and the steel sphere can be made in sections, each section capable of rolling up after the fashion of a roller blind. These can easily be worked by springs, and released and checked by electricity conveyed by platinum wires fused through the glass. All that is merely a question of detail. So you see, that except for the thickness of the blind rollers, the Cavorite exterior of the sphere will consist of windows or blinds, whichever you like to call them. Well, when all these windows or blinds are shut, no light, no heat, no gravitation, no radiant energy of any sort will get at the inside of the sphere, it will fly on through space in a straight line, as you say. But open a window, imagine one of the windows open. Then at once any heavy body that chances to be in that direction will attract us--"  I sat taking it in.  "You see?" he said.  "Oh, I _see_."  "Practically we shall be able to tack about in space just as we wish. Get attracted by this and that."  "Oh, yes. That's clear enough. Only--"  "Well?"  "I don't quite see what we shall do it for! It's really only jumping off the world and back again."  "Surely! For example, one might go to the moon."  "And when one got there? What would you find?"  "We should see--Oh! consider the new knowledge."  "Is there air there?"  "There may be."  "It's a fine idea," I said, "but it strikes me as a large order all the same. The moon! I'd much rather try some smaller things first."  "They're out of the question, because of the air difficulty."  "Why not apply that idea of spring blinds--Cavorite blinds in strong steel cases--to lifting weights?"  "It wouldn't work," he insisted. "After all, to go into outer space is not so much worse, if at all, than a polar expedition. Men go on polar expeditions."  "Not business men. And besides, they get paid for polar expeditions. And if anything goes wrong there are relief parties. But this--it's just firing ourselves off the world for nothing."  "Call it prospecting."  "You'll have to call it that.... One might make a book of it perhaps," I said.  "I have no doubt there will be minerals," said Cavor.  "For example?"  "Oh! sulphur, ores, gold perhaps, possibly new elements."  "Cost of carriage," I said. "You know you're not a practical man. The moon's a quarter of a million miles away."  "It seems to me it wouldn't cost much to cart any weight anywhere if you packed it in a Cavorite case."  I had not thought of that. "Delivered free on head of purchaser, eh?"  "It isn't as though we were confined to the moon."  "You mean?"  "There's Mars--clear atmosphere, novel surroundings, exhilarating sense of lightness. It might be pleasant to go there."  "Is there air on Mars?"  "Oh, yes!"  "Seems as though you might run it as a sanatorium. By the way, how far is Mars?"  "Two hundred million miles at present," said Cavor airily; "and you go close by the sun."  My imagination was picking itself up again. "After all," I said, "there's something in these things. There's travel--"  An extraordinary possibility came rushing into my mind. Suddenly I saw, as in a vision, the whole solar system threaded with Cavorite liners and spheres deluxe. "Rights of pre-emption," came floating into my head--planetary rights of pre-emption. I recalled the old Spanish monopoly in American gold. It wasn't as though it was just this planet or that--it was all of them. I stared at Cavor's rubicund face, and suddenly my imagination was leaping and dancing. I stood up, I walked up and down; my tongue was unloosened.  "I'm beginning to take it in," I said; "I'm beginning to take it in." The transition from doubt to enthusiasm seemed to take scarcely any time at all. "But this is tremendous!" I cried. "This is Imperial! I haven't been dreaming of this sort of thing."  Once the chill of my opposition was removed, his own pent-up excitement had play. He too got up and paced. He too gesticulated and shouted. We behaved like men inspired. We _were_ men inspired.  "We'll settle all that!" he said in answer to some incidental difficulty that had pulled me up. "We'll soon settle that! We'll start the drawings for mouldings this very night."  "We'll start them now," I responded, and we hurried off to the laboratory to begin upon this work forthwith.  I was like a child in Wonderland all that night. The dawn found us both still at work--we kept our electric light going heedless of the day. I remember now exactly how these drawings looked. I shaded and tinted while Cavor drew--smudged and haste-marked they were in every line, but wonderfully correct. We got out the orders for the steel blinds and frames we needed from that night's work, and the glass sphere was designed within a week. We gave up our afternoon conversations and our old routine altogether. We worked, and we slept and ate when we could work no longer for hunger and fatigue. Our enthusiasm infected even our three men, though they had no idea what the sphere was for. Through those days the man Gibbs gave up walking, and went everywhere, even across the room, at a sort of fussy run.  And it grew--the sphere. December passed, January--I spent a day with a broom sweeping a path through the snow from bungalow to laboratory--February, March. By the end of March the completion was in sight. In January had come a team of horses, a huge packing-case; we had our thick glass sphere now ready, and in position under the crane we had rigged to sling it into the steel shell. All the bars and blinds of the steel shell--it was not really a spherical shell, but polyhedral, with a roller blind to each facet--had arrived by February, and the lower half was bolted together. The Cavorite was half made by March, the metallic paste had gone through two of the stages in its manufacture, and we had plastered quite half of it on to the steel bars and blinds. It was astonishing how closely we kept to the lines of Cavor's first inspiration in working out the scheme. When the bolting together of the sphere was finished, he proposed to remove the rough roof of the temporary laboratory in which the work was done, and build a furnace about it. So the last stage of Cavorite making, in which the paste is heated to a dull red glow in a stream of helium, would be accomplished when it was already on the sphere.  And then we had to discuss and decide what provisions we were to take--compressed foods, concentrated essences, steel cylinders containing reserve oxygen, an arrangement for removing carbonic acid and waste from the air and restoring oxygen by means of sodium peroxide, water condensers, and so forth. I remember the little heap they made in the corner--tins, and rolls, and boxes--convincingly matter-of-fact.  It was a strenuous time, with little chance of thinking. But one day, when we were drawing near the end, an odd mood came over me. I had been bricking up the furnace all the morning, and I sat down by these possessions dead beat. Everything seemed dull and incredible.  "But look here, Cavor," I said. "After all! What's it all for?"  He smiled. "The thing now is to go."  "The moon," I reflected. "But what do you expect? I thought the moon was a dead world."  He shrugged his shoulders.  "We're going to see."  "Are we?" I said, and stared before me.  "You are tired," he remarked. "You'd better take a walk this afternoon."  "No," I said obstinately; "I'm going to finish this brickwork."  And I did, and insured myself a night of insomnia. I don't think I have ever had such a night. I had some bad times before my business collapse, but the very worst of those was sweet slumber compared to this infinity of aching wakefulness. I was suddenly in the most enormous funk at the thing we were going to do.  I do not remember before that night thinking at all of the risks we were running. Now they came like that array of spectres that once beleaguered Prague, and camped around me. The strangeness of what we were about to do, the unearthliness of it, overwhelmed me. I was like a man awakened out of pleasant dreams to the most horrible surroundings. I lay, eyes wide open, and the sphere seemed to get more flimsy and feeble, and Cavor more unreal and fantastic, and the whole enterprise madder and madder every moment.  I got out of bed and wandered about. I sat at the window and stared at the immensity of space. Between the stars was the void, the unfathomable darkness! I tried to recall the fragmentary knowledge of astronomy I had gained in my irregular reading, but it was all too vague to furnish any idea of the things we might expect. At last I got back to bed and snatched some moments of sleep--moments of nightmare rather--in which I fell and fell and fell for evermore into the abyss of the sky.  I astonished Cavor at breakfast. I told him shortly, "I'm not coming with you in the sphere."  I met all his protests with a sullen persistence. "The thing's too mad," I said, "and I won't come. The thing's too mad."  I would not go with him to the laboratory. I fretted bout my bungalow for a time, and then took hat and stick and set out alone, I knew not whither. It chanced to be a glorious morning: a warm wind and deep blue sky, the first green of spring abroad, and multitudes of birds singing. I lunched on beef and beer in a little public-house near Elham, and startled the landlord by remarking apropos of the weather, "A man who leaves the world when days of this sort are about is a fool!"  "That's what I says when I heerd on it!" said the landlord, and I found that for one poor soul at least this world had proved excessive, and there had been a throat-cutting. I went on with a new twist to my thoughts.  In the afternoon I had a pleasant sleep in a sunny place, and went on my way refreshed. I came to a comfortable-looking inn near Canterbury. It was bright with creepers, and the landlady was a clean old woman and took my eye. I found I had just enough money to pay for my lodging with her. I decided to stop the night there. She was a talkative body, and among many other particulars learnt she had never been to London. "Canterbury's as far as ever I been," she said. "I'm not one of your gad-about sort."  "How would you like a trip to the moon?" I cried.  "I never did hold with them ballooneys," she said evidently under the impression that this was a common excursion enough. "I wouldn't go up in one--not for ever so."  This struck me as being funny. After I had supped I sat on a bench by the door of the inn and gossiped with two labourers about brickmaking, and motor cars, and the cricket of last year. And in the sky a faint new crescent, blue and vague as a distant Alp, sank westward over the sun.  The next day I returned to Cavor. "I am coming," I said. "I've been a little out of order, that's all."  That was the only time I felt any serious doubt our enterprise. Nerves purely! After that I worked a little more carefully, and took a trudge for an hour every day. And at last, save for the heating in the furnace, our labours were at an end.      Chapter 4     Inside the Sphere  "Go on," said Cavor, as I sat across the edge of the manhole, and looked down into the black interior of the sphere. We two were alone. It was evening, the sun had set, and the stillness of the twilight was upon everything.  I drew my other leg inside and slid down the smooth glass to the bottom of the sphere, then turned to take the cans of food and other impedimenta from Cavor. The interior was warm, the thermometer stood at eighty, and as we should lose little or none of this by radiation, we were dressed in shoes and thin flannels. We had, however, a bundle of thick woollen clothing and several thick blankets to guard against mischance.  By Cavor's direction I placed the packages, the cylinders of oxygen, and so forth, loosely about my feet, and soon we had everything in. He walked about the roofless shed for a time seeking anything we had overlooked, and then crawled in after me. I noted something in his hand.  "What have you got there?" I asked.  "Haven't you brought anything to read?"  "Good Lord! No."  "I forgot to tell you. There are uncertainties-- The voyage may last-- We may be weeks!"  "But--"  "We shall be floating in this sphere with absolutely no occupation."  "I wish I'd known--"  He peered out of the manhole. "Look!" he said. "There's something there!"  "Is there time?"  "We shall be an hour."  I looked out. It was an old number of _Tit-Bits_ that one of the men must have brought. Farther away in the corner I saw a torn _Lloyd's News_. I scrambled back into the sphere with these things. "What have you got?" I said.  I took the book from his hand and read, "The Works of William Shakespeare".  He coloured slightly. "My education has been so purely scientific--" he said apologetically.  "Never read him?"  "Never."  "He knew a little, you know--in an irregular sort of way."  "Precisely what I am told," said Cavor.  I assisted him to screw in the glass cover of the manhole, and then he pressed a stud to close the corresponding blind in the outer case. The little oblong of twilight vanished. We were in darkness. For a time neither of us spoke. Although our case would not be impervious to sound, everything was very still. I perceived there was nothing to grip when the shock of our start should come, and I realised that I should be uncomfortable for want of a chair.  "Why have we no chairs?" I asked.  "I've settled all that," said Cavor. "We won't need them."  "Why not?"  "You will see," he said, in the tone of a man who refuses to talk.  I became silent. Suddenly it had come to me clear and vivid that I was a fool to be inside that sphere. Even now, I asked myself, is to too late to withdraw? The world outside the sphere, I knew, would be cold and inhospitable enough for me--for weeks I had been living on subsidies from Cavor--but after all, would it be as cold as the infinite zero, as inhospitable as empty space? If it had not been for the appearance of cowardice, I believe that even then I should have made him let me out. But I hesitated on that score, and hesitated, and grew fretful and angry, and the time passed.  There came a little jerk, a noise like champagne being uncorked in another room, and a faint whistling sound. For just one instant I had a sense of enormous tension, a transient conviction that my feet were pressing downward with a force of countless tons. It lasted for an infinitesimal time.  But it stirred me to action. "Cavor!" I said into the darkness, "my nerve's in rags. I don't think--"  I stopped. He made no answer.  "Confound it!" I cried; "I'm a fool! What business have I here? I'm not coming, Cavor. The thing's too risky. I'm getting out."  "You can't," he said.  "Can't! We'll soon see about that!"  He made no answer for ten seconds. "It's too late for us to quarrel now, Bedford," he said. "That little jerk was the start. Already we are flying as swiftly as a bullet up into the gulf of space."  "I--" I said, and then it didn't seem to matter what happened. For a time I was, as it were, stunned; I had nothing to say. It was just as if I had never heard of this idea of leaving the world before. Then I perceived an unaccountable change in my bodily sensations. It was a feeling of lightness, of unreality. Coupled with that was a queer sensation in the head, an apoplectic effect almost, and a thumping of blood vessels at the ears. Neither of these feelings diminished as time went on, but at last I got so used to them that I experienced no inconvenience.  I heard a click, and a little glow lamp came into being.  I saw Cavor's face, as white as I felt my own to be. We regarded one another in silence. The transparent blackness of the glass behind him made him seem as though he floated in a void.  "Well, we're committed," I said at last.  "Yes," he said, "we're committed."  "Don't move," he exclaimed, at some suggestion of a gesture. "Let your muscles keep quite lax--as if you were in bed. We are in a little universe of our own. Look at those things!"  He pointed to the loose cases and bundles that had been lying on the blankets in the bottom of the sphere. I was astonished to see that they were floating now nearly a foot from the spherical wall. Then I saw from his shadow that Cavor was no longer leaning against the glass. I thrust out my hand behind me, and found that I too was suspended in space, clear of the glass.  I did not cry out nor gesticulate, but fear came upon me. It was like being held and lifted by something--you know not what. The mere touch of my hand against the glass moved me rapidly. I understood what had happened, but that did not prevent my being afraid. We were cut off from all exterior gravitation, only the attraction of objects within our sphere had effect. Consequently everything that was not fixed to the glass was falling--slowly because of the slightness of our masses--towards the centre of gravity of our little world, which seemed to be somewhere about the middle of the sphere, but rather nearer to myself than Cavor, on account of my greater weight.  "We must turn round," said Cavor, "and float back to back, with the things between us."  It was the strangest sensation conceivable, floating thus loosely in space, at first indeed horribly strange, and when the horror passed, not disagreeable at all, exceeding restful; indeed, the nearest thing in earthly experience to it that I know is lying on a very thick, soft feather bed. But the quality of utter detachment and independence! I had not reckoned on things like this. I had expected a violent jerk at starting, a giddy sense of speed. Instead I felt--as if I were disembodied. It was not like the beginning of a journey; it was like the beginning of a dream.      Chapter 5     The Journey to the Moon  Presently Cavor extinguished the light. He said we had not overmuch energy stored, and that what we had we must economise for reading. For a time, whether it was long or short I do not know, there was nothing but blank darkness.  A question floated up out of the void. "How are we pointing?" I said. "What is our direction?"  "We are flying away from the earth at a tangent, and as the moon is near her third quarter we are going somewhere towards her. I will open a blind--"  Came a click, and then a window in the outer case yawned open. The sky outside was as black as the darkness within the sphere, but the shape of the open window was marked by an infinite number of stars.  Those who have only seen the starry sky from the earth cannot imagine its appearance when the vague, half luminous veil of our air has been withdrawn. The stars we see on earth are the mere scattered survivors that penetrate our misty atmosphere. But now at last I could realise the meaning of the hosts of heaven!  Stranger things we were presently to see, but that airless, star-dusted sky! Of all things, I think that will be one of the last I shall forget.  The little window vanished with a click, another beside it snapped open and instantly closed, and then a third, and for a moment I had to close my eyes because of the blinding splendour of the waning moon.  For a space I had to stare at Cavor and the white-lit things about me to season my eyes to light again, before I could turn them towards that pallid glare.  Four windows were open in order that the gravitation of the moon might act upon all the substances in our sphere. I found I was no longer floating freely in space, but that my feet were resting on the glass in the direction of the moon. The blankets and cases of provisions were also creeping slowly down the glass, and presently came to rest so as to block out a portion of the view. It seemed to me, of course, that I looked "down" when I looked at the moon. On earth "down" means earthward, the way things fall, and "up" the reverse direction. Now the pull of gravitation was towards the moon, and for all I knew to the contrary our earth was overhead. And, of course, when all the Cavorite blinds were closed, "down" was towards the centre of our sphere, and "up" towards its outer wall.  It was curiously unlike earthly experience, too, to have the light coming up to one. On earth light falls from above, or comes slanting down sideways, but here it came from beneath our feet, and to see our shadows we had to look up.  At first it gave me a sort of vertigo to stand only on thick glass and look down upon the moon through hundreds of thousands of miles of vacant space; but this sickness passed very speedily. And then--the splendour of the sight!  The reader may imagine it best if he will lie on the ground some warm summer's night and look between his upraised feet at the moon, but for some reason, probably because the absence of air made it so much more luminous, the moon seemed already considerably larger than it does from earth. The minutest details of its surface were acutely clear. And since we did not see it through air, its outline was bright and sharp, there was no glow or halo about it, and the star-dust that covered the sky came right to its very margin, and marked the outline of its unilluminated part. And as I stood and stared at the moon between my feet, that perception of the impossible that had been with me off and on ever since our start, returned again with tenfold conviction.  "Cavor," I said, "this takes me queerly. Those companies we were going to run, and all that about minerals?"  "Well?"  "I don't see 'em here."  "No," said Cavor; "but you'll get over all that."  "I suppose I'm made to turn right side up again. Still, _this_-- For a moment I could half believe there never was a world."  "That copy of _Lloyd's News_ might help you."  I stared at the paper for a moment, then held it above the level of my face, and found I could read it quite easily. I struck a column of mean little advertisements. "A gentleman of private means is willing to lend money," I read. I knew that gentleman. Then somebody eccentric wanted to sell a Cutaway bicycle, "quite new and cost 15 pounds," for five pounds; and a lady in distress wished to dispose of some fish knives and forks, "a wedding present," at a great sacrifice. No doubt some simple soul was sagely examining these knives and forks, and another triumphantly riding off on that bicycle, and a third trustfully consulting that benevolent gentleman of means even as I read. I laughed, and let the paper drift from my hand.  "Are we visible from the earth?" I asked.  "Why?"  "I knew some one who was rather interested in astronomy. It occurred to me that it would be rather odd if--my friend--chanced to be looking through come telescope."  "It would need the most powerful telescope on earth even now to see us as the minutest speck."  For a time I stared in silence at the moon.  "It's a world," I said; "one feels that infinitely more than one ever did on earth. People perhaps--"  "People!" he exclaimed. "No! Banish all that! Think yourself a sort of ultra-arctic voyager exploring the desolate places of space. Look at it!"  He waved his hand at the shining whiteness below. "It's dead--dead! Vast extinct volcanoes, lava wildernesses, tumbled wastes of snow, or frozen carbonic acid, or frozen air, and everywhere landslip seams and cracks and gulfs. Nothing happens. Men have watched this planet systematically with telescopes for over two hundred years. How much change do you think they have seen?"  "None."  "They have traced two indisputable landslips, a doubtful crack, and one slight periodic change of colour, and that's all."  "I didn't know they'd traced even that."  "Oh, yes. But as for people--!"  "By the way," I asked, "how small a thing will the biggest telescopes show upon the moon?"  "One could see a fair-sized church. One could certainly see any towns or buildings, or anything like the handiwork of men. There might perhaps be insects, something in the way of ants, for example, so that they could hide in deep burrows from the lunar light, or some new sort of creatures having no earthly parallel. That is the most probable thing, if we are to find life there at all. Think of the difference in conditions! Life must fit itself to a day as long as fourteen earthly days, a cloudless sun-blaze of fourteen days, and then a night of equal length, growing ever colder and colder under these, cold, sharp stars. In that night there must be cold, the ultimate cold, absolute zero, 273 degrees Centigrade, below the earthly freezing point. Whatever life there is must hibernate through that, and rise again each day."  He mused. "One can imagine something worm-like," he said, "taking its air solid as an earth-worm swallows earth, or thick-skinned monsters--"  "By the bye," I said, "why didn't we bring a gun?"  He did not answer that question. "No," he concluded, "we just have to go. We shall see when we get there."  I remembered something. "Of course, there's my minerals, anyhow," I said; "whatever the conditions may be."  Presently he told me he wished to alter our course a little by letting the earth tug at us for a moment. He was going to open one earthward blind for thirty seconds. He warned me that it would make my head swim, and advised me to extend my hands against the glass to break my fall. I did as he directed, and thrust my feet against the bales of food cases and air cylinders to prevent their falling upon me. Then with a click the window flew open. I fell clumsily upon hands and face, and saw for a moment between my black extended fingers our mother earth--a planet in a downward sky.  We were still very near--Cavor told me the distance was perhaps eight hundred miles and the huge terrestrial disc filled all heaven. But already it was plain to see that the world was a globe. The land below us was in twilight and vague, but westward the vast gray stretches of the Atlantic shone like molten silver under the receding day. I think I recognised the cloud-dimmed coast-lines of France and Spain and the south of England, and then, with a click, the shutter closed again, and I found myself in a state of extraordinary confusion sliding slowly over the smooth glass.  When at last things settled themselves in my mind again, it seemed quite beyond question that the moon was "down" and under my feet, and that the earth was somewhere away on the level of the horizon--the earth that had been "down" to me and my kindred since the beginning of things.  So slight were the exertions required of us, so easy did the practical annihilation of our weight make all we had to do, that the necessity for taking refreshment did not occur to us for nearly six hours (by Cavor's chronometer) after our start. I was amazed at that lapse of time. Even then I was satisfied with very little. Cavor examined the apparatus for absorbing carbonic acid and water, and pronounced it to be in satisfactory order, our consumption of oxygen having been extraordinarily slight. And our talk being exhausted for the time, and there being nothing further for us to do, we gave way to a curious drowsiness that had come upon us, and spreading our blankets on the bottom of the sphere in such a manner as to shut out most of the moonlight, wished each other good-night, and almost immediately fell asleep.  And so, sleeping, and sometimes talking and reading a little, and at times eating, although without any keenness of appetite,[*] but for the most part in a sort of quiescence that was neither waking nor slumber, we fell through a space of time that had neither night nor day in it, silently, softly, and swiftly down towards the moon.  [* Footnote: It is a curious thing, that while we were in the sphere we felt not the slightest desire for food, nor did we feel the want of it when we abstained. At first we forced our appetites, but afterwards we fasted completely. Altogether we did not consume one-hundredth part of the compressed provisions we had brought with us. The amount of carbonic acid we breathed was also unnaturally low, but why this was, I am quite unable to explain.]      Chapter 6     The Landing on the Moon  I remember how one day Cavor suddenly opened six of our shutters and blinded me so that I cried aloud at him. The whole area was moon, a stupendous scimitar of white dawn with its edge hacked out by notches of darkness, the crescent shore of an ebbing tide of darkness, out of which peaks and pinnacles came glittering into the blaze of the sun. I take it the reader has seen pictures or photographs of the moon and that I need not describe the broader features of that landscape, those spacious ring-like ranges vaster than any terrestrial mountains, their summits shining in the day, their shadows harsh and deep, the gray disordered plains, the ridges, hills, and craterlets, all passing at last from a blazing illumination into a common mystery of black. Athwart this world we were flying scarcely a hundred miles above its crests and pinnacles. And now we could see, what no eye on earth will ever see, that under the blaze of the day the harsh outlines of the rocks and ravines of the plains and crater floor grew gray and indistinct under a thickening haze, that the white of their lit surfaces broke into lumps and patches, and broke again and shrank and vanished, and that here and there strange tints of brown and olive grew and spread.  But little time we had for watching then. For now we had come to the real danger of our journey. We had to drop ever closer to the moon as we spun about it, to slacken our pace and watch our chance, until at last we could dare to drop upon its surface.  For Cavor that was a time of intense exertion; for me it was an anxious inactivity. I seemed perpetually to be getting out of his way. He leapt about the sphere from point to point with an agility that would have been impossible on earth. He was perpetually opening and closing the Cavorite windows, making calculations, consulting his chronometer by means of the glow lamp during those last eventful hours. For a long time we had all our windows closed and hung silently in darkness hurling through space.  Then he was feeling for the shutter studs, and suddenly four windows were open. I staggered and covered my eyes, drenched and scorched and blinded by the unaccustomed splendour of the sun beneath my feet. Then again the shutters snapped, leaving my brain spinning in a darkness that pressed against the eyes. And after that I floated in another vast, black silence.  Then Cavor switched on the electric light, and told me he proposed to bind all our luggage together with the blankets about it, against the concussion of our descent. We did this with our windows closed, because in that way our goods arranged themselves naturally at the centre of the sphere. That too was a strange business; we two men floating loose in that spherical space, and packing and pulling ropes. Imagine it if you can! No up nor down, and every effort resulting in unexpected movements. Now I would be pressed against the glass with the full force of Cavor's thrust, now I would be kicking helplessly in a void. Now the star of the electric light would be overhead, now under foot. Now Cavor's feet would float up before my eyes, and now we would be crossways to each other. But at last our goods were safely bound together in a big soft bale, all except two blankets with head holes that we were to wrap about ourselves.  Then for a flash Cavor opened a window moonward, and we saw that we were dropping towards a huge central crater with a number of minor craters grouped in a sort of cross about it. And then again Cavor flung our little sphere open to the scorching, blinding sun. I think he was using the sun's attraction as a brake. "Cover yourself with a blanket," he cried, thrusting himself from me, and for a moment I did not understand.  Then I hauled the blanket from beneath my feet and got it about me and over my head and eyes. Abruptly he closed the shutters again, snapped one open again and closed it, then suddenly began snapping them all open, each safely into its steel roller. There came a jar, and then we were rolling over and over, bumping against the glass and against the big bale of our luggage, and clutching at each other, and outside some white substance splashed as if we were rolling down a slope of snow....  Over, clutch, bump, clutch, bump, over....  Came a thud, and I was half buried under the bale of our possessions, and for a space everything was still. Then I could hear Cavor puffing and grunting, and the snapping of a shutter in its sash. I made an effort, thrust back our blanket-wrapped luggage, and emerged from beneath it. Our open windows were just visible as a deeper black set with stars.  We were still alive, and we were lying in the darkness of the shadow of the wall of the great crater into which we had fallen.  We sat getting our breath again, and feeling the bruises on our limbs. I don't think either of us had had a very clear expectation of such rough handling as we had received. I struggled painfully to my feet. "And now," said I, "to look at the landscape of the moon! But--! It's tremendously dark, Cavor!"  The glass was dewy, and as I spoke I wiped at it with my blanket. "We're half an hour or so beyond the day," he said. "We must wait."  It was impossible to distinguish anything. We might have been in a sphere of steel for all that we could see. My rubbing with the blanket simply smeared the glass, and as fast as I wiped it, it became opaque again with freshly condensed moisture mixed with an increasing quantity of blanket hairs. Of course I ought not to have used the blanket. In my efforts to clear the glass I slipped upon the damp surface, and hurt my shin against one of the oxygen cylinders that protruded from our bale.  The thing was exasperating--it was absurd. Here we were just arrived upon the moon, amidst we knew not what wonders, and all we could see was the gray and streaming wall of the bubble in which we had come.  "Confound it!" I said, "but at this rate we might have stopped at home;" and I squatted on the bale and shivered, and drew my blanket closer about me.  Abruptly the moisture turned to spangles and fronds of frost. "Can you reach the electric heater," said Cavor. "Yes--that black knob. Or we shall freeze."  I did not wait to be told twice. "And now," said I, "what are we to do?"  "Wait," he said.  "Wait?"  "Of course. We shall have to wait until our air gets warm again, and then this glass will clear. We can't do anything till then. It's night here yet; we must wait for the day to overtake us. Meanwhile, don't you feel hungry?"  For a space I did not answer him, but sat fretting. I turned reluctantly from the smeared puzzle of the glass and stared at his face. "Yes," I said, "I am hungry. I feel somehow enormously disappointed. I had expected--I don't know what I had expected, but not this."  I summoned my philosophy, and rearranging my blanket about me sat down on the bale again and began my first meal on the moon. I don't think I finished it--I forget. Presently, first in patches, then running rapidly together into wider spaces, came the clearing of the glass, came the drawing of the misty veil that hid the moon world from our eyes.  We peered out upon the landscape of the moon.      Chapter 7     Sunrise on the Moon  As we saw it first it was the wildest and most desolate of scenes. We were in an enormous amphitheatre, a vast circular plain, the floor of the giant crater. Its cliff-like walls closed us in on every side. From the westward the light of the unseen sun fell upon them, reaching to the very foot of the cliff, and showed a disordered escarpment of drab and grayish rock, lined here and there with banks and crevices of snow. This was perhaps a dozen miles away, but at first no intervening atmosphere diminished in the slightest the minutely detailed brilliancy with which these things glared at us. They stood out clear and dazzling against a background of starry blackness that seemed to our earthly eyes rather a gloriously spangled velvet curtain than the spaciousness of the sky.  The eastward cliff was at first merely a starless selvedge to the starry dome. No rosy flush, no creeping pallor, announced the commencing day. Only the Corona, the Zodiacal light, a huge cone-shaped, luminous haze, pointing up towards the splendour of the morning star, warned us of the imminent nearness of the sun.  Whatever light was about us was reflected by the westward cliffs. It showed a huge undulating plain, cold and gray, a gray that deepened eastward into the absolute raven darkness of the cliff shadow. Innumerable rounded gray summits, ghostly hummocks, billows of snowy substance, stretching crest beyond crest into the remote obscurity, gave us our first inkling of the distance of the crater wall. These hummocks looked like snow. At the time I thought they were snow. But they were not--they were mounds and masses of frozen air.  So it was at first; and then, sudden, swift, and amazing, came the lunar day.  The sunlight had crept down the cliff, it touched the drifted masses at its base and incontinently came striding with seven-leagued boots towards us. The distant cliff seemed to shift and quiver, and at the touch of the dawn a reek of gray vapour poured upward from the crater floor, whirls and puffs and drifting wraiths of gray, thicker and broader and denser, until at last the whole westward plain was steaming like a wet handkerchief held before the fire, and the westward cliffs were no more than refracted glare beyond.  "It is air," said Cavor. "It must be air--or it would not rise like this--at the mere touch of a sun-beam. And at this pace...."  He peered upwards. "Look!" he said.  "What?" I asked.  "In the sky. Already. On the blackness--a little touch of blue. See! The stars seem larger. And the little ones and all those dim nebulosities we saw in empty space--they are hidden!"  Swiftly, steadily, the day approached us. Gray summit after gray summit was overtaken by the blaze, and turned to a smoking white intensity. At last there was nothing to the west of us but a bank of surging fog, the tumultuous advance and ascent of cloudy haze. The distant cliff had receded farther and farther, had loomed and changed through the whirl, and foundered and vanished at last in its confusion.  Nearer came that steaming advance, nearer and nearer, coming as fast as the shadow of a cloud before the south-west wind. About us rose a thin anticipatory haze.  Cavor gripped my arm. "What?" I said.  "Look! The sunrise! The sun!"  He turned me about and pointed to the brow of the eastward cliff, looming above the haze about us, scarce lighter than the darkness of the sky. But now its line was marked by strange reddish shapes, tongues of vermilion flame that writhed and danced. I fancied it must be spirals of vapour that had caught the light and made this crest of fiery tongues against the sky, but indeed it was the solar prominences I saw, a crown of fire about the sun that is forever hidden from earthly eyes by our atmospheric veil.  And then--the sun!  Steadily, inevitably came a brilliant line, came a thin edge of intolerable effulgence that took a circular shape, became a bow, became a blazing sceptre, and hurled a shaft of heat at us as though it was a spear.  It seemed verily to stab my eyes! I cried aloud and turned about blinded, groping for my blanket beneath the bale.  And with that incandescence came a sound, the first sound that had reached us from without since we left the earth, a hissing and rustling, the stormy trailing of the aerial garment of the advancing day. And with the coming of the sound and the light the sphere lurched, and blinded and dazzled we staggered helplessly against each other. It lurched again, and the hissing grew louder. I had shut my eyes perforce, I was making clumsy efforts to cover my head with my blanket, and this second lurch sent me helplessly off my feet. I fell against the bale, and opening my eyes had a momentary glimpse of the air just outside our glass. It was running--it was boiling--like snow into which a white-hot rod is thrust. What had been solid air had suddenly at the touch of the sun become a paste, a mud, a slushy liquefaction, that hissed and bubbled into gas.  There came a still more violent whirl of the sphere and we had clutched one another. In another moment we were spun about again. Round we went and over, and then I was on all fours. The lunar dawn had hold of us. It meant to show us little men what the moon could do with us.  I caught a second glimpse of things without, puffs of vapour, half liquid slush, excavated, sliding, falling, sliding. We dropped into darkness. I went down with Cavor's knees in my chest. Then he seemed to fly away from me, and for a moment I lay with all the breath out of my body staring upward. A toppling crag of the melting stuff had splashed over us, buried us, and now it thinned and boiled off us. I saw the bubbles dancing on the glass above. I heard Cavor exclaiming feebly.  Then some huge landslip in the thawing air had caught us, and spluttering expostulation, we began to roll down a slope, rolling faster and faster, leaping crevasses and rebounding from banks, faster and faster, westward into the white-hot boiling tumult of the lunar day.  Clutching at one another we spun about, pitched this way and that, our bale of packages leaping at us, pounding at us. We collided, we gripped, we were torn asunder--our heads met, and the whole universe burst into fiery darts and stars! On the earth we should have smashed one another a dozen times, but on the moon, luckily for us, our weight was only one-sixth of what it is terrestrially, and we fell very mercifully. I recall a sensation of utter sickness, a feeling as if my brain were upside down within my skull, and then--  Something was at work upon my face, some thin feelers worried my ears. Then I discovered the brilliance of the landscape around was mitigated by blue spectacles. Cavor bent over me, and I saw his face upside down, his eyes also protected by tinted goggles. His breath came irregularly, and his lip was bleeding from a bruise. "Better?" he said, wiping the blood with the back of his hand.  Everything seemed swaying for a space, but that was simply my giddiness. I perceived that he had closed some of the shutters in the outer sphere to save me--from the direct blaze of the sun. I was aware that everything about us was very brilliant.  "Lord!" I gasped. "But this--"  I craned my neck to see. I perceived there was a blinding glare outside, an utter change from the gloomy darkness of our first impressions. "Have I been insensible long?" I asked.  "I don't know--the chronometer is broken. Some little time.... My dear chap! I have been afraid..."  I lay for a space taking this in. I saw his face still bore evidences of emotion. For a while I said nothing. I passed an inquisitive hand over my contusions, and surveyed his face for similar damages. The back of my right hand had suffered most, and was skinless and raw. My forehead was bruised and had bled. He handed me a little measure with some of the restorative--I forget the name of it--he had brought with us. After a time I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs carefully. Soon I could talk.  "It wouldn't have done," I said, as though there had been no interval.  "No! it _wouldn't_."  He thought, his hands hanging over his knees. He peered through the glass and then stared at me.  "Good Lord!" he said. "No!"  "What has happened?" I asked after a pause. "Have we jumped to the tropics?"  "It was as I expected. This air has evaporated--if it is air. At any rate, it has evaporated, and the surface of the moon is showing. We are lying on a bank of earthy rock. Here and there bare soil is exposed. A queer sort of soil!"  It occurred to him that it was unnecessary to explain. He assisted me into a sitting position, and I could see with my own eyes.      Chapter 8     A Lunar Morning  The harsh emphasis, the pitiless black and white of scenery had altogether disappeared. The glare of the sun had taken upon itself a faint tinge of amber; the shadows upon the cliff of the crater wall were deeply purple. To the eastward a dark bank of fog still crouched and sheltered from the sunrise, but to the westward the sky was blue and clear. I began to realise the length of my insensibility.  We were no longer in a void. An atmosphere had arisen about us. The outline of things had gained in character, had grown acute and varied; save for a shadowed space of white substance here and there, white substance that was no longer air but snow, the arctic appearance had gone altogether. Everywhere broad rusty brown spaces of bare and tumbled earth spread to the blaze of the sun. Here and there at the edge of the snowdrifts were transient little pools and eddies of water, the only things stirring in that expanse of barrenness. The sunlight inundated the upper two blinds of our sphere and turned our climate to high summer, but our feet were still in shadow, and the sphere was lying upon a drift of snow.  And scattered here and there upon the slope, and emphasised by little white threads of unthawed snow upon their shady sides, were shapes like sticks, dry twisted sticks of the same rusty hue as the rock upon which they lay. That caught one's thoughts sharply. Sticks! On a lifeless world? Then as my eye grew more accustomed to the texture of their substance, I perceived that almost all this surface had a fibrous texture, like the carpet of brown needles one finds beneath the shade of pine trees.  "Cavor!" I said.  "Yes."  "It may be a dead world now--but once--"  Something arrested my attention. I had discovered among these needles a number of little round objects. And it seemed to me that one of these had moved. "Cavor," I whispered.  "What?"  But I did not answer at once. I stared incredulous. For an instant I could not believe my eyes. I gave an inarticulate cry. I gripped his arm. I pointed. "Look!" I cried, finding my tongue. "There! Yes! And there!"  His eyes followed my pointing finger. "Eh?" he said.  How can I describe the thing I saw? It is so petty a thing to state, and yet it seemed so wonderful, so pregnant with emotion. I have said that amidst the stick-like litter were these rounded bodies, these little oval bodies that might have passed as very small pebbles. And now first one and then another had stirred, had rolled over and cracked, and down the crack of each of them showed a minute line of yellowish green, thrusting outward to meet the hot encouragement of the newly-risen sun. For a moment that was all, and then there stirred, and burst a third!  "It is a seed," said Cavor. And then I heard him whisper very softly, "Life!"  "Life!" And immediately it poured upon us that our vast journey had not been made in vain, that we had come to no arid waste of minerals, but to a world that lived and moved! We watched intensely. I remember I kept rubbing the glass before me with my sleeve, jealous of the faintest suspicion of mist.  The picture was clear and vivid only in the middle of the field. All about that centre the dead fibres and seeds were magnified and distorted by the curvature of the glass. But we could see enough! One after another all down the sunlit slope these miraculous little brown bodies burst and gaped apart, like seed-pods, like the husks of fruits; opened eager mouths. that drank in the heat and light pouring in a cascade from the newly-risen sun.  Every moment more of these seed coats ruptured, and even as they did so the swelling pioneers overflowed their rent-distended seed-cases, and passed into the second stage of growth. With a steady assurance, a swift deliberation, these amazing seeds thrust a rootlet downward to the earth and a queer little bundle-like bud into the air. In a little while the whole slope was dotted with minute plantlets standing at attention in the blaze of the sun.  They did not stand for long. The bundle-like buds swelled and strained and opened with a jerk, thrusting out a coronet of little sharp tips, spreading a whorl of tiny, spiky, brownish leaves, that lengthened rapidly, lengthened visibly even as we watched. The movement was slower than any animal's, swifter than any plant's I have ever seen before. How can I suggest it to you--the way that growth went on? The leaf tips grew so that they moved onward even while we looked at them. The brown seed-case shrivelled and was absorbed with an equal rapidity. Have you ever on a cold day taken a thermometer into your warm hand and watched the little thread of mercury creep up the tube? These moon plants grew like that.  In a few minutes, as it seemed, the buds of the more forward of these plants had lengthened into a stem and were even putting forth a second whorl of leaves, and all the slope that had seemed so recently a lifeless stretch of litter was now dark with the stunted olive-green herbage of bristling spikes that swayed with the vigour of their growing.  I turned about, and behold! along the upper edge of a rock to the eastward a similar fringe in a scarcely less forward condition swayed and bent, dark against the blinding glare of the sun. And beyond this fringe was the silhouette of a plant mass, branching clumsily like a cactus, and swelling visibly, swelling like a bladder that fills with air.  Then to the westward also I discovered that another such distended form was rising over the scrub. But here the light fell upon its sleek sides, and I could see that its colour was a vivid orange hue. It rose as one watched it; if one looked away from it for a minute and then back, its outline had changed; it thrust out blunt congested branches until in a little time it rose a coralline shape of many feet in height. Compared with such a growth the terrestrial puff-ball, which will sometimes swell a foot in diameter in a single night, would be a hopeless laggard. But then the puff-ball grows against a gravitational pull six times that of the moon. Beyond, out of gullies and flats that had been hidden from us, but not from the quickening sun, over reefs and banks of shining rock, a bristling beard of spiky and fleshy vegetation was straining into view, hurrying tumultuously to take advantage of the brief day in which it must flower and fruit and seed again and die. It was like a miracle, that growth. So, one must imagine, the trees and plants arose at the Creation and covered the desolation of the new-made earth.  Imagine it! Imagine that dawn! The resurrection of the frozen air, the stirring and quickening of the soil, and then this silent uprising of vegetation, this unearthly ascent of fleshiness and spikes. Conceive it all lit by a blaze that would make the intensest sunlight of earth seem watery and weak. And still around this stirring jungle, wherever there was shadow, lingered banks of bluish snow. And to have the picture of our impression complete, you must bear in mind that we saw it all through a thick bent glass, distorting it as things are distorted by a lens, acute only in the centre of the picture, and very bright there, and towards the edges magnified and unreal.      Chapter 9     Prospecting Begins  We ceased to gaze. We turned to each other, the same thought, the same question in our eyes. For these plants to grow, there must be some air, however attenuated, air that we also should be able to breathe.  "The manhole?" I said.  "Yes!" said Cavor, "if it is air we see!"  "In a little while," I said, "these plants will be as high as we are. Suppose--suppose after all-- Is it certain? How do you know that stuff _is_ air? It may be nitrogen--it may be carbonic acid even!"  "That's easy," he said, and set about proving it. He produced a big piece of crumpled paper from the bale, lit it, and thrust it hastily through the man-hole valve. I bent forward and peered down through the thick glass for its appearance outside, that little flame on whose evidence depended so much!  I saw the paper drop out and lie lightly upon the snow. The pink flame of its burning vanished. For an instant it seemed to be extinguished. And then I saw a little blue tongue upon the edge of it that trembled, and crept, and spread!  Quietly the whole sheet, save where it lay in immediate contact with the snow, charred and shrivelled and sent up a quivering thread of smoke. There was no doubt left to me; the atmosphere of the moon was either pure oxygen or air, and capable therefore--unless its tenuity was excessive--of supporting our alien life. We might emerge--and live!  I sat down with my legs on either side of the manhole and prepared to unscrew it, but Cavor stopped me. "There is first a little precaution," he said. He pointed out that although it was certainly an oxygenated atmosphere outside, it might still be so rarefied as to cause us grave injury. He reminded me of mountain sickness, and of the bleeding that often afflicts aeronauts who have ascended too swiftly, and he spent some time in the preparation of a sickly-tasting drink which he insisted on my sharing. It made me feel a little numb, but otherwise had no effect on me. Then he permitted me to begin unscrewing.  Presently the glass stopper of the manhole was so far undone that the denser air within our sphere began to escape along the thread of the screw, singing as a kettle sings before it boils. Thereupon he made me desist. It speedily became evident that the pressure outside was very much less than it was within. How much less it was we had no means of telling.  I sat grasping the stopper with both hands, ready to close it again if, in spite of our intense hope, the lunar atmosphere should after all prove too rarefied for us, and Cavor sat with a cylinder of compressed oxygen at hand to restore our pressure. We looked at one another in silence, and then at the fantastic vegetation that swayed and grew visibly and noiselessly without. And ever that shrill piping continued.  My blood-vessels began to throb in my ears, and the sound of Cavor's movements diminished. I noted how still everything had become, because of the thinning of the air.  As our air sizzled out from the screw the moisture of it condensed in little puffs.  Presently I experienced a peculiar shortness of breath that lasted indeed during the whole of the time of our exposure to the moon's exterior atmosphere, and a rather unpleasant sensation about the ears and finger-nails and the back of the throat grew upon my attention, and presently passed off again.  But then came vertigo and nausea that abruptly changed the quality of my courage. I gave the lid of the manhole half a turn and made a hasty explanation to Cavor; but now he was the more sanguine. He answered me in a voice that seemed extraordinarily small and remote, because of the thinness of the air that carried the sound. He recommended a nip of brandy, and set me the example, and presently I felt better. I turned the manhole stopper back again. The throbbing in my ears grew louder, and then I remarked that the piping note of the outrush had ceased. For a time I could not be sure that it had ceased.  "Well?" said Cavor, in the ghost of a voice.  "Well?" said I.  "Shall we go on?"  I thought. "Is this all?"  "If you can stand it."  By way of answer I went on unscrewing. I lifted the circular operculum from its place and laid it carefully on the bale. A flake or so of snow whirled and vanished as that thin and unfamiliar air took possession of our sphere. I knelt, and then seated myself at the edge of the manhole, peering over it. Beneath, within a yard of my face, lay the untrodden snow of the moon.  There came a little pause. Our eyes met.  "It doesn't distress your lungs too much?" said Cavor.  "No," I said. "I can stand this."  He stretched out his hand for his blanket, thrust his head through its central hole, and wrapped it about him. He sat down on the edge of the manhole, he let his feet drop until they were within six inches of the lunar ground. He hesitated for a moment, then thrust himself forward, dropped these intervening inches, and stood upon the untrodden soil of the moon.  As he stepped forward he was refracted grotesquely by the edge of the glass. He stood for a moment looking this way and that. Then he drew himself together and leapt.  The glass distorted everything, but it seemed to me even then to be an extremely big leap. He had at one bound become remote. He seemed twenty or thirty feet off. He was standing high upon a rocky mass and gesticulating back to me. Perhaps he was shouting--but the sound did not reach me. But how the deuce had he done this? I felt like a man who has just seen a new conjuring trick.  In a puzzled state of mind I too dropped through the manhole. I stood up. Just in front of me the snowdrift had fallen away and made a sort of ditch. I made a step and jumped.  I found myself flying through the air, saw the rock on which he stood coming to meet me, clutched it and clung in a state of infinite amazement.  I gasped a painful laugh. I was tremendously confused. Cavor bent down and shouted in piping tones for me to be careful.  I had forgotten that on the moon, with only an eighth part of the earth's mass and a quarter of its diameter, my weight was barely a sixth what it was on earth. But now that fact insisted on being remembered.  "We are out of Mother Earth's leading-strings now," he said.  With a guarded effort I raised myself to the top, and moving as cautiously as a rheumatic patient, stood up beside him under the blaze of the sun. The sphere lay behind us on its dwindling snowdrift thirty feet away.  As far as the eye could see over the enormous disorder of rocks that formed the crater floor, the same bristling scrub that surrounded us was starting into life, diversified here and there by bulging masses of a cactus form, and scarlet and purple lichens that grew so fast they seemed to crawl over the rocks. The whole area of the crater seemed to me then to be one similar wilderness up to the very foot of the surrounding cliff.  This cliff was apparently bare of vegetation save at its base, and with buttresses and terraces and platforms that did not very greatly attract our attention at the time. It was many miles away from us in every direction; we seemed to be almost at the centre of the crater, and we saw it through a certain haziness that drove before the wind. For there was even a wind now in the thin air, a swift yet weak wind that chilled exceedingly but exerted little pressure. It was blowing round the crater, as it seemed, to the hot illuminated side from the foggy darkness under the sunward wall. It was difficult to look into this eastward fog; we had to peer with half-closed eyes beneath the shade of our hands, because of the fierce intensity of the motionless sun.  "It seems to be deserted," said Cavor, "absolutely desolate."  I looked about me again. I retained even then a clinging hope of some quasi-human evidence, some pinnacle of building, some house or engine, but everywhere one looked spread the tumbled rocks in peaks and crests, and the darting scrub and those bulging cacti that swelled and swelled, a flat negation as it seemed of all such hope.  "It looks as though these plants had it to themselves," I said. "I see no trace of any other creature."  "No insects--no birds, no! Not a trace, not a scrap nor particle of animal life. If there was--what would they do in the night? ... No; there's just these plants alone."  I shaded my eyes with my hand. "It's like the landscape of a dream. These things are less like earthly land plants than the things one imagines among the rocks at the bottom of the sea. Look at that yonder! One might imagine it a lizard changed into a plant. And the glare!"  "This is only the fresh morning," said Cavor.  He sighed and looked about him. "This is no world for men," he said. "And yet in a way--it appeals."  He became silent for a time, then commenced his meditative humming.  I started at a gentle touch, and found a thin sheet of livid lichen lapping over my shoe. I kicked at it and it fell to powder, and each speck began to grow.  I heard Cavor exclaim sharply, and perceived that one of the fixed bayonets of the scrub had pricked him. He hesitated, his eyes sought among the rocks about us. A sudden blaze of pink had crept up a ragged pillar of crag. It was a most extraordinary pink, a livid magenta.  "Look!" said I, turning, and behold Cavor had vanished.  For an instant I stood transfixed. Then I made a hasty step to look over the verge of the rock. But in my surprise at his disappearance I forgot once more that we were on the moon. The thrust of my foot that I made in striding would have carried me a yard on earth; on the moon it carried me six--a good five yards over the edge. For the moment the thing had something of the effect of those nightmares when one falls and falls. For while one falls sixteen feet in the first second of a fall on earth, on the moon one falls two, and with only a sixth of one's weight. I fell, or rather I jumped down, about ten yards I suppose. It seemed to take quite a long time, five or six seconds, I should think. I floated through the air and fell like a feather, knee-deep in a snow-drift in the bottom of a gully of blue-gray, white-veined rock.  I looked about me. "Cavor!" I cried; but no Cavor was visible.  "Cavor!" I cried louder, and the rocks echoed me.  I turned fiercely to the rocks and clambered to the summit of them. "Cavor!" I cried. My voice sounded like the voice of a lost lamb.  The sphere, too, was not in sight, and for a moment a horrible feeling of desolation pinched my heart.  Then I saw him. He was laughing and gesticulating to attract my attention. He was on a bare patch of rock twenty or thirty yards away. I could not hear his voice, but "jump" said his gestures. I hesitated, the distance seemed enormous. Yet I reflected that surely I must be able to clear a greater distance than Cavor.  I made a step back, gathered myself together, and leapt with all my might. I seemed to shoot right up in the air as though I should never come down.  It was horrible and delightful, and as wild as a nightmare, to go flying off in this fashion. I realised my leap had been altogether too violent. I flew clean over Cavor's head and beheld a spiky confusion in a gully spreading to meet my fall. I gave a yelp of alarm. I put out my hands and straightened my legs.  I hit a huge fungoid bulk that burst all about me, scattering a mass of orange spores in every direction, and covering me with orange powder. I rolled over spluttering, and came to rest convulsed with breathless laughter.  I became aware of Cavor's little round face peering over a bristling hedge. He shouted some faded inquiry. "Eh?" I tried to shout, but could not do so for want of breath. He made his way towards me, coming gingerly among the bushes.  "We've got to be careful," he said. "This moon has no discipline. She'll let us smash ourselves."  He helped me to my feet. "You exerted yourself too much," he said, dabbing at the yellow stuff with his hand to remove it from my garments.  I stood passive and panting, allowing him to beat off the jelly from my knees and elbows and lecture me upon my misfortunes. "We don't quite allow for the gravitation. Our muscles are scarcely educated yet. We must practise a little, when you have got your breath."  I pulled two or three little thorns out of my hand, and sat for a time on a boulder of rock. My muscles were quivering, and I had that feeling of personal disillusionment that comes at the first fall to the learner of cycling on earth.  It suddenly occurred to Cavor that the cold air in the gully, after the brightness of the sun, might give me a fever. So we clambered back into the sunlight. We found that beyond a few abrasions I had received no serious injuries from my tumble, and at Cavor's suggestion we were presently looking round for some safe and easy landing-place for my next leap. We chose a rocky slab some ten yards off, separated from us by a little thicket of olive-green spikes.  "Imagine it there!" said Cavor, who was assuming the airs of a trainer, and he pointed to a spot about four feet from my toes. This leap I managed without difficulty, and I must confess I found a certain satisfaction in Cavor's falling short by a foot or so and tasting the spikes of the scrub. "One has to be careful you see," he said, pulling out his thorns, and with that he ceased to be my mentor and became my fellow-learner in the art of lunar locomotion.  We chose a still easier jump and did it without difficulty, and then leapt back again, and to and fro several times, accustoming our muscles to the new standard. I could never have believed had I not experienced it, how rapid that adaptation would be. In a very little time indeed, certainly after fewer than thirty leaps, we could judge the effort necessary for a distance with almost terrestrial assurance.  And all this time the lunar plants were growing around us, higher and denser and more entangled, every moment thicker and taller, spiked plants, green cactus masses, fungi, fleshy and lichenous things, strangest radiate and sinuous shapes. But we were so intent upon our leaping, that for a time we gave no heed to their unfaltering expansion.  An extraordinary elation had taken possession of us. Partly, I think, it was our sense of release from the confinement of the sphere. Mainly, however, the thin sweetness of the air, which I am certain contained a much larger proportion of oxygen than our terrestrial atmosphere. In spite of the strange quality of all about us, I felt as adventurous and experimental as a cockney would do placed for the first time among mountains and I do not think it occurred to either of us, face to face though we were with the unknown, to be very greatly afraid.  We were bitten by a spirit of enterprise. We selected a lichenous kopje perhaps fifteen yards away, and landed neatly on its summit one after the other. "Good!" we cried to each other; "good!" and Cavor made three steps and went off to a tempting slope of snow a good twenty yards and more beyond. I stood for a moment struck by the grotesque effect of his soaring figure--his dirty cricket cap, and spiky hair, his little round body, his arms and his knicker-bockered legs tucked up tightly--against the weird spaciousness of the lunar scene. A gust of laughter seized me, and then I stepped off to follow. Plump! I dropped beside him.  We made a few gargantuan strides, leapt three or four times more, and sat down at last in a lichenous hollow. Our lungs were painful. We sat holding our sides and recovering our breath, looking appreciation to one another. Cavor panted something about "amazing sensations." And then came a thought into my head. For the moment it did not seem a particularly appalling thought, simply a natural question arising out of the situation.  "By the way," I said, "where exactly is the sphere?"  Cavor looked at me. "Eh?"  The full meaning of what we were saying struck me sharply.  "Cavor!" I cried, laying a hand on his arm, "where is the sphere?"      Chapter 10     Lost Men in the Moon  His face caught something of my dismay. He stood up and stared about him at the scrub that fenced us in and rose about us, straining upward in a passion of growth. He put a dubious hand to his lips. He spoke with a sudden lack of assurance. "I think," he said slowly, "we left it ... somewhere ... about _there_."  He pointed a hesitating finger that wavered in an arc.  "I'm not sure." His look of consternation deepened. "Anyhow," he said, with his eyes on me, "it can't be far."  We had both stood up. We made unmeaning ejaculations, our eyes sought in the twining, thickening jungle round about us.  All about us on the sunlit slopes frothed and swayed the darting shrubs, the swelling cactus, the creeping lichens, and wherever the shade remained the snow-drifts lingered. North, south, east, and west spread an identical monotony of unfamiliar forms. And somewhere, buried already among this tangled confusion, was our sphere, our home, our only provision, our only hope of escape from this fantastic wilderness of ephemeral growths into which we had come.  "I think after all," he said, pointing suddenly, "it might be over there."  "No," I said. "We have turned in a curve. See! here is the mark of my heels. It's clear the thing must be more to the eastward, much more. No--the sphere must be over there."  "I _think_," said Cavor, "I kept the sun upon my right all the time."  "Every leap, it seems to me," I said, "my shadow flew before me."  We stared into one another's eyes. The area of the crater had become enormously vast to our imaginations, the growing thickets already impenetrably dense.  "Good heavens! What fools we have been!"  "It's evident that we must find it again," said Cavor, "and that soon. The sun grows stronger. We should be fainting with the heat already if it wasn't so dry. And ... I'm hungry."  I stared at him. I had not suspected this aspect of the matter before. But it came to me at once--a positive craving. "Yes," I said with emphasis. "I am hungry too."  He stood up with a look of active resolution. "Certainly we must find the sphere."  As calmly as possible we surveyed the interminable reefs and thickets that formed the floor of the crater, each of us weighing in silence the chances of our finding the sphere before we were overtaken by heat and hunger.  "It can't be fifty yards from here," said Cavor, with indecisive gestures. "The only thing is to beat round about until we come upon it."  "That is all we can do," I said, without any alacrity to begin our hunt. "I wish this confounded spike bush did not grow so fast!"  "That's just it," said Cavor. "But it was lying on a bank of snow."  I stared about me in the vain hope of recognising some knoll or shrub that had been near the sphere. But everywhere was a confusing sameness, everywhere the aspiring bushes, the distending fungi, the dwindling snow banks, steadily and inevitably changed. The sun scorched and stung, the faintness of an unaccountable hunger mingled with our infinite perplexity. And even as we stood there, confused and lost amidst unprecedented things, we became aware for the first time of a sound upon the moon other than the air of the growing plants, the faint sighing of the wind, or those that we ourselves had made.  Boom.... Boom.... Boom.  It came from beneath our feet, a sound in the earth. We seemed to hear it with our feet as much as with our ears. Its dull resonance was muffled by distance, thick with the quality of intervening substance. No sound that I can imagine could have astonished us more, or have changed more completely the quality of things about us. For this sound, rich, slow, and deliberate, seemed to us as though it could be nothing but the striking of some gigantic buried clock.  Boom.... Boom.... Boom.  Sound suggestive of still cloisters, of sleepless nights in crowded cities, of vigils and the awaited hour, of all that is orderly and methodical in life, booming out pregnant and mysterious in this fantastic desert! To the eye everything was unchanged: the desolation of bushes and cacti waving silently in the wind, stretched unbroken to the distant cliffs, the still dark sky was empty overhead, and the hot sun hung and burned. And through it all, a warning, a threat, throbbed this enigma of sound.  Boom.... Boom.... Boom....  We questioned one another in faint and faded voices.  "A clock?"  "Like a clock!"  "What is it?"  "What can it be?"  "Count," was Cavor's belated suggestion, and at that word the striking ceased.  The silence, the rhythmic disappointment of the silence, came as a fresh shock. For a moment one could doubt whether one had ever heard a sound. Or whether it might not still be going on. Had I indeed heard a sound?  I felt the pressure of Cavor's hand upon my arm. He spoke in an undertone, as though he feared to wake some sleeping thing. "Let us keep together," he whispered, "and look for the sphere. We must get back to the sphere. This is beyond our understanding."  "Which way shall we go?"  He hesitated. An intense persuasion of presences, of unseen things about us and near us, dominated our minds. What could they be? Where could they be? Was this arid desolation, alternately frozen and scorched, only the outer rind and mask of some subterranean world? And if so, what sort of world? What sort of inhabitants might it not presently disgorge upon us?  And then, stabbing the aching stillness as vivid and sudden as an unexpected thunderclap, came a clang and rattle as though great gates of metal had suddenly been flung apart.  It arrested our steps. We stood gaping helplessly. Then Cavor stole towards me.  "I do not understand!" he whispered close to my face. He waved his hand vaguely skyward, the vague suggestion of still vaguer thoughts.  "A hiding-place! If anything came..."  I looked about us. I nodded my head in assent to him.  We started off, moving stealthily with the most exaggerated precautions against noise. We went towards a thicket of scrub. A clangour like hammers flung about a boiler hastened our steps. "We must crawl," whispered Cavor.  The lower leaves of the bayonet plants, already overshadowed by the newer ones above, were beginning to wilt and shrivel so that we could thrust our way in among the thickening stems without serious injury. A stab in the face or arm we did not heed. At the heart of the thicket I stopped, and stared panting into Cavor's face.  "Subterranean," he whispered. "Below."  "They may come out."  "We must find the sphere!"  "Yes," I said; "but how?"  "Crawl till we come to it."  "But if we don't?"  "Keep hidden. See what they are like."  "We will keep together," said I.  He thought. "Which way shall we go?"  "We must take our chance."  We peered this way and that. Then very circumspectly, we began to crawl through the lower jungle, making, so far as we could judge, a circuit, halting now at every waving fungus, at every sound, intent only on the sphere from which we had so foolishly emerged. Ever and again from out of the earth beneath us came concussions, beatings, strange, inexplicable, mechanical sounds; and once, and then again, we thought we heard something, a faint rattle and tumult, borne to us through the air. But fearful as we were we dared essay no vantage-point to survey the crater. For long we saw nothing of the beings whose sounds were so abundant and insistent. But for the faintness of our hunger and the drying of our throats that crawling would have had the quality of a very vivid dream. It was so absolutely unreal. The only element with any touch of reality was these sounds.  Picture it to yourself! About us the dream-like jungle, with the silent bayonet leaves darting overhead, and the silent, vivid, sun-splashed lichens under our hands and knees, waving with the vigour of their growth as a carpet waves when the wind gets beneath it. Ever and again one of the bladder fungi, bulging and distending under the sun, loomed upon us. Ever and again some novel shape in vivid colour obtruded. The very cells that built up these plants were as large as my thumb, like beads of coloured glass. And all these things were saturated in the unmitigated glare of the sun, were seen against a sky that was bluish black and spangled still, in spite of the sunlight, with a few surviving stars. Strange! the very forms and texture of the stones were strange. It was all strange, the feeling of one's body was unprecedented, every other movement ended in a surprise. The breath sucked thin in one's throat, the blood flowed through one's ears in a throbbing tide--thud, thud, thud, thud....  And ever and again came gusts of turmoil, hammering, the clanging and throb of machinery, and presently--the bellowing of great beasts!      Chapter 11     The Mooncalf Pastures  So we two poor terrestrial castaways, lost in that wild-growing moon jungle, crawled in terror before the sounds that had come upon us. We crawled, as it seemed, a long time before we saw either Selenite or mooncalf, though we heard the bellowing and gruntulous noises of these latter continually drawing nearer to us. We crawled through stony ravines, over snow slopes, amidst fungi that ripped like thin bladders at our thrust, emitting a watery humour, over a perfect pavement of things like puff-balls, and beneath interminable thickets of scrub. And ever more helplessly our eyes sought for our abandoned sphere. The noise of the mooncalves would at times be a vast flat calf-like sound, at times it rose to an amazed and wrathy bellowing, and again it would become a clogged bestial sound, as though these unseen creatures had sought to eat and bellow at the same time.  Our first view was but an inadequate transitory glimpse, yet none the less disturbing because it was incomplete. Cavor was crawling in front at the time, and he first was aware of their proximity. He stopped dead, arresting me with a single gesture.  A crackling and smashing of the scrub appeared to be advancing directly upon us, and then, as we squatted close and endeavoured to judge of the nearness and direction of this noise, there came a terrific bellow behind us, so close and vehement that the tops of the bayonet scrub bent before it, and one felt the breath of it hot and moist. And, turning about, we saw indistinctly through a crowd of swaying stems the mooncalf's shining sides, and the long line of its back loomed out against the sky.  Of course it is hard for me now to say how much I saw at that time, because my impressions were corrected by subsequent observation. First of all impressions was its enormous size; the girth of its body was some fourscore feet, its length perhaps two hundred. Its sides rose and fell with its laboured breathing. I perceived that its gigantic, flabby body lay along the ground, and that its skin was of a corrugated white, dappling into blackness along the backbone. But of its feet we saw nothing. I think also that we saw then the profile at least of the almost brainless head, with its fat-encumbered neck, its slobbering omnivorous mouth, its little nostrils, and tight shut eyes. (For the mooncalf invariably shuts its eyes in the presence of the sun.) We had a glimpse of a vast red pit as it opened its mouth to bleat and bellow again; we had a breath from the pit, and then the monster heeled over like a ship, dragged forward along the ground, creasing all its leathery skin, rolled again, and so wallowed past us, smashing a path amidst the scrub, and was speedily hidden from our eyes by the dense interlacings beyond. Another appeared more distantly, and then another, and then, as though he was guiding these animated lumps of provender to their pasture, a Selenite came momentarily into ken. My grip upon Cavor's foot became convulsive at the sight of him, and we remained motionless and peering long after he had passed out of our range.  By contrast with the mooncalves he seemed a trivial being, a mere ant, scarcely five feet high. He was wearing garments of some leathery substance, so that no portion of his actual body appeared, but of this, of course, we were entirely ignorant. He presented himself, therefore, as a compact, bristling creature, having much of the quality of a complicated insect, with whip-like tentacles and a clanging arm projecting from his shining cylindrical body case. The form of his head was hidden by his enormous many-spiked helmet--we discovered afterwards that he used the spikes for prodding refractory mooncalves--and a pair of goggles of darkened glass, set very much at the side, gave a bird-like quality to the metallic apparatus that covered his face. His arms did not project beyond his body case, and he carried himself upon short legs that, wrapped though they were in warm coverings, seemed to our terrestrial eyes inordinately flimsy. They had very short thighs, very long shanks, and little feet.  In spite of his heavy-looking clothing, he was progressing with what would be, from the terrestrial point of view, very considerable strides, and his clanging arm was busy. The quality of his motion during the instant of his passing suggested haste and a certain anger, and soon after we had lost sight of him we heard the bellow of a mooncalf change abruptly into a short, sharp squeal followed by the scuffle of its acceleration. And gradually that bellowing receded, and then came to an end, as if the pastures sought had been attained.  We listened. For a space the moon world was still. But it was some time before we resumed our crawling search for the vanished sphere.  When next we saw mooncalves they were some little distance away from us in a place of tumbled rocks. The less vertical surfaces of the rocks were thick with a speckled green plant growing in dense mossy clumps, upon which these creatures were browsing. We stopped at the edge of the reeds amidst which we were crawling at the sight of them, peering out at then and looking round for a second glimpse of a Selenite. They lay against their food like stupendous slugs, huge, greasy hulls, eating greedily and noisily, with a sort of sobbing avidity. They seemed monsters of mere fatness, clumsy and overwhelmed to a degree that would make a Smithfield ox seem a model of agility. Their busy, writhing, chewing mouths, and eyes closed, together with the appetising sound of their munching, made up an effect of animal enjoyment that was singularly stimulating to our empty frames.  "Hogs!" said Cavor, with unusual passion. "Disgusting hogs!" and after one glare of angry envy crawled off through the bushes to our right. I stayed long enough to see that the speckled plant was quite hopeless for human nourishment, then crawled after him, nibbling a quill of it between my teeth.  Presently we were arrested again by the proximity of a Selenite, and this time we were able to observe him more exactly. Now we could see that the Selenite covering was indeed clothing, and not a sort of crustacean integument. He was quite similar in his costume to the former one we had glimpsed, except that ends of something like wadding were protruding from his neck, and he stood on a promontory of rock and moved his head this way and that, as though he was surveying the crater. We lay quite still, fearing to attract his attention if we moved, and after a time he turned about and disappeared.  We came upon another drove of mooncalves bellowing up a ravine, and then we passed over a place of sounds, sounds of beating machinery as if some huge hall of industry came near the surface there. And while these sounds were still about us we came to the edge of a great open space, perhaps two hundred yards in diameter, and perfectly level. Save for a few lichens that advanced from its margin this space was bare, and presented a powdery surface of a dusty yellow colour. We were afraid to strike out across this space, but as it presented less obstruction to our crawling than the scrub, we went down upon it and began very circumspectly to skirt its edge.  For a little while the noises from below ceased and everything, save for the faint stir of the growing vegetation, was very still. Then abruptly there began an uproar, louder, more vehement, and nearer than any we had so far heard. Of a certainty it came from below. Instinctively we crouched as flat as we could, ready for a prompt plunge into the thicket beside us. Each knock and throb seemed to vibrate through our bodies. Louder grew this throbbing and beating, and that irregular vibration increased until the whole moon world seemed to be jerking and pulsing.  "Cover," whispered Cavor, and I turned towards the bushes.  At that instant came a thud like the thud of a gun, and then a thing happened--it still haunts me in my dreams. I had turned my head to look at Cavor's face, and thrust out my hand in front of me as I did so. And my hand met nothing! I plunged suddenly into a bottomless hole!  My chest hit something hard, and I found myself with my chin on the edge of an unfathomable abyss that had suddenly opened beneath me, my hand extended stiffly into the void. The whole of that flat circular area was no more than a gigantic lid, that was now sliding sideways from off the pit it had covered into a slot prepared for it.  Had it not been for Cavor I think I should have remained rigid, hanging over this margin and staring into the enormous gulf below, until at last the edges of the slot scraped me off and hurled me into its depths. But Cavor had not received the shock that had paralysed me. He had been a little distance from the edge when the lid had first opened, and perceiving the peril that held me helpless, gripped my legs and pulled me backward. I came into a sitting position, crawled away from the edge for a space on all fours, then staggered up and ran after him across the thundering, quivering sheet of metal. It seemed to be swinging open with a steadily accelerated velocity, and the bushes in front of me shifted sideways as I ran.  I was none too soon. Cavor's back vanished amidst the bristling thicket, and as I scrambled up after him, the monstrous valve came into its position with a clang. For a long time we lay panting, not daring to approach the pit.  But at last very cautiously and bit by bit we crept into a position from which we could peer down. The bushes about us creaked and waved with the force of a breeze that was blowing down the shaft. We could see nothing at first except smooth vertical walls descending at last into an impenetrable black. And then very gradually we became aware of a number of very faint and little lights going to and fro.  For a time that stupendous gulf of mystery held us so that we forgot even our sphere. In time, as we grew more accustomed to the darkness, we could make out very small, dim, elusive shapes moving about among those needle-point illuminations. We peered amazed and incredulous, understanding so little that we could find no words to say. We could distinguish nothing that would give us a clue to the meaning of the faint shapes we saw.  "What can it be?" I asked; "what can it be?"  "The engineering!... They must live in these caverns during the night, and come out during the day."  "Cavor!" I said. "Can they be--that--it was something like--men?"  "_That_ was not a man."  "We dare risk nothing!"  "We dare do nothing until we find the sphere!"  "We _can_ do nothing until we find the sphere."  He assented with a groan and stirred himself to move. He stared about him for a space, sighed, and indicated a direction. We struck out through the jungle. For a time we crawled resolutely, then with diminishing vigour. Presently among great shapes of flabby purple there came a noise of trampling and cries about us. We lay close, and for a long time the sounds went to and fro and very near. But this time we saw nothing. I tried to whisper to Cavor that I could hardly go without food much longer, but my mouth had become too dry for whispering.  "Cavor," I said, "I must have food."  He turned a face full of dismay towards me. "It's a case for holding out," he said.  "But I _must_," I said, "and look at my lips!"  "I've been thirsty some time."  "If only some of that snow had remained!"  "It's clean gone! We're driving from arctic to tropical at the rate of a degree a minute...."  I gnawed my hand.  "The sphere!" he said. "There is nothing for it but the sphere."  We roused ourselves to another spurt of crawling. My mind ran entirely on edible things, on the hissing profundity of summer drinks, more particularly I craved for beer. I was haunted by the memory of a sixteen gallon cask that had swaggered in my Lympne cellar. I thought of the adjacent larder, and especially of steak and kidney pie--tender steak and plenty of kidney, and rich, thick gravy between. Ever and again I was seized with fits of hungry yawning. We came to flat places overgrown with fleshy red things, monstrous coralline growths; as we pushed against them they snapped and broke. I noted the quality of the broken surfaces. The confounded stuff certainly looked of a biteable texture. Then it seemed to me that it smelt rather well.  I picked up a fragment and sniffed at it.  "Cavor," I said in a hoarse undertone.  He glanced at me with his face screwed up. "Don't," he said. I put down the fragment, and we crawled on through this tempting fleshiness for a space.  "Cavor," I asked, "why not?"  "Poison," I heard him say, but he did not look round.  We crawled some way before I decided.  "I'll chance it," said I.  He made a belated gesture to prevent me. I stuffed my mouth full. He crouched watching my face, his own twisted into the oddest expression. "It's good," I said.  "O Lord!" he cried.  He watched me munch, his face wrinkled between desire and disapproval, then suddenly succumbed to appetite and began to tear off huge mouthfuls. For a time we did nothing but eat.  The stuff was not unlike a terrestrial mushroom, only it was much laxer in texture, and, as one swallowed it, it warmed the throat. At first we experienced a mere mechanical satisfaction in eating; then our blood began to run warmer, and we tingled at the lips and fingers, and then new and slightly irrelevant ideas came bubbling up in our minds.  "Its good," said I. "Infernally good! What a home for our surplus population! Our poor surplus population," and I broke off another large portion. It filled me with a curiously benevolent satisfaction that there was such good food in the moon. The depression of my hunger gave way to an irrational exhilaration. The dread and discomfort in which I had been living vanished entirely. I perceived the moon no longer as a planet from which I most earnestly desired the means of escape, but as a possible refuge from human destitution. I think I forgot the Selenites, the mooncalves, the lid, and the noises completely so soon as I had eaten that fungus.  Cavor replied to my third repetition of my "surplus population" remark with similar words of approval. I felt that my head swam, but I put this down to the stimulating effect of food after a long fast. "Ess'lent discov'ry yours, Cavor," said I. "Se'nd on'y to the 'tato."  "Whajer mean?" asked Cavor. "'Scovery of the moon--se'nd on'y to the 'tato?"  I looked at him, shocked at his suddenly hoarse voice, and by the badness of his articulation. It occurred to me in a flash that he was intoxicated, possibly by the fungus. It also occurred to me that he erred in imagining that he had discovered the moon; he had not discovered it, he had only reached it. I tried to lay my hand on his arm and explain this to him, but the issue was too subtle for his brain. It was also unexpectedly difficult to express. After a momentary attempt to understand me--I remember wondering if the fungus had made my eyes as fishy as his--he set off upon some observations on his own account.  "We are," he announced with a solemn hiccup, "the creashurs o' what we eat and drink."  He repeated this, and as I was now in one of my subtle moods, I determined to dispute it. Possibly I wandered a little from the point. But Cavor certainly did not attend at all properly. He stood up as well as he could, putting a hand on my head to steady I himself, which was disrespectful, and stood staring about him, quite devoid now of any fear of the moon beings.  I tried to point out that this was dangerous for some reason that was not perfectly clear to me, but the word "dangerous" had somehow got mixed with "indiscreet," and came out rather more like "injurious" than either; and after an attempt to disentangle them, I resumed my argument, addressing myself principally to the unfamiliar but attentive coralline growths on either side. I felt that it was necessary to clear up this confusion between the moon and a potato at once--I wandered into a long parenthesis on the importance of precision of definition in argument. I did my best to ignore the fact that my bodily sensations were no longer agreeable.  In some way that I have now forgotten, my mind was led back to projects of colonisation. "We must annex this moon," I said. "There must be no shilly-shally. This is part of the White Man's Burthen. Cavor--we are--hic--Satap--mean Satraps! Nempire Caesar never dreamt. B'in all the newspapers. Cavorecia. Bedfordecia. Bedfordecia--hic--Limited. Mean--unlimited! Practically."  Certainly I was intoxicated.  I embarked upon an argument to show the infinite benefits our arrival would confer on the moon. I involved myself in a rather difficult proof that the arrival of Columbus was, on the whole, beneficial to America. I found I had forgotten the line of argument I had intended to pursue, and continued to repeat "sim'lar to C'lumbus," to fill up time.  From that point my memory of the action of that abominable fungus becomes confused. I remember vaguely that we declared our intention of standing no nonsense from any confounded insects, that we decided it ill became men to hide shamefully upon a mere satellite, that we equipped ourselves with huge armfuls of the fungus--whether for missile purposes or not I do not know--and, heedless of the stabs of the bayonet scrub, we started forth into the sunshine.  Almost immediately we must have come upon the Selenites. There were six of them, and they were marching in single file over a rocky place, making the most remarkable piping and whining sounds. They all seemed to become aware of us at once, all instantly became silent and motionless, like animals, with their faces turned towards us.  For a moment I was sobered.  "Insects," murmured Cavor, "insects! And they think I'm going to crawl about on my stomach--on my vertebrated stomach!  "Stomach," he repeated slowly, as though he chewed the indignity.  Then suddenly, with a sort of fury, he made three vast strides and leapt towards them. He leapt badly; he made a series of somersaults in the air, whirled right over them, and vanished with an enormous splash amidst the cactus bladders. What the Selenites made of this amazing, and to my mind undignified irruption from another planet, I have no means of guessing. I seem to remember the sight of their backs as they ran in all directions, but I am not sure. All these last incidents before oblivion came are vague and faint in my mind. I know I made a step to follow Cavor, and tripped and fell headlong among the rocks. I was, I am certain, suddenly and vehemently ill. I seem to remember, a violent struggle and being gripped by metallic clasps....  My next clear recollection is that we were prisoners at we knew not what depths beneath the moon's surface; we were in darkness amidst strange distracting noises; our bodies were covered with scratches and bruises, and our heads racked with pain.      Chapter 12     The Selenite's Face  I found myself sitting crouched together in a tumultuous darkness. For a long time I could not understand where I was, nor how I had come to this perplexity. I thought of the cupboard into which I had been thrust at times when I was a child, and then of a very dark and noisy bedroom in which I had slept during an illness. But these sounds about me were not the noises I had known, and there was a thin flavour in the air like the wind of a stable. Then I supposed we must still be at work upon the sphere, and that somehow I had got into the cellar of Cavor's house. I remembered we had finished the sphere, and fancied I must still be in it and travelling through space.  "Cavor," I said, "cannot we have some light?"  There came no answer.  "Cavor!" I insisted.  I was answered by a groan. "My head!" I heard him say; "my head!"  I attempted to press my hands to my brow, which ached, and discovered they were tied together. This startled me very much. I brought them up to my mouth and felt the cold smoothness of metal. They were chained together. I tried to separate my legs and made out they were similarly fastened, and also that I was fastened to the ground by a much thicker chain about the middle of my body.  I was more frightened than I had yet been by anything in all our strange experiences. For a time I tugged silently at my bonds. "Cavor!" I cried out sharply. "Why am I tied? Why have you tied me hand and foot?"  "I haven't tied you," he answered. "It's the Selenites."  The Selenites! My mind hung on that for a space. Then my memories came back to me: the snowy desolation, the thawing of the air, the growth of the plants, our strange hopping and crawling among the rocks and vegetation of the crater. All the distress of our frantic search for the sphere returned to me.... Finally the opening of the great lid that covered the pit!  Then as I strained to trace our later movements down to our present plight, the pain in my head became intolerable. I came to an insurmountable barrier, an obstinate blank.  "Cavor!"  "Yes?"  "Where are we?"  "How should I know?"  "Are we dead?"  "What nonsense!"  "They've got us, then!"  He made no answer but a grunt. The lingering traces of the poison seemed to make him oddly irritable.  "What do you mean to do?"  "How should I know what to do?"  "Oh, very well!" said I, and became silent. Presently, I was roused from a stupor. "O Lord!" I cried; "I wish you'd stop that buzzing!"  We lapsed into silence again, listening to the dull confusion of noises like the muffled sounds of a street or factory that filled our ears. I could make nothing of it, my mind pursued first one rhythm and then another, and questioned it in vain. But after a long time I became aware of a new and sharper element, not mingling with the rest but standing out, as it were, against that cloudy background of sound. It was a series of relatively very little definite sounds, tappings and rubbings, like a loose spray of ivy against a window or a bird moving about upon a box. We listened and peered about us, but the darkness was a velvet pall. There followed a noise like the subtle movement of the wards of a well-oiled lock. And then there appeared before me, hanging as it seemed in an immensity of black, a thin bright line.  "Look!" whispered Cavor very softly.  "What is it?"  "I don't know."  We stared.  The thin bright line became a band, and broader and paler. It took upon itself the quality of a bluish light falling upon a white-washed wall. It ceased to be parallel-sided; it developed a deep indentation on one side. I turned to remark this to Cavor, and was amazed to see his ear in a brilliant illumination--all the rest of him in shadow. I twisted my head round as well as my bonds would permit. "Cavor," I said, "it's behind!"  His ear vanished--gave place to an eye!  Suddenly the crack that had been admitting the light broadened out, and revealed itself as the space of an opening door. Beyond was a sapphire vista, and in the doorway stood a grotesque outline silhouetted against the glare.  We both made convulsive efforts to turn, and failing, sat staring over our shoulders at this. My first impression was of some clumsy quadruped with lowered head. Then I perceived it was the slender pinched body and short and extremely attenuated bandy legs of a Selenite, with his head depressed between his shoulders. He was without the helmet and body covering they wear upon the exterior.  He was a blank, black figure to us, but instinctively our imaginations supplied features to his very human outline. I, at least, took it instantly that he was somewhat hunchbacked, with a high forehead and long features.  He came forward three steps and paused for a time. His movements seemed absolutely noiseless. Then he came forward again. He walked like a bird, his feet fell one in front of the other. He stepped out of the ray of light that came through the doorway, and it seemed as though he vanished altogether in the shadow.  For a moment my eyes sought him in the wrong place, and then I perceived him standing facing us both in the full light. Only the human features I had attributed to him were not there at all!  Of course I ought to have expected that, only I didn't. It came to me as an absolute, for a moment an overwhelming shock. It seemed as though it wasn't a face, as though it must needs be a mask, a horror, a deformity, that would presently be disavowed or explained. There was no nose, and the thing had dull bulging eyes at the side--in the silhouette I had supposed they were ears. There were no ears.... I have tried to draw one of these heads, but I cannot. There was a mouth, downwardly curved, like a human mouth in a face that stares ferociously....  The neck on which the head was poised was jointed in three places, almost like the short joints in the leg of a crab. The joints of the limbs I could not see, because of the puttee-like straps in which they were swathed, and which formed the only clothing the being wore.  There the thing was, looking at us!  At the time my mind was taken up by the mad impossibility of the creature. I suppose he also was amazed, and with more reason, perhaps, for amazement than we. Only, confound him! he did not show it. We did at least know what had brought about this meeting of incompatible creatures. But conceive how it would seem to decent Londoners, for example, to come upon a couple of living things, as big as men and absolutely unlike any other earthly animals, careering about among the sheep in Hyde Park! It must have taken him like that.  Figure us! We were bound hand and foot, fagged and filthy; our beards two inches long, our faces scratched and bloody. Cavor you must imagine in his knickerbockers (torn in several places by the bayonet scrub) his Jaegar shirt and old cricket cap, his wiry hair wildly disordered, a tail to every quarter of the heavens. In that blue light his face did not look red but very dark, his lips and the drying blood upon my hands seemed black. If possible I was in a worse plight than he, on account of the yellow fungus into which I had jumped. Our jackets were unbuttoned, and our shoes had been taken off and lay at our feet. And we were sitting with our backs to this queer bluish light, peering at such a monster as Durer might have invented.  Cavor broke the silence; started to speak, went hoarse, and cleared his throat. Outside began a terrific bellowing, as if a mooncalf were in trouble. It ended in a shriek, and everything was still again.  Presently the Selenite turned about, flickered into the shadow, stood for a moment retrospective at the door, and then closed it on us; and once more we were in that murmurous mystery of darkness into which we had awakened.      Chapter 13     Mr. Cavor Makes Some Suggestions  For a time neither of us spoke. To focus together all the things we had brought upon ourselves seemed beyond my mental powers.  "They've got us," I said at last.  "It was that fungus."  "Well--if I hadn't taken it we should have fainted and starved."  "We might have found the sphere."  I lost my temper at his persistence, and swore to myself. For a time we hated one another in silence. I drummed with my fingers on the floor between my knees, and gritted the links of my fetters together. Presently I was forced to talk again.  "What do you make of it, anyhow?" I asked humbly.  "They are reasonable creatures--they can make things and do things. Those lights we saw..."  He stopped. It was clear he could make nothing of it.  When he spoke again it was to confess, "After all, they are more human than we had a right to expect. I suppose--"  He stopped irritatingly.  "Yes?"  "I suppose, anyhow--on any planet where there is an intelligent animal--it will carry its brain case upward, and have hands, and walk erect."  Presently he broke away in another direction.  "We are some way in," he said. "I mean--perhaps a couple of thousand feet or more."  "Why?"  "It's cooler. And our voices are so much louder. That faded quality--it has altogether gone. And the feeling in one's ears and throat."  I had not noted that, but I did now.  "The air is denser. We must be some depths--a mile even, we may be--inside the moon."  "We never thought of a world inside the moon."  "No."  "How could we?"  "We might have done. Only one gets into habits of mind."  He thought for a time.  "Now," he said, "it seems such an obvious thing."  "Of course! The moon must be enormously cavernous, with an atmosphere within, and at the centre of its caverns a sea.  "One knew that the moon had a lower specific gravity than the earth, one knew that it had little air or water outside, one knew, too, that it was sister planet to the earth, and that it was unaccountable that it should be different in composition. The inference that it was hollowed out was as clear as day. And yet one never saw it as a fact. Kepler, of course--"  His voice had the interest now of a man who has discerned a pretty sequence of reasoning.  "Yes," he said, "Kepler with his sub-volvani was right after all."  "I wish you had taken the trouble to find that out before we came," I said.  He answered nothing, buzzing to himself softly, as he pursued his thoughts. My temper was going.  "What do you think has become of the sphere, anyhow?" I asked.  "Lost," he said, like a man who answers an uninteresting question.  "Among those plants?"  "Unless they find it."  "And then?"  "How can I tell?"  "Cavor," I said, with a sort of hysterical bitterness, "things look bright for my Company..."  He made no answer.  "Good Lord!" I exclaimed. "Just think of all the trouble we took to get into this pickle! What did we come for? What are we after? What was the moon to us or we to the moon? We wanted too much, we tried too much. We ought to have started the little things first. It was you proposed the moon! Those Cavorite spring blinds! I am certain we could have worked them for terrestrial purposes. Certain! Did you really understand what I proposed? A steel cylinder--"  "Rubbish!" said Cavor.  We ceased to converse.  For a time Cavor kept up a broken monologue without much help from me.  "If they find it," he began, "if they find it ... what will they do with it? Well, that's a question. It may be that's _the_ question. They won't understand it, anyhow. If they understood that sort of thing they would have come long since to the earth. Would they? Why shouldn't they? But they would have sent something--they couldn't keep their hands off such a possibility. No! But they will examine it. Clearly they are intelligent and inquisitive. They will examine it--get inside it--trifle with the studs. Off! ... That would mean the moon for us for all the rest of our lives. Strange creatures, strange knowledge...."  "As for strange knowledge--" said I, and language failed me.  "Look here, Bedford," said Cavor, "you came on this expedition of your own free will."  "You said to me, 'Call it prospecting'."  "There's always risks in prospecting."  "Especially when you do it unarmed and without thinking out every possibility."  "I was so taken up with the sphere. The thing rushed on us, and carried us away."  "Rushed on _me_, you mean."  "Rushed on me just as much. How was I to know when I set to work on molecular physics that the business would bring me here--of all places?"  "It's this accursed science," I cried. "It's the very Devil. The medieval priests and persecutors were right and the Moderns are all wrong. You tamper with it--and it offers you gifts. And directly you take them it knocks you to pieces in some unexpected way. Old passions and new weapons--now it upsets your religion, now it upsets your social ideas, now it whirls you off to desolation and misery!"  "Anyhow, it's no use your quarrelling with me now. These creatures--these Selenites, or whatever we choose to call them--have got us tied hand and foot. Whatever temper you choose to go through with it in, you will have to go through with it.... We have experiences before us that will need all our coolness."  He paused as if he required my assent. But I sat sulking. "Confound your science!" I said.  "The problem is communication. Gestures, I fear, will be different. Pointing, for example. No creatures but men and monkeys point."  That was too obviously wrong for me. "Pretty nearly every animal," I cried, "points with its eyes or nose."  Cavor meditated over that. "Yes," he said at last, "and we don't. There's such differences--such differences!"  "One might.... But how can I tell? There is speech. The sounds they make, a sort of fluting and piping. I don't see how we are to imitate that. Is it their speech, that sort of thing? They may have different senses, different means of communication. Of course they are minds and we are minds; there must be something in common. Who knows how far we may not get to an understanding?"  "The things are outside us," I said. "They're more different from us than the strangest animals on earth. They are a different clay. What is the good of talking like this?"  Cavor thought. "I don't see that. Where there are minds they will have something similar--even though they have been evolved on different planets. Of course if it was a question of instincts, if we or they are no more than animals--"  "Well, are they? They're much more like ants on their hind legs than human beings, and who ever got to any sort of understanding with ants?"  "But these machines and clothing! No, I don't hold with you, Bedford. The difference is wide--"  "It's insurmountable."  "The resemblance must bridge it. I remember reading once a paper by the late Professor Galton on the possibility of communication between the planets. Unhappily, at that time it did not seem probable that that would be of any material benefit to me, and I fear I did not give it the attention I should have done--in view of this state of affairs. Yet.... Now, let me see!  "His idea was to begin with those broad truths that must underlie all conceivable mental existences and establish a basis on those. The great principles of geometry, to begin with. He proposed to take some leading proposition of Euclid's, and show by construction that its truth was known to us, to demonstrate, for example, that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle are equal, and that if the equal sides be produced the angles on the other side of the base are equal also, or that the square on the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the two other sides. By demonstrating our knowledge of these things we should demonstrate our possession of a reasonable intelligence.... Now, suppose I ... I might draw the geometrical figure with a wet finger, or even trace it in the air...."  He fell silent. I sat meditating his words. For a time his wild hope of communication, of interpretation, with these weird beings held me. Then that angry despair that was a part of my exhaustion and physical misery resumed its sway. I perceived with a sudden novel vividness the extraordinary folly of everything I had ever done. "Ass!" I said; "oh, ass, unutterable ass.... I seem to exist only to go about doing preposterous things. Why did we ever leave the thing? ... Hopping about looking for patents and concessions in the craters of the moon!... If only we had had the sense to fasten a handkerchief to a stick to show where we had left the sphere!"  I subsided, fuming.  "It is clear," meditated Cavor, "they are intelligent. One can hypothecate certain things. As they have not killed us at once, they must have ideas of mercy. Mercy! at any rate of restraint. Possibly of intercourse. They may meet us. And this apartment and the glimpses we had of its guardian. These fetters! A high degree of intelligence..."  "I wish to heaven," cried I, "I'd thought even twice! Plunge after plunge. First one fluky start and then another. It was my confidence in you! Why didn't I stick to my play? That was what I was equal to. That was my world and the life I was made for. I could have finished that play. I'm certain ... it was a good play. I had the scenario as good as done. Then.... Conceive it! leaping to the moon! Practically--I've thrown my life away! That old woman in the inn near Canterbury had better sense."  I looked up, and stopped in mid-sentence. The darkness had given place to that bluish light again. The door was opening, and several noiseless Selenites were coming into the chamber. I became quite still, staring at their grotesque faces.  Then suddenly my sense of disagreeable strangeness changed to interest. I perceived that the foremost and second carried bowls. One elemental need at least our minds could understand in common. They were bowls of some metal that, like our fetters, looked dark in that bluish light; and each contained a number of whitish fragments. All the cloudy pain and misery that oppressed me rushed together and took the shape of hunger. I eyed these bowls wolfishly, and, though it returned to me in dreams, at that time it seemed a small matter that at the end of the arms that lowered one towards me were not hands, but a sort of flap and thumb, like the end of an elephant's trunk. The stuff in the bowl was loose in texture, and whitish brown in colour--rather like lumps of some cold souffle, and it smelt faintly like mushrooms. From a partially divided carcass of a mooncalf that we presently saw, I am inclined to believe it must have been mooncalf flesh.  My hands were so tightly chained that I could barely contrive to reach the bowl; but when they saw the effort I made, two of them dexterously released one of the turns about my wrist. Their tentacle hands were soft and cold to my skin. I immediately seized a mouthful of the food. It had the same laxness in texture that all organic structures seem to have upon the moon; it tasted rather like a gauffre or a damp meringue, but in no way was it disagreeable. I took two other mouthfuls. "I wanted--foo'!" said I, tearing off a still larger piece....  For a time we ate with an utter absence of self-consciousness. We ate and presently drank like tramps in a soup kitchen. Never before nor since have I been hungry to the ravenous pitch, and save that I have had this very experience I could never have believed that, a quarter of a million of miles out of our proper world, in utter perplexity of soul, surrounded, watched, touched by beings more grotesque and inhuman than the worst creations of a nightmare, it would be possible for me to eat in utter forgetfulness of all these things. They stood about us watching us, and ever and again making a slight elusive twittering that stood the suppose, in the stead of speech. I did not even shiver at their touch. And when the first zeal of my feeding was over, I could note that Cavor, too, had been eating with the same shameless abandon.      Chapter 14     Experiments in intercourse  When at last we had made an end of eating, the Selenites linked our hands closely together again, and then untwisted the chains about our feet and rebound them, so as to give us a limited freedom of movement. Then they unfastened the chains about our waists. To do all this they had to handle us freely, and ever and again one of their queer heads came down close to my face, or a soft tentacle-hand touched my head or neck. I don't remember that I was afraid then or repelled by their proximity. I think that our incurable anthropomorphism made us imagine there were human heads inside their masks. The skin, like everything else, looked bluish, but that was on account of the light; and it was hard and shiny, quite in the beetle-wing fashion, not soft, or moist, or hairy, as a vertebrated animal's would be. Along the crest of the head was a low ridge of whitish spines running from back to front, and a much larger ridge curved on either side over the eyes. The Selenite who untied me used his mouth to help his hands.  "They seem to be releasing us," said Cavor. "Remember we are on the moon! Make no sudden movements!"  "Are you going to try that geometry?"  "If I get a chance. But, of course, they may make an advance first."  We remained passive, and the Selenites, having finished their arrangements, stood back from us, and seemed to be looking at us. I say seemed to be, because as their eyes were at the side and not in front, one had the same difficulty in determining the direction in which they were looking as one has in the case of a hen or a fish. They conversed with one another in their reedy tones, that seemed to me impossible to imitate or define. The door behind us opened wider, and, glancing over my shoulder, I saw a vague large space beyond, in which quite a little crowd of Selenites were standing. They seemed a curiously miscellaneous rabble.  "Do they want us to imitate those sounds?" I asked Cavor.  "I don't think so," he said.  "It seems to me that they are trying to make us understand something."  "I can't make anything of their gestures. Do you notice this one, who is worrying with his head like a man with an uncomfortable collar?"  "Let us shake our heads at him."  We did that, and finding it ineffectual, attempted an imitation of the Selenites' movements. That seemed to interest them. At any rate they all set up the same movement. But as that seemed to lead to nothing, we desisted at last and so did they, and fell into a piping argument among themselves. Then one of them, shorter and very much thicker than the others, and with a particularly wide mouth, squatted down suddenly beside Cavor, and put his hands and feet in the same posture as Cavor's were bound, and then by a dexterous movement stood up.  "Cavor," I shouted, "they want us to get up!"  He stared open-mouthed. "That's it!" he said.  And with much heaving and grunting, because our hands were tied together, we contrived to struggle to our feet. The Selenites made way for our elephantine heavings, and seemed to twitter more volubly. As soon as we were on our feet the thick-set Selenite came and patted each of our faces with his tentacles, and walked towards the open doorway. That also was plain enough, and we followed him. We saw that four of the Selenites standing in the doorway were much taller than the others, and clothed in the same manner as those we had seen in the crater, namely, with spiked round helmets and cylindrical body-cases, and that each of the four carried a goad with spike and guard made of that same dull-looking metal as the bowls. These four closed about us, one on either side of each of us, as we emerged from our chamber into the cavern from which the light had come.  We did not get our impression of that cavern all at once. Our attention was taken up by the movements and attitudes of the Selenites immediately about us, and by the necessity of controlling our motion, lest we should startle and alarm them and ourselves by some excessive stride. In front of us was the short, thick-set being who had solved the problem of asking us to get up, moving with gestures that seemed, almost all of them, intelligible to us, inviting us to follow him. His spout-like face turned from one of us to the other with a quickness that was clearly interrogative. For a time, I say, we were taken up with these things.  But at last the great place that formed a background to our movements asserted itself. It became apparent that the source of much, at least, of the tumult of sounds which had filled our ears ever since we had recovered from the stupefaction of the fungus was a vast mass of machinery in active movement, whose flying and whirling parts were visible indistinctly over the heads and between the bodies of the Selenites who walked about us. And not only did the web of sounds that filled the air proceed from this mechanism, but also the peculiar blue light that irradiated the whole place. We had taken it as a natural thing that a subterranean cavern should be artificially lit, and even now, though the fact was patent to my eyes, I did not really grasp its import until presently the darkness came. The meaning and structure of this huge apparatus we saw I cannot explain, because we neither of us learnt what it was for or how it worked. One after another, big shafts of metal flung out and up from its centre, their heads travelling in what seemed to me to be a parabolic path; each dropped a sort of dangling arm as it rose towards the apex of its flight and plunged down into a vertical cylinder, forcing this down before it. About it moved the shapes of tenders, little figures that seemed vaguely different from the beings about us. As each of the three dangling arms of the machine plunged down, there was a clank and then a roaring, and out of the top of the vertical cylinder came pouring this incandescent substance that lit the place, and ran over as milk runs over a boiling pot, and dripped luminously into a tank of light below. It was a cold blue light, a sort of phosphorescent glow but infinitely brighter, and from the tanks into which it fell it ran in conduits athwart the cavern.  Thud, thud, thud, thud, came the sweeping arms of this unintelligible apparatus, and the light substance hissed and poured. At first the thing seemed only reasonably large and near to us, and then I saw how exceedingly little the Selenites upon it seemed, and I realised the full immensity of cavern and machine. I looked from this tremendous affair to the faces of the Selenites with a new respect. I stopped, and Cavor stopped, and stared at this thunderous engine.  "But this is stupendous!" I said. "What can it be for?"  Cavor's blue-lit face was full of an intelligent respect. "I can't dream! Surely these beings-- Men could not make a thing like that! Look at those arms, are they on connecting rods?"  The thick-set Selenite had gone some paces unheeded. He came back and stood between us and the great machine. I avoided seeing him, because I guessed somehow that his idea was to beckon us onward. He walked away in the direction he wished us to go, and turned and came back, and flicked our faces to attract our attention.  Cavor and I looked at one another.  "Cannot we show him we are interested in the machine?" I said.  "Yes," said Cavor. "We'll try that." He turned to our guide and smiled, and pointed to the machine, and pointed again, and then to his head, and then to the machine. By some defect of reasoning he seemed to imagine that broken English might help these gestures. "Me look 'im," he said, "me think 'im very much. Yes."  His behaviour seemed to check the Selenites in their desire for our progress for a moment. They faced one another, their queer heads moved, the twittering voices came quick and liquid. Then one of them, a lean, tall creature, with a sort of mantle added to the puttee in which the others were dressed, twisted his elephant trunk of a hand about Cavor's waist, and pulled him gently to follow our guide, who again went on ahead. Cavor resisted. "We may just as well begin explaining ourselves now. They may think we are new animals, a new sort of mooncalf perhaps! It is most important that we should show an intelligent interest from the outset."  He began to shake his head violently. "No, no," he said, "me not come on one minute. Me look at 'im."  "Isn't there some geometrical point you might bring in apropos of that affair?" I suggested, as the Selenites conferred again.  "Possibly a parabolic--" he began.  He yelled loudly, and leaped six feet or more!  One of the four armed moon-men had pricked him with a goad!  I turned on the goad-bearer behind me with a swift threatening gesture, and he started back. This and Cavor's sudden shout and leap clearly astonished all the Selenites. They receded hastily, facing us. For one of those moments that seem to last for ever, we stood in angry protest, with a scattered semicircle of these inhuman beings about us.  "He pricked me!" said Cavor, with a catching of the voice.  "I saw him," I answered.  "Confound it!" I said to the Selenites; "we're not going to stand that! What on earth do you take us for?"  I glanced quickly right and left. Far away across the blue wilderness of cavern I saw a number of other Selenites running towards us; broad and slender they were, and one with a larger head than the others. The cavern spread wide and low, and receded in every direction into darkness. Its roof, I remember, seemed to bulge down as if with the weight of the vast thickness of rocks that prisoned us. There was no way out of it--no way out of it. Above, below, in every direction, was the unknown, and these inhuman creatures, with goads and gestures, confronting us, and we two unsupported men!      Chapter 15     The Giddy Bridge  Just for a moment that hostile pause endured. I suppose that both we and the Selenites did some very rapid thinking. My clearest impression was that there was nothing to put my back against, and that we were bound to be surrounded and killed. The overwhelming folly of our presence there loomed over me in black, enormous reproach. Why had I ever launched myself on this mad, inhuman expedition?  Cavor came to my side and laid his hand on my arm. His pale and terrified face was ghastly in the blue light.  "We can't do anything," he said. "It's a mistake. They don't understand. We must go. As they want us to go."  I looked down at him, and then at the fresh Selenites who were coming to help their fellows. "If I had my hands free--"  "It's no use," he panted.  "No."  "We'll go."  And he turned about and led the way in the direction that had been indicated for us.  I followed, trying to look as subdued as possible, and feeling at the chains about my wrists. My blood was boiling. I noted nothing more of that cavern, though it seemed to take a long time before we had marched across it, or if I noted anything I forgot it as I saw it. My thoughts were concentrated, I think, upon my chains and the Selenites, and particularly upon the helmeted ones with the goads. At first they marched parallel with us, and at a respectful distance, but presently they were overtaken by three others, and then they drew nearer, until they were within arms length again. I winced like a beaten horse as they came near to us. The shorter, thicker Selenite marched at first on our right flank, but presently came in front of us again.  How well the picture of that grouping has bitten into my brain; the back of Cavor's downcast head just in front of me, and the dejected droop of his shoulders, and our guide's gaping visage, perpetually jerking about him, and the goad-bearers on either side, watchful, yet open-mouthed--a blue monochrome. And after all, I do remember one other thing besides the purely personal affair, which is, that a sort of gutter came presently across the floor of the cavern, and then ran along by the side of the path of rock we followed. And it was full of that same bright blue luminous stuff that flowed out of the great machine. I walked close beside it, and I can testify it radiated not a particle of heat. It was brightly shining, and yet it was neither warmer nor colder than anything else in the cavern.  Clang, clang, clang, we passed right under the thumping levers of another vast machine, and so came at last to a wide tunnel, in which we could even hear the pad, pad, of our shoeless feet, and which, save for the trickling thread of blue to the right of us, was quite unlit. The shadows made gigantic travesties of our shapes and those of the Selenites on the irregular wall and roof of the tunnel. Ever and again crystals in the walls of the tunnel scintillated like gems, ever and again the tunnel expanded into a stalactitic cavern, or gave off branches that vanished into darkness.  We seemed to be marching down that tunnel for a long time. "Trickle, trickle," went the flowing light very softly, and our footfalls and their echoes made an irregular paddle, paddle. My mind settled down to the question of my chains. If I were to slip off one turn _so_, and then to twist it _so_ ...  If I tried to do it very gradually, would they see I was slipping my wrist out of the looser turn? If they did, what would they do?  "Bedford," said Cavor, "it goes down. It keeps on going down."  His remark roused me from my sullen pre-occupation.  "If they wanted to kill us," he said, dropping back to come level with me, "there is no reason why they should not have done it."  "No," I admitted, "that's true."  "They don't understand us," he said, "they think we are merely strange animals, some wild sort of mooncalf birth, perhaps. It will be only when they have observed us better that they will begin to think we have minds--"  "When you trace those geometrical problems," said I.  "It may be that."  We tramped on for a space.  "You see," said Cavor, "these may be Selenites of a lower class."  "The infernal fools!" said I viciously, glancing at their exasperating faces.  "If we endure what they do to us--"  "We've got to endure it," said I.  "There may be others less stupid. This is the mere outer fringe of their world. It must go down and down, cavern, passage, tunnel, down at last to the sea--hundreds of miles below."  His words made me think of the mile or so of rock and tunnel that might be over our heads already. It was like a weight dropping, on my shoulders. "Away from the sun and air," I said. "Even a mine half a mile deep is stuffy." remarked.  "This is not, anyhow. It's probable--Ventilation! The air would blow from the dark side of the moon to the sunlit, and all the carbonic acid would well out there and feed those plants. Up this tunnel, for example, there is quite a breeze. And what a world it must be. The earnest we have in that shaft, and those machines--"  "And the goad," I said. "Don't forget the goad!"  He walked a little in front of me for a time.  "Even that goad--" he said.  "Well?"  "I was angry at the time. But--it was perhaps necessary we should get on. They have different skins, and probably different nerves. They may not understand our objection--just as a being from Mars might not like our earthly habit of nudging."  "They'd better be careful how they nudge me."  "And about that geometry. After all, their way is a way of understanding, too. They begin with the elements of life and not of thought. Food. Compulsion. Pain. They strike at fundamentals."  "There's no doubt about that," I said.  He went on to talk of the enormous and wonderful world into which we were being taken. I realised slowly from his tone, that even now he was not absolutely in despair at the prospect of going ever deeper into this inhuman planet-burrow. His mind ran on machines and invention, to the exclusion of a thousand dark things that beset me. It wasn't that he intended to make any use of these things, he simply wanted to know them.  "After all," he said, "this is a tremendous occasion. It is the meeting of two worlds! What are we going to see? Think of what is below us here."  "We shan't see much if the light isn't better," I remarked.  "This is only the outer crust. Down below-- On this scale-- There will be everything. Do you notice how different they seem one from another? The story we shall take back!"  "Some rare sort of animal," I said, "might comfort himself in that way while they were bringing him to the Zoo.... It doesn't follow that we are going to be shown all these things."  "When they find we have reasonable minds," said Cavor, "they will want to learn about the earth. Even if they have no generous emotions, they will teach in order to learn.... And the things they must know! The unanticipated things!"  He went on to speculate on the possibility of their knowing things he had never hoped to learn on earth, speculating in that way, with a raw wound from that goad already in his skin! Much that he said I forget, for my attention was drawn to the fact that the tunnel along which we had been marching was opening out wider and wider. We seemed, from the feeling of the air, to be going out into a huge space. But how big the space might really be we could not tell, because it was unlit. Our little stream of light ran in a dwindling thread and vanished far ahead. Presently the rocky walls had vanished altogether on either hand. There was nothing to be seen but the path in front of us and the trickling hurrying rivulet of blue phosphorescence. The figures of Cavor and the guiding Selenite marched before me, the sides of their legs and heads that were towards the rivulet were clear and bright blue, their darkened sides, now that the reflection of the tunnel wall no longer lit them, merged indistinguishably in the darkness beyond.  And soon I perceived that we were approaching a declivity of some sort, because the little blue stream dipped suddenly out of sight.  In another moment, as it seemed, we had reached the edge. The shining stream gave one meander of hesitation and then rushed over. It fell to a depth at which the sound of its descent was absolutely lost to us. Far below was a bluish glow, a sort of blue mist--at an infinite distance below. And the darkness the stream dropped out of became utterly void and black, save that a thing like a plank projected from the edge of the cliff and stretched out and faded and vanished altogether. There was a warm air blowing up out of the gulf.  For a moment I and Cavor stood as near the edge as we dared, peering into a blue-tinged profundity. And then our guide was pulling at my arm.  Then he left me, and walked to the end of that plank and stepped upon it, looking back. Then when he perceived we watched him, he turned about and went on along it, walking as surely as though he was on firm earth. For a moment his form was distinct, then he became a blue blur, and then vanished into the obscurity. I became aware of some vague shape looming darkly out of the black.  There was a pause. "Surely!--" said Cavor.  One of the other Selenites walked a few paces out upon the plank, and turned and looked back at us unconcernedly. The others stood ready to follow after us. Our guide's expectant figure reappeared. He was returning to see why we had not advanced.  "What is that beyond there?" I asked.  "I can't see."  "We can't cross this at any price," said I.  "I could not go three steps on it," said Cavor, "even with my hands free."  We looked at each other's drawn faces in blank consternation.  "They can't know what it is to be giddy!" said Cavor.  "It's quite impossible for us to walk that plank."  "I don't believe they see as we do. I've been watching them. I wonder if they know this is simply blackness for us. How can we make them understand?"  "Anyhow, we must make them understand."  I think we said these things with a vague half hope the Selenites might somehow understand. I knew quite clearly that all that was needed was an explanation. Then as I saw their faces, I realised that an explanation was impossible. Just here it was that our resemblances were not going to bridge our differences. Well, I wasn't going to walk the plank, anyhow. I slipped my wrist very quickly out of the coil of chain that was loose, and then began to twist my wrists in opposite directions. I was standing nearest to the bridge, and as I did this two of the Selenites laid hold of me, and pulled me gently towards it.  I shook my head violently. "No go," I said, "no use. You don't understand."  Another Selenite added his compulsion. I was forced to step forward.  "I've got an idea," said Cavor; but I knew his ideas.  "Look here!" I exclaimed to the Selenites. "Steady on! It's all very well for you--"  I sprang round upon my heel. I burst out into curses. For one of the armed Selenites had stabbed me behind with his goad.  I wrenched my wrists free from the little tentacles that held them. I turned on the goad-bearer. "Confound you!" I cried. "I've warned you of that. What on earth do you think I'm made of, to stick that into me? If you touch me again--"  By way of answer he pricked me forthwith.  I heard Cavor's voice in alarm and entreaty. Even then I think he wanted to compromise with these creatures. "I say, Bedford," he cried, "I know a way!" But the sting of that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us unresisting in the hands of these moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round my fist.  There came another of these beastly surprises of which the moon world is full.  My mailed hand seemed to go clean through him. He smashed like--like some softish sort of sweet with liquid in it! He broke right in! He squelched and splashed. It was like hitting a damp toadstool. The flimsy body went spinning a dozen yards, and fell with a flabby impact. I was astonished. I was incredulous that any living thing could be so flimsy. For an instant I could have believed the whole thing a dream.  Then it had become real and imminent again. Neither Cavor nor the other Selenites seemed to have done anything from the time when I had turned about to the time when the dead Selenite hit the ground. Every one stood back from us two, every one alert. That arrest seemed to last at least a second after the Selenite was down. Every one must have been taking the thing in. I seem to remember myself standing with my arm half retracted, trying also to take it in. "What next?" clamoured my brain; "what next?" Then in a moment every one was moving!  I perceived we must get our chains loose, and that before we could do this these Selenites had to be beaten off. I faced towards the group of the three goad-bearers. Instantly one threw his goad at me. It swished over my head, and I suppose went flying into the abyss behind.  I leaped right at him with all my might as the goad flew over me. He turned to run as I jumped, and I bore him to the ground, came down right upon him, and slipped upon his smashed body and fell. He seemed to wriggle under my foot.  I came into a sitting position, and on every hand the blue backs of the Selenites were receding into the darkness. I bent a link by main force and untwisted the chain that had hampered me about the ankles, and sprang to my feet, with the chain in my hand. Another goad, flung javelin-wise, whistled by me, and I made a rush towards the darkness out of which it had come. Then I turned back towards Cavor, who was still standing in the light of the rivulet near the gulf convulsively busy with his wrists, and at the same time jabbering nonsense about his idea.  "Come on!" I cried.  "My hands!" he answered.  Then, realising that I dared not run back to him, because my ill-calculated steps might carry me over the edge, he came shuffling towards me, with his hands held out before him.  I gripped his chains at once to unfasten them.  "Where are they?" he panted.  "Run away. They'll come back. They're throwing things! Which way shall we go?"  "By the light. To that tunnel. Eh?"  "Yes," said I, and his hands were free.  I dropped on my knees and fell to work on his ankle bonds. Whack came something--I know not what--and splashed the livid streamlet into drops about us. Far away on our right a piping and whistling began.  I whipped the chain off his feet, and put it in his hand. "Hit with that!" I said, and without waiting for an answer, set off in big bounds along the path by which we had come. I had a nasty sort of feeling that these things could jump out of the darkness on to my back. I heard the impact of his leaps come following after me.  We ran in vast strides. But that running, you must understand, was an altogether different thing from any running on earth. On earth one leaps and almost instantly hits the ground again, but on the moon, because of its weaker pull, one shot through the air for several seconds before one came to earth. In spite of our violent hurry this gave an effect of long pauses, pauses in which one might have counted seven or eight. "Step," and one soared off! All sorts of questions ran through my mind: "Where are the Selenites? What will they do? Shall we ever get to that tunnel? Is Cavor far behind? Are they likely to cut him off?" Then whack, stride, and off again for another step.  I saw a Selenite running in front of me, his legs going exactly as a man's would go on earth, saw him glance over his shoulder, and heard him shriek as he ran aside out of my way into the darkness. He was, I think, our guide, but I am not sure. Then in another vast stride the walls of rock had come into view on either hand, and in two more strides I was in the tunnel, and tempering my pace to its low roof. I went on to a bend, then stopped and turned back, and plug, plug, plug, Cavor came into view, splashing into the stream of blue light at every stride, and grew larger and blundered into me. We stood clutching each other. For a moment, at least, we had shaken off our captors and were alone.  We were both very much out of breath. We spoke in panting, broken sentences.  "You've spoilt it all!" panted Cavor. "Nonsense," I cried. "It was that or death!"  "What are we to do?"  "Hide."  "How can we?"  "It's dark enough."  "But where?"  "Up one of these side caverns."  "And then?"  "Think."  "Right--come on."  We strode on, and presently came to a radiating dark cavern. Cavor was in front. He hesitated, and chose a black mouth that seemed to promise good hiding. He went towards it and turned.  "It's dark," he said.  "Your legs and feet will light us. You're wet with that luminous stuff."  "But--"  A tumult of sounds, and in particular a sound like a clanging gong, advancing up the main tunnel, became audible. It was horribly suggestive of a tumultuous pursuit. We made a bolt for the unlit side cavern forthwith. As we ran along it our way was lit by the irradiation of Cavor's legs. "It's lucky," I panted, "they took off our boots, or we should fill this place with clatter." On we rushed, taking as small steps as we could to avoid striking the roof of the cavern. After a time we seemed to be gaining on the uproar. It became muffled, it dwindled, it died away.  I stopped and looked back, and I heard the pad, pad of Cavor's feet receding. Then he stopped also. "Bedford," he whispered; "there's a sort of light in front of us."  I looked, and at first could see nothing. Then I perceived his head and shoulders dimly outlined against a fainter darkness. I saw, also, that this mitigation of the darkness was not blue, as all the other light within the moon had been, but a pallid gray, a very vague, faint white, the daylight colour. Cavor noted this difference as soon, or sooner, than I did, and I think, too, that it filled him with much the same wild hope.  "Bedford," he whispered, and his voice trembled. "That light--it is possible--"  He did not dare to say the thing he hoped. Then came a pause. Suddenly I knew by the sound of his feet that he was striding towards that pallor. I followed him with a beating heart.      Chapter 16     Points of View  The light grew stronger as we advanced. In a little time it was nearly as strong as the phosphorescence on Cavor's legs. Our tunnel was expanding into a cavern, and this new light was at the farther end of it. I perceived something that set my hopes leaping and bounding.  "Cavor," I said, "it comes from above! I am certain it comes from above!"  He made no answer, but hurried on.  Indisputably it was a gray light, a silvery light.  In another moment we were beneath it. It filtered down through a chink in the walls of the cavern, and as I stared up, drip, came a drop of water upon my face. I started and stood aside--drip, fell another drop quite audibly on the rocky floor.  "Cavor," I said, "if one of us lifts the other, he can reach that crack!"  "I'll lift you," he said, and incontinently hoisted me as though I was a baby.  I thrust an arm into the crack, and just at my finger tips found a little ledge by which I could hold. I could see the white light was very much brighter now. I pulled myself up by two fingers with scarcely an effort, though on earth I weigh twelve stone, reached to a still higher corner of rock, and so got my feet on the narrow ledge. I stood up and searched up the rocks with my fingers; the cleft broadened out upwardly. "It's climbable," I said to Cavor. "Can you jump up to my hand if I hold it down to you?"  I wedged myself between the sides of the cleft, rested knee and foot on the ledge, and extended a hand. I could not see Cavor, but I could hear the rustle of his movements as he crouched to spring. Then whack and he was hanging to my arm--and no heavier than a kitten! I lugged him up until he had a hand on my ledge, and could release me.  "Confound it!" I said, "any one could be a mountaineer on the moon;" and so set myself in earnest to the climbing. For a few minutes I clambered steadily, and then I looked up again. The cleft opened out steadily, and the light was brighter. Only--  It was not daylight after all.  In another moment I could see what it was, and at the sight I could have beaten my head against the rocks with disappointment. For I beheld simply an irregularly sloping open space, and all over its slanting floor stood a forest of little club-shaped fungi, each shining gloriously with that pinkish silvery light. For a moment I stared at their soft radiance, then sprang forward and upward among them. I plucked up half a dozen and flung them against the rocks, and then sat down, laughing bitterly, as Cavor's ruddy face came into view.  "It's phosphorescence again!" I said. "No need to hurry. Sit down and make yourself at home." And as he spluttered over our disappointment, I began to lob more of these growths into the cleft.  "I thought it was daylight," he said.  "Daylight!" cried I. "Daybreak, sunset, clouds, and windy skies! Shall we ever see such things again?"  As I spoke, a little picture of our world seemed to rise before me, bright and little and clear, like the background of some old Italian picture. "The sky that changes, and the sea that changes, and the hills and the green trees and the towns and cities shining in the sun. Think of a wet roof at sunset, Cavor! Think of the windows of a westward house!" He made no answer.  "Here we are burrowing in this beastly world that isn't a world, with its inky ocean hidden in some abominable blackness below, and outside that torrid day and that death stillness of night. And all these things that are chasing us now, beastly men of leather--insect men, that come out of a nightmare! After all, they're right! What business have we here smashing them and disturbing their world! For all we know the whole planet is up and after us already. In a minute we may hear them whimpering, and their gongs going. What are we to do? Where are we to go? Here we are as comfortable as snakes from Jamrach's loose in a Surbiton villa!"  "It was your fault," said Cavor.  "My fault!" I shouted. "Good Lord!"  "I had an idea!"  "Curse your ideas!"  "If we had refused to budge--"  "Under those goads?"  "Yes. They would have carried us!"  "Over that bridge?"  "Yes. They must have carried us from outside."  "I'd rather be carried by a fly across a ceiling."  "Good Heavens!"  I resumed my destruction of the fungi. Then suddenly I saw something that struck me even then. "Cavor," I said, "these chains are of gold!"  He was thinking intently, with his hands gripping his cheeks. He turned his head slowly and stared at me, and when I had repeated my words, at the twisted chain about his right hand. "So they are," he said, "so they are." His face lost its transitory interest even as he looked. He hesitated for a moment, then went on with his interrupted meditation. I sat for a space puzzling over the fact that I had only just observed this, until I considered the blue light in which we had been, and which had taken all the colour out of the metal. And from that discovery I also started upon a train of thought that carried me wide and far. I forgot that I had just been asking what business we had in the moon. Gold....  It was Cavor who spoke first. "It seems to me that there are two courses open to us."  "Well?"  "Either we can attempt to make our way--fight our way if necessary--out to the exterior again, and then hunt for our sphere until we find it, or the cold of the night comes to kill us, or else--"  He paused. "Yes?" I said, though I knew what was coming.  "We might attempt once more to establish some sort of understanding with the minds of the people in the moon."  "So far as I'm concerned--it's the first."  "I doubt."  "I don't."  "You see," said Cavor, "I do not think we can judge the Selenites by what we have seen of them. Their central world, their civilised world will be far below in the profounder caverns about their sea. This region of the crust in which we are is an outlying district, a pastoral region. At any rate, that is my interpretation. These Selenites we have seen may be only the equivalent of cowboys and engine-tenders. Their use of goads--in all probability mooncalf goads--the lack of imagination they show in expecting us to be able to do just what they can do, their indisputable brutality, all seem to point to something of that sort. But if we endured--"  "Neither of us could endure a six-inch plank across the bottomless pit for very long."  "No," said Cavor; "but then--"  "I _won't_," I said.  He discovered a new line of possibilities. "Well, suppose we got ourselves into some corner, where we could defend ourselves against these hinds and labourers. If, for example, we could hold out for a week or so, it is probable that the news of our appearance would filter down to the more intelligent and populous parts--"  "If they exist."  "They must exist, or whence came those tremendous machines?"  "That's possible, but it's the worst of the two chances."  "We might write up inscriptions on walls--"  "How do we know their eyes would see the sort of marks we made?"  "If we cut them--"  "That's possible, of course."  I took up a new thread of thought. "After all," I said, "I suppose you don't think these Selenites so infinitely wiser than men."  "They must know a lot more--or at least a lot of different things."  "Yes, but--" I hesitated.  "I think you'll quite admit, Cavor, that you're rather an exceptional man."  "How?"  "Well, you--you're a rather lonely man--have been, that is. You haven't married."  "Never wanted to. But why--"  "And you never grew richer than you happened to be?"  "Never wanted that either."  "You've just rooted after knowledge?"  "Well, a certain curiosity is natural--"  "You think so. That's just it. You think every other mind wants to know. I remember once, when I asked you why you conducted all these researches, you said you wanted your F.R.S., and to have the stuff called Cavorite, and things like that. You know perfectly well you didn't do it for that; but at the time my question took you by surprise, and you felt you ought to have something to look like a motive. Really you conducted researches because you had to. It's your twist."  "Perhaps it is--"  "It isn't one man in a million has that twist. Most men want--well, various things, but very few want knowledge for its own sake. I don't, I know perfectly well. Now, these Selenites seem to be a driving, busy sort of being, but how do you know that even the most intelligent will take an interest in us or our world? I don't believe they'll even know we have a world. They never come out at night--they'd freeze if they did. They've probably never seen any heavenly body at all except the blazing sun. How are they to know there is another world? What does it matter to them if they do? Well, even if they have had a glimpse of a few stars, or even of the earth crescent, what of that? Why should people living inside a planet trouble to observe that sort of thing? Men wouldn't have done it except for the seasons and sailing; why should the moon people?...  "Well, suppose there are a few philosophers like yourself. They are just the very Selenites who'll never have heard of our existence. Suppose a Selenite had dropped on the earth when you were at Lympne, you'd have been the last man in the world to hear he had come. You never read a newspaper! You see the chances against you. Well, it's for these chances we're sitting here doing nothing while precious time is flying. I tell you we've got into a fix. We've come unarmed, we've lost our sphere, we've got no food, we've shown ourselves to the Selenites, and made them think we're strange, strong, dangerous animals; and unless these Selenites are perfect fools, they'll set about now and hunt us till they find us, and when they find us they'll try to take us if they can, and kill us if they can't, and that's the end of the matter. If they take us, they'll probably kill us, through some misunderstanding. After we're done for, they may discuss us perhaps, but we shan't get much fun out of that."  "Go on."  "On the other hand, here's gold knocking about like cast iron at home. If only we can get some of it back, if only we can find our sphere again before they do, and get back, then--"  "Yes?"  "We might put the thing on a sounder footing. Come back in a bigger sphere with guns."  "Good Lord!" cried Cavor, as though that was horrible.  I shied another luminous fungus down the cleft.  "Look here, Cavor," I said, "I've half the voting power anyhow in this affair, and this is a case for a practical man. I'm a practical man, and you are not. I'm not going to trust to Selenites and geometrical diagrams if I can help it. That's all. Get back. Drop all this secrecy--or most of it. And come again."  He reflected. "When I came to the moon," he said, "I ought to have come alone."  "The question before the meeting," I said, "is how to get back to the sphere."  For a time we nursed our knees in silence. Then he seemed to decide for my reasons.  "I think," he said, "one can get data. It is clear that while the sun is on this side of the moon the air will be blowing through this planet sponge from the dark side hither. On this side, at any rate, the air will be expanding and flowing out of the moon caverns into the craters.... Very well, there's a draught here."  "So there is."  "And that means that this is not a dead end; somewhere behind us this cleft goes on and up. The draught is blowing up, and that is the way we have to go. If we try to get up any sort of chimney or gully there is, we shall not only get out of these passages where they are hunting for us--"  "But suppose the gully is too narrow?"  "We'll come down again."  "Ssh!" I said suddenly; "what's that?"  We listened. At first it was an indistinct murmur, and then one picked out the clang of a gong. "They must think we are mooncalves," said I, "to be frightened at that."  "They're coming along that passage," said Cavor.  "They must be."  "They'll not think of the cleft. They'll go past."  I listened again for a space. "This time," I whispered, "they're likely to have some sort of weapon."  Then suddenly I sprang to my feet. "Good heavens, Cavor!" I cried. "But they will! They'll see the fungi I have been pitching down. They'll--"  I didn't finish my sentence. I turned about and made a leap over the fungus tops towards the upper end of the cavity. I saw that the space turned upward and became a draughty cleft again, ascending to impenetrable darkness. I was about to clamber up into this, and then with a happy inspiration turned back.  "What are you doing?" asked Cavor.  "Go on!" said I, and went back and got two of the shining fungi, and putting one into the breast pocket of my flannel jacket, so that it stuck out to light our climbing, went back with the other for Cavor. The noise of the Selenites was now so loud that it seemed they must be already beneath the cleft. But it might be they would have difficulty in clambering in to it, or might hesitate to ascend it against our possible resistance. At any rate, we had now the comforting knowledge of the enormous muscular superiority our birth in another planet gave us. In other minute I was clambering with gigantic vigour after Cavor's blue-lit heels.      Chapter 17     The Fight in the Cave of the Moon Butchers  I do not know how far we clambered before we came to the grating. It may be we ascended only a few hundred feet, but at the time it seemed to me we might have hauled and jammed and hopped and wedged ourselves through a mile or more of vertical ascent. Whenever I recall that time, there comes into my head the heavy clank of our golden chains that followed every movement. Very soon my knuckles and knees were raw, and I had a bruise on one cheek. After a time the first violence of our efforts diminished, and our movements became more deliberate and less painful. The noise of the pursuing Selenites had died away altogether. It seemed almost as though they had not traced us up the crack after all, in spite of the tell-tale heap of broken fungi that must have lain beneath it. At times the cleft narrowed so much that we could scarce squeeze up it; at others it expanded into great drusy cavities, studded with prickly crystals or thickly beset with dull, shining fungoid pimples. Sometimes it twisted spirally, and at other times slanted down nearly to the horizontal direction. Ever and again there was the intermittent drip and trickle of water by us. Once or twice it seemed to us that small living things had rustled out of our reach, but what they were we never saw. They may have been venomous beasts for all I know, but they did us no harm, and we were now tuned to a pitch when a weird creeping thing more or less mattered little. And at last, far above, came the familiar bluish light again, and then we saw that it filtered through a grating that barred our way.  We whispered as we pointed this out to one another, and became more and more cautious in our ascent. Presently we were close under the grating, and by pressing my face against its bars I could see a limited portion of the cavern beyond. It was clearly a large space, and lit no doubt by some rivulet of the same blue light that we had seen flow from the beating machinery. An intermittent trickle of water dropped ever and again between the bars near my face.  My first endeavour was naturally to see what might be upon the floor of the cavern, but our grating lay in a depression whose rim hid all this from our eyes. Our foiled attention then fell back upon the suggestion of the various sounds we heard, and presently my eye caught a number of faint shadows that played across the dim roof far overhead.  Indisputably there were several Selenites, perhaps a considerable number, in this space, for we could hear the noises of their intercourse, and faint sounds that I identified as their footfalls. There was also a succession of regularly repeated sounds--chid, chid, chid--which began and ceased, suggestive of a knife or spade hacking at some soft substance. Then came a clank as if of chains, a whistle and a rumble as of a truck running over a hollowed place, and then again that chid, chid, chid resumed. The shadows told of shapes that moved quickly and rhythmically, in agreement with that regular sound, and rested when it ceased.  We put our heads close together, and began to discuss these things in noiseless whispers.  "They are occupied," I said, "they are occupied in some way."  "Yes."  "They're not seeking us, or thinking of us."  "Perhaps they have not heard of us."  "Those others are hunting about below. If suddenly we appeared here--"  We looked at one another.  "There might be a chance to parley," said Cavor.  "No," I said. "Not as we are."  For a space we remained, each occupied by his own thoughts.  Chid, chid, chid went the chipping, and the shadows moved to and fro.  I looked at the grating. "It's flimsy," I said. "We might bend two of the bars and crawl through."  We wasted a little time in vague discussion. Then I took one of the bars in both hands, and got my feet up against the rock until they were almost on a level with my head, and so thrust against the bar. It bent so suddenly that I almost slipped. I clambered about and bent the adjacent bar in the opposite direction, and then took the luminous fungus from my pocket and dropped it down the fissure.  "Don't do anything hastily," whispered Cavor, as I twisted myself up through the opening I had enlarged. I had a glimpse of busy figures as I came through the grating, and immediately bent down, so that the rim of the depression in which the grating lay hid me from their eyes, and so lay flat, signalling advice to Cavor as he also prepared to come through. Presently we were side by side in the depression, peering over the edge at the cavern and its occupants.  It was a much larger cavern than we had supposed from our first glimpse of it, and we looked up from the lowest portion of its sloping floor. It widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid the remoter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length, vanishing at last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a number of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were busy. At first they seemed big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted the heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and skinless like the heads of sheep at a butcher's, and perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler might cut up a moored whale. They were cutting off the flesh in strips, and on some of the farther trunks the white ribs were showing. It was the sound of their hatchets that made that chid, chid, chid. Some way away a thing like a trolley cable, drawn and loaded with chunks of lax meat, was running up the slope of the cavern floor. This enormous long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the moon world second only to the effect of our first glimpse down the shaft.  It seemed to me at first that the Selenites must be standing on trestle-supported planks,[*] and then I saw that the planks and supports and the hatchets were really of the same leaden hue as my fetters had seemed before white light came to bear on them. A number of very thick-looking crowbars lay about the floor, and had apparently assisted to turn the dead mooncalf over on its side. They were perhaps six feet long, with shaped handles, very tempting-looking weapons. The whole place was lit by three transverse streams of the blue fluid.  [* Footnote: I do not remember seeing any wooden things on the moon; doors tables, everything corresponding to our terrestrial joinery was made of metal, and I believe for the most part of gold, which as a metal would, of course, naturally recommend itself--other things being equal--on account of the ease in working it, and its toughness and durability.]  We lay for a long time noting all these things in silence. "Well?" said Cavor at last.  I crouched over and turned to him. I had come upon a brilliant idea. "Unless they lowered those bodies by a crane," I said, "we must be nearer the surface than I thought."  "Why?"  "The mooncalf doesn't hop, and it hasn't got wings."  He peered over the edge of the hollow again. "I wonder now--" he began. "After all, we have never gone far from the surface--"  I stopped him by a grip on his arm. I had heard a noise from the cleft below us!  We twisted ourselves about, and lay as still as death, with every sense alert. In a little while I did not doubt that something was quietly ascending the cleft. Very slowly and quite noiselessly I assured myself of a good grip on my chain, and waited for that something to appear.  "Just look at those chaps with the hatchets again," I said.  "They're all right," said Cavor.  I took a sort of provisional aim at the gap in the grating. I could hear now quite distinctly the soft twittering of the ascending Selenites, the dab of their hands against the rock, and the falling of dust from their grips as they clambered.  Then I could see that there was something moving dimly in the blackness below the grating, but what it might be I could not distinguish. The whole thing seemed to hang fire just for a moment--then smash! I had sprung to my feet, struck savagely at something that had flashed out at me. It was the keen point of a spear. I have thought since that its length in the narrowness of the cleft must have prevented its being sloped to reach me. Anyhow, it shot out from the grating like the tongue of a snake, and missed and flew back and flashed again. But the second time I snatched and caught it, and wrenched it away, but not before another had darted ineffectually at me.  I shouted with triumph as I felt the hold of the Selenite resist my pull for a moment and give, and then I was jabbing down through the bars, amidst squeals from the darkness, and Cavor had snapped off the other spear, and was leaping and flourishing it beside me, and making inefficient jabs. Clang, clang, came up through the grating, and then an axe hurtled through the air and whacked against the rocks beyond, to remind me of the fleshers at the carcasses up the cavern.  I turned, and they were all coming towards us in open order waving their axes. They were short, thick, little beggars, with long arms, strikingly different from the ones we had seen before. If they had not heard of us before, they must have realised the situation with incredible swiftness. I stared at them for a moment, spear in hand. "Guard that grating, Cavor," I cried, howled to intimidate them, and rushed to meet them. Two of them missed with their hatchets, and the rest fled incontinently. Then the two also were sprinting away up the cavern, with hands clenched and heads down. I never saw men run like them!  I knew the spear I had was no good for me. It was thin and flimsy, only effectual for a thrust, and too long for a quick recover. So I only chased the Selenites as far as the first carcass, and stopped there and picked up one of the crowbars that were lying about. It felt comfortingly heavy, and equal to smashing any number of Selenites. I threw away my spear, and picked up a second crowbar for the other hand. I felt five times better than I had with the spear. I shook the two threateningly at the Selenites, who had come to a halt in a little crowd far away up the cavern, and then turned about to look at Cavor.  He was leaping from side to side of the grating, making threatening jabs with his broken spear. That was all right. It would keep the Selenites down--for a time at any rate. I looked up the cavern again. What on earth were we going to do now?  We were cornered in a sort of way already. But these butchers up the cavern had been surprised, they were probably scared, and they had no special weapons, only those little hatchets of theirs. And that way lay escape. Their sturdy little forms--ever so much shorter and thicker than the mooncalf herds--were scattered up the slope in a way that was eloquent of indecision. I had the moral advantage of a mad bull in a street. But for all that, there seemed a tremendous crowd of them. Very probably there was. Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears. It might be they had other surprises for us.... But, confound it! if we charged up the cave we should let them up behind us, and if we didn't those little brutes up the cave would probably get reinforced. Heaven alone knew what tremendous engines of warfare--guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not presently send up to our destruction. It became clear the only thing to do was to charge! It became clearer as the legs of a number of fresh Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us.  "Bedford!" cried Cavor, and behold! he was halfway between me and the grating.  "Go back!" I cried. "What are you doing--"  "They've got--it's like a gun!"  And struggling in the grating between those defensive spears appeared the head and shoulders of a singularly lean and angular Selenite, bearing some complicated apparatus.  I realised Cavor's utter incapacity for the fight we had in hand. For a moment I hesitated. Then I rushed past him whirling my crowbars, and shouting to confound the aim of the Selenite. He was aiming in the queerest way with the thing against his stomach. "Chuzz!" The thing wasn't a gun; it went off like cross-bow more, and dropped me in the middle of a leap.  I didn't fall down, I simply came down a little shorter than I should have done if I hadn't been hit, and from the feel of my shoulder the thing might have tapped me and glanced off. Then my left hand hit again the shaft, and I perceived there was a sort of spear sticking half through my shoulder. The moment after I got home with the crowbar in my right hand, and hit the Selenite fair and square. He collapsed--he crushed and crumpled--his head smashed like an egg.  I dropped a crowbar, pulled the spear out of my shoulder, and began to jab it down the grating into the darkness. At each jab came a shriek and twitter. Finally I hurled the spear down upon them with all my strength, leapt up, picked up the crowbar again, and started for the multitude up the cavern.  "Bedford!" cried Cavor. "Bedford!" as I flew past him.  I seem to remember his footsteps coming on behind me.  Step, leap ... whack, step, leap.... Each leap seemed to last ages. With each, the cave opened out and the number of Selenites visible increased. At first they seemed all running about like ants in a disturbed ant-hill, one or two waving hatchets and coming to meet me, more running away, some bolting sideways into the avenue of carcasses, then presently others came in sight carrying spears, and then others. I saw a most extraordinary thing, all hands and feet, bolting for cover. The cavern grew darker farther up.  Flick! something flew over my head. Flick! As I soared in mid-stride I saw a spear hit and quiver in one of the carcasses to my left. Then, as I came down, one hit the ground before me, and I heard the remote chuzz! with which their things were fired. Flick, flick! for a moment it was a shower. They were volleying!  I stopped dead.  I don't think I thought clearly then. I seem to remember a kind of stereotyped phrase running through my mind: "Zone of fire, seek cover!" I know I made a dash for the space between two of the carcasses, and stood there panting and feeling very wicked.  I looked round for Cavor, and for a moment it seemed as if he had vanished from the world. Then he came out of the darkness between the row of the carcasses and the rocky wall of the cavern. I saw his little face, dark and blue, and shining with perspiration and emotion.  He was saying something, but what it was I did not heed. I had realised that we might work from mooncalf to mooncalf up the cave until we were near enough to charge home. It was charge or nothing. "Come on!" I said, and led the way.  "Bedford!" he cried unavailingly.  My mind was busy as we went up that narrow alley between the dead bodies and the wall of the cavern. The rocks curved about--they could not enfilade us. Though in that narrow space we could not leap, yet with our earth-born strength we were still able to go very much faster than the Selenites. I reckoned we should presently come right among them. Once we were on them, they would be nearly as formidable as black beetles. Only there would first of all be a volley. I thought of a stratagem. I whipped off my flannel jacket as I ran.  "Bedford!" panted Cavor behind me.  I glanced back. "What?" said I.  He was pointing upward over the carcasses. "White light!" he said. "White light again!"  I looked, and it was even so; a faint white ghost of light in the remoter cavern roof. That seemed to give me double strength.  "Keep close," I said. A flat, long Selenite dashed out of the darkness, and squealed and fled. I halted, and stopped Cavor with my hand. I hung my jacket over my crowbar, ducked round the next carcass, dropped jacket and crowbar, showed myself, and darted back.  "Chuzz-flick," just one arrow came. We were close on the Selenites, and they were standing in a crowd, broad, short, and tall together, with a little battery of their shooting implements pointing down the cave. Three or four other arrows followed the first, then their fire ceased.  I stuck out my head, and escaped by a hair's-breadth. This time I drew a dozen shots or more, and heard the Selenites shouting and twittering as if with excitement as they shot. I picked up jacket and crowbar again.  "Now!" said I, and thrust out the jacket.  "Chuzz-zz-zz-zz! Chuzz!" In an instant my jacket had grown a thick beard of arrows, and they were quivering all over the carcass behind us. Instantly I slipped the crowbar out of the jacket, dropped the jacket--for all I know to the contrary it is lying up there in the moon now--and rushed out upon them.  For a minute perhaps it was massacre. I was too fierce to discriminate, and the Selenites were probably too scared to fight. At any rate they made no sort of fight against me. I saw scarlet, as the saying is. I remember I seemed to be wading among those leathery, thin things as a man wades through tall grass, mowing and hitting, first right, then left; smash. Little drops of moisture flew about. I trod on things that crushed and piped and went slippery. The crowd seemed to open and close and flow like water. They seemed to have no combined plan whatever. There were spears flew about me, I was grazed over the ear by one. I was stabbed once in the arm and once in the cheek, but I only found that out afterwards, when the blood had had time to run and cool and feel wet.  What Cavor did I do not know. For a space it seemed that this fighting had lasted for an age, and must needs go on for ever. Then suddenly it was all over, and there was nothing to be seen but the backs of heads bobbing up and down as their owners ran in all directions.... I seemed altogether unhurt. I ran forward some paces, shouting, then turned about. I was amazed.  I had come right through them in vast flying strides, they were all behind me, and running hither and thither to hide.  I felt an enormous astonishment at the evaporation of the great fight into which I had hurled myself, and not a little exultation. It did not seem to me that I had discovered the Selenites were unexpectedly flimsy, but that I was unexpectedly strong. I laughed stupidly. This fantastic moon!  I glanced for a moment at the smashed and writhing bodies that were scattered over the cavern floor, with a vague idea of further violence, then hurried on after Cavor.      Chapter 18     In the Sunlight  Presently we saw that the cavern before us opened upon a hazy void. In another moment we had emerged upon a sort of slanting gallery, that projected into a vast circular space, a huge cylindrical pit running vertically up and down. Round this pit the slanting gallery ran without any parapet or protection for a turn and a half, and then plunged high above into the rock again. Somehow it reminded me then one of those spiral turns of the railway through the Saint Gothard. It was all tremendously huge. I can scarcely hope to convey to you the Titanic proportion of all that place, the Titanic effect of it. Our eyes followed up the vast declivity of the pit wall, and overhead and far above we beheld a round opening set with faint stars, and half of the lip about it well nigh blinding with the white light of the sun. At that we cried aloud simultaneously.  "Come on!" I said, leading the way.  "But there?" said Cavor, and very carefully stepped nearer the edge of the gallery. I followed his example, and craned forward and looked down, but I was dazzled by that gleam of light above, and I could see only a bottomless darkness with spectral patches of crimson and purple floating therein. Yet if I could not see, I could hear. Out of this darkness came a sound, a sound like the angry hum one can hear if one puts one's ear outside a hive of bees, a sound out of that enormous hollow, it may be, four miles beneath our feet...  For a moment I listened, then tightened my grip on my crowbar, and led the way up the gallery.  "This must be the shaft we looked down upon," said Cavor. "Under that lid."  "And below there, is where we saw the lights."  "The lights!" said he. "Yes--the lights of the world that now we shall never see."  "We'll come back," I said, for now we had escaped so much I was rashly sanguine that we should recover the sphere.  His answer I did not catch.  "Eh?" I asked.  "It doesn't matter," he answered, and we hurried on in silence.  I suppose that slanting lateral way was four or five miles long, allowing for its curvature, and it ascended at a slope that would have made it almost impossibly steep on earth, but which one strode up easily under lunar conditions. We saw only two Selenites during all that portion of our flight, and directly they became aware of us they ran headlong. It was clear that the knowledge of our strength and violence had reached them. Our way to the exterior was unexpectedly plain. The spiral gallery straightened into a steeply ascendent tunnel, its floor bearing abundant traces of the mooncalves, and so straight and short in proportion to its vast arch, that no part of it was absolutely dark. Almost immediately it began to lighten, and then far off and high up, and quite blindingly brilliant, appeared its opening on the exterior, a slope of Alpine steepness surmounted by a crest of bayonet shrub, tall and broken down now, and dry and dead, in spiky silhouette against the sun.  And it is strange that we men, to whom this very vegetation had seemed so weird and horrible a little time ago, should now behold it with the emotion a home-coming exile might feel at sight of his native land. We welcomed even the rareness of the air that made us pant as we ran, and which rendered speaking no longer the easy thing that it had been, but an effort to make oneself heard. Larger grew the sunlit circle above us, and larger, and all the nearer tunnel sank into a rim of indistinguishable black. We saw the dead bayonet shrub no longer with any touch of green in it, but brown and dry and thick, and the shadow of its upper branches high out of sight made a densely interlaced pattern upon the tumbled rocks. And at the immediate mouth of the tunnel was a wide trampled space where the mooncalves had come and gone.  We came out upon this space at last into a light and heat that hit and pressed upon us. We traversed the exposed area painfully, and clambered up a slope among the scrub stems, and sat down at last panting in a high place beneath the shadow of a mass of twisted lava. Even in the shade the rock felt hot.  The air was intensely hot, and we were in great physical discomfort, but for all that we were no longer in a nightmare. We seemed to have come to our own province again, beneath the stars. All the fear and stress of our flight through the dim passages and fissures below had fallen from us. That last fight had filled us with an enormous confidence in ourselves so far as the Selenites were concerned. We looked back almost incredulously at the black opening from which we had just emerged. Down there it was, in a blue glow that now in our memories seemed the next thing to absolute darkness, we had met with things like mad mockeries of men, helmet-headed creatures, and had walked in fear before them, and had submitted to them until we could submit no longer. And behold, they had smashed like wax and scattered like chaff, and fled and vanished like the creatures of a dream!  I rubbed my eyes, doubting whether we had not slept and dreamt these things by reason of the fungus we had eaten, and suddenly discovered the blood upon my face, and then that my shirt was sticking painfully to my shoulder and arm.  "Confound it!" I said, gauging my injuries with an investigatory hand, and suddenly that distant tunnel mouth became, as it were, a watching eye.  "Cavor!" I said; "what are they going to do now? And what are we going to do?"  He shook his head, with his eyes fixed upon the tunnel. "How can one tell what they will do?"  "It depends on what they think of us, and I don't see how we can begin to guess that. And it depends upon what they have in reserve. It's as you say, Cavor, we have touched the merest outside of this world. They may have all sorts of things inside here. Even with those shooting things they might make it bad for us....  "Yet after all," I said, "even if we don't find the sphere at once, there is a chance for us. We might hold out. Even through the night. We might go down there again and make a fight for it."  I stared about me with speculative eyes. The character of the scenery had altered altogether by reason of the enormous growth and subsequent drying of the scrub. The crest on which we sat was high, and commanded a wide prospect of the crater landscape, and we saw it now all sere and dry in the late autumn of the lunar afternoon. Rising one behind the other were long slopes and fields of trampled brown where the mooncalves had pastured, and far away in the full blaze of the sun a drove of them basked slumberously, scattered shapes, each with a blot of shadow against it like sheep on the side of a down. But never a sign of a Selenite was to be seen. Whether they had fled on our emergence from the interior passages, or whether they were accustomed to retire after driving out the mooncalves, I cannot guess. At the time I believed the former was the case.  "If we were to set fire to all this stuff," I said, "we might find the sphere among the ashes."  Cavor did not seem to hear me. He was peering under his hand at the stars, that still, in spite of the intense sunlight, were abundantly visible in the sky. "How long do you think we've have been here?" he asked at last.  "Been where?"  "On the moon."  "Two earthly days, perhaps."  "More nearly ten. Do you know, the sun is past its zenith, and sinking in the west. In four days' time or less it will be night."  "But--we've only eaten once!"  "I know that. And-- But there are the stars!"  "But why should time seem different because we are on a smaller planet?"  "I don't know. There it is!"  "How does one tell time?"  "Hunger--fatigue--all those things are different. Everything is different--everything. To me it seems that since first we came out of the sphere has been only a question of hours--long hours--at most."  "Ten days," I said; "that leaves--" I looked up at the sun for a moment, and then saw that it was halfway from the zenith to the western edge of things. "Four days! ... Cavor, we mustn't sit here and dream. How do you think we may begin?"  I stood up. "We must get a fixed point we can recognise--we might hoist a flag, or a handkerchief, or something--and quarter the ground, and work round that."  He stood up beside me.  "Yes," he said, "there is nothing for it but to hunt the sphere. Nothing. We may find it--certainly we may find it. And if not--"  "We must keep on looking."  He look this way and that, glanced up at the sky and down at the tunnel, and astonished me by a sudden gesture of impatience. "Oh! but we have done foolishly! To have come to this pass! Think how it might have been, and the things we might have done!"  "We might do something yet."  "Never the thing we might have done. Here below out feet is a world. Think of what that world must be! Think of that machine we saw, and the lid and the shaft! They were just remote outlying things, and those creatures we have seen and fought with no more than ignorant peasants, dwellers in the outskirts, yokels and labourers half akin to brutes. Down below! Caverns beneath caverns, tunnels, structures, ways... It must open out, and be greater and wider and more populous as one descends. Assuredly. Right down at the last the central sea that washes round the core of the moon. Think of its inky waters under the spare lights--if, indeed, their eyes need lights! Think of the cascading tributaries pouring down their channels to feed it! Think of the tides upon its surface, and the rush and swirl of its ebb and flow! perhaps they have ships that go upon it, perhaps down there are mighty cities and swarming ways, and wisdom and order passing the wit of man. And we may die here upon it, and never see the masters who must be--ruling over these things! We may freeze and die here, and the air will freeze and thaw upon us, and then--! Then they will come upon us, come on our stiff and silent bodies, and find the sphere we cannot find, and they will understand at last too late all the thought and effort that ended here in vain!"  His voice for all that speech sounded like the voice of someone heard in a telephone, weak and far away.  "But the darkness," I said.  "One might get over that."  "How?"  "I don't know. How am I to know? One might carry a torch, one might have a lamp-- The others--might understand."  He stood for a moment with his hands held down and a rueful face, staring out over the waste that defied him. Then with a gesture of renunciation he turned towards me with proposals for the systematic hunting of the sphere.  "We can return," I said.  He looked about him. "First of all we shall have to get to earth."  "We could bring back lamps to carry and climbing irons, and a hundred necessary things."  "Yes," he said.  "We can take back an earnest of success in this gold."  He looked at my golden crowbars, and said nothing for a space. He stood with his hands clasped behind his back, staring across the crater. At last he signed and spoke. "It was I found the way here, but to find a way isn't always to be master of a way. If I take my secret back to earth, what will happen? I do not see how I can keep my secret for a year, for even a part of a year. Sooner or later it must come out, even if other men rediscover it. And then ... Governments and powers will struggle to get hither, they will fight against one another, and against these moon people; it will only spread warfare and multiply the occasions of war. In a little while, in a very little while, if I tell my secret, this planet to its deepest galleries will be strewn with human dead. Other things are doubtful, but that is certain. It is not as though man had any use for the moon. What good would the moon be to men? Even of their own planet what have they made but a battle-ground and theatre of infinite folly? Small as his world is, and short as his time, he has still in his little life down there far more than he can do. No! Science has toiled too long forging weapons for fools to use. It is time she held her hand. Let him find it out for himself again--in a thousand years' time."  "There are methods of secrecy," I said.  He looked up at me and smiled. "After all," he said, "why should one worry? There is little chance of our finding the sphere, and down below things are brewing. It's simply the human habit of hoping till we die that makes us think of return. Our troubles are only beginning. We have shown these moon folk violence, we have given them a taste of our quality, and our chances are about as good as a tiger's that has got loose and killed a man in Hyde Park. The news of us must be running down from gallery to gallery, down towards the central parts.... No sane beings will ever let us take that sphere back to earth after so much as they have seen of us."  "We aren't improving our chances," said I, "by sitting here."  We stood up side by side.  "After all," he said, "we must separate. We must stick up a handkerchief on these tall spikes here and fasten it firmly, and from this as a centre we must work over the crater. You must go westward, moving out in semicircles to and fro towards the setting sun. You must move first with your shadow on your right until it is at right angles with the direction of your handkerchief, and then with your shadow on your left. And I will do the same to the east. We will look into every gully, examine every skerry of rocks; we will do all we can to find my sphere. If we see the Selenites we will hide from them as well as we can. For drink we must take snow, and if we feel the need of food, we must kill a mooncalf if we can, and eat such flesh as it has--raw--and so each will go his own way."  "And if one of us comes upon the sphere?"  "He must come back to the white handkerchief, and stand by it and signal to the other."  "And if neither?"  Cavor glanced up at the sun. "We go on seeking until the night and cold overtake us."  "Suppose the Selenites have found the sphere and hidden it?"  He shrugged his shoulders.  "Or if presently they come hunting us?"  He made no answer.  "You had better take a club," I said.  He shook his head, and stared away from me across the waste.  But for a moment he did not start. He looked round at me shyly, hesitated. "Au revoir," he said.  I felt an odd stab of emotion. A sense of how we had galled each other, and particularly how I must have galled him, came to me. "Confound it," thought I, "we might have done better!" I was on the point of asking him to shake hands--for that, somehow, was how I felt just then--when he put his feet together and leapt away from me towards the north. He seemed to drift through the air as a dead leaf would do, fell lightly, and leapt again. I stood for a moment watching him, then faced westward reluctantly, pulled myself together, and with something of the feeling of a man who leaps into icy water, selected a leaping point, and plunged forward to explore my solitary half of the moon world. I dropped rather clumsily among rocks, stood up and looked about me, clambered on to a rocky slab, and leapt again....  When presently I looked for Cavor he was hidden from my eyes, but the handkerchief showed out bravely on its headland, white in the blaze of the sun.  I determined not to lose sight of that handkerchief whatever might betide.      Chapter 19     Mr. Bedford Alone  In a little while it seemed to me as though I had always been alone on the moon. I hunted for a time with a certain intentness, but the heat was still very great, and the thinness of the air felt like a hoop about one's chest. I came presently into a hollow basin bristling with tall, brown, dry fronds about its edge, and I sat down under these to rest and cool. I intended to rest for only a little while. I put down my clubs beside me, and sat resting my chin on my hands. I saw with a sort of colourless interest that the rocks of the basin, where here and there the crackling dry lichens had shrunk away to show them, were all veined and splattered with gold, that here and there bosses of rounded and wrinkled gold projected from among the litter. What did that matter now? A sort of languor had possession of my limbs and mind, I did not believe for a moment that we should ever find the sphere in that vast desiccated wilderness. I seemed to lack a motive for effort until the Selenites should come. Then I supposed I should exert myself, obeying that unreasonable imperative that urges a man before all things to preserve and defend his life, albeit he may preserve it only to die more painfully in a little while.  Why had we come to the moon?  The thing presented itself to me as a perplexing problem. What is this spirit in man that urges him for ever to depart from happiness and security, to toil, to place himself in danger, to risk even a reasonable certainty of death? It dawned upon me up there in the moon as a thing I ought always to have known, that man is not made simply to go about being safe and comfortable and well fed and amused. Almost any man, if you put the thing to him, not in words, but in the shape of opportunities, will show that he knob as much. Against his interest, against his happiness, he is constantly being driven to do unreasonable things. Some force not himself impels him, and go he must. But why? Why? Sitting there in the midst of that useless moon gold, amidst the things of another world, I took count of all my life. Assuming I was to die a castaway upon the moon, I failed altogether to see what purpose I had served. I got no light on that point, but at any rate it was clearer to me than it had ever been in my life before that I was not serving my own purpose, that all my life I had in truth never served the purposes of my private life. Whose purposes, what purposes, was I serving? ... I ceased to speculate on why we had come to the moon, and took a wider sweep. Why had I come to the earth? Why had I a private life at all? ... I lost myself at last in bottomless speculations....  My thoughts became vague and cloudy, no longer leading in definite directions. I had not felt heavy or weary--I cannot imagine one doing so upon the moon--but I suppose I was greatly fatigued. At any rate I slept.  Slumbering there rested me greatly, I think, and the sun was setting and the violence of the heat abating, through all the time I slumbered. When at last I was roused from my slumbers by a remote clamour, I felt active and capable again. I rubbed my eyes and stretched my arms. I rose to my feet--I was a little stiff--and at once prepared to resume my search. I shouldered my golden clubs, one on each shoulder, and went on out of the ravine of the gold-veined rocks.  The sun was certainly lower, much lower than it had been; the air was very much cooler. I perceived I must have slept some time. It seemed to me that a faint touch of misty blueness hung about the western cliff I leapt to a little boss of rock and surveyed the crater. I could see no signs of mooncalves or Selenites, nor could I see Cavor, but I could see my handkerchief far off, spread out on its thicket of thorns. I looked bout me, and then leapt forward to the next convenient view-point.  I beat my round in a semicircle, and back again in a still remoter crescent. It was very fatiguing and hopeless. The air was really very much cooler, and it seemed to me that the shadow under the westward cliff was growing broad. Ever and again I stopped and reconnoitred, but there was no sign of Cavor, no sign of Selenites; and it seemed to me the mooncalves must have been driven into the interior again--I could see none of them. I became more and more desirous of seeing Cavor. The winged outline of the sun had sunk now, until it was scarcely the distance of its diameter from the rim of the sky. I was oppressed by the idea that the Selenites would presently close their lids and valves, and shut us out under the inexorable onrush of the lunar night. It seemed to me high time that he abandoned his search, and that we took counsel together. I felt how urgent it was that we should decide soon upon our course. We had failed to find the sphere, we no longer had time to seek it, and once these valves were closed with us outside, we were lost men. The great night of space would descend upon us--that blackness of the void which is the only absolute death. All my being shrank from that approach. We must get into the moon again, though we were slain in doing it. I was haunted by a vision of our freezing to death, of our hammering with our last strength on the valve of the great pit.  I took no thought any more of the sphere. I thought only of finding Cavor again. I was half inclined to go back into the moon without him, rather than seek him until it was too late. I was already half-way back towards our handkerchief, when suddenly--  I saw the sphere!  I did not find it so much as it found me. It was lying much farther to the westward than I had gone, and the sloping rays of the sinking sun reflected from its glass had suddenly proclaimed its presence in a dazzling beam. For an instant I thought this was some new device of the Selenites against us, and then I understood.  I threw up my arms, shouted a ghostly shout, and set off in vast leaps towards it. I missed one of my leaps and dropped into a deep ravine and twisted my ankle, and after that I stumbled at almost every leap. I was in a state of hysterical agitation, trembling violently, and quite breathless long before I got to it. Three times at least I had to stop with my hands resting on my side and in spite of the thin dryness of the air, the perspiration was wet upon my face.  I thought of nothing but the sphere until I reached it, I forgot even my trouble of Cavor's whereabouts. My last leap flung me with my hands hard against its glass; then I lay against it panting, and trying vainly to shout, "Cavor! here is the sphere!" When I had recovered a little I peered through the thick glass, and the things inside seemed tumbled. I stooped to peer closer. Then I attempted to get in. I had to hoist it over a little to get my head through the manhole. The screw stopper was inside, and I could see now that nothing had been touched, nothing had suffered. It lay there as we had left it when we had dropped out amidst the snow. For a time I was wholly occupied in making and remaking this inventory. I found I was trembling violently. It was good to see that familiar dark interior again! I cannot tell you how good. Presently I crept inside and sat down among the things. I looked through the glass at the moon world and shivered. I placed my gold clubs upon the table, and sought out and took a little food; not so much because I wanted it, but because it was there. Then it occurred to me that it was time to go out and signal for Cavor. But I did not go out and signal for Cavor forthwith. Something held me to the sphere.  After all, everything was coming right. There would be still time for us to get more of the magic stone that gives one mastery over men. Away there, close handy, was gold for the picking up; and the sphere would travel as well half full of gold as though it were empty. We could go back now, masters of ourselves and our world, and then--  I roused myself at last, and with an effort got myself out of the sphere. I shivered as I emerged, for the evening air was growing very cold. I stood in the hollow staring about me. I scrutinised the bushes round me very carefully before I leapt to the rocky shelf hard by, and took once more what had been my first leap in the moon. But now I made it with no effort whatever.  The growth and decay of the vegetation had gone on apace, and the whole aspect of the rocks had changed, but still it was possible to make out the slope on which the seeds had germinated, and the rocky mass from which we had taken our first view of the crater. But the spiky shrub on the slope stood brown and sere now, and thirty feet high, and cast long shadows that stretched out of sight, and the little seeds that clustered in its upper branches were brown and ripe. Its work was done, and it was brittle and ready to fall and crumple under the freezing air, so soon as the nightfall came. And the huge cacti, that had swollen as we watched them, had long since burst and scattered their spores to the four quarters of the moon. Amazing little corner in the universe--the landing place of men!  Some day, thought I, I will have an inscription standing there right in the midst of the hollow. It came to me, if only this teeming world within knew of the full import of the moment, how furious its tumult would become!  But as yet it could scarcely be dreaming of the significance of our coming. For if it did, the crater would surely be an uproar of pursuit, instead of as still as death! I looked about for some place from which I might signal Cavor, and saw that same patch of rock to which he had leapt from my present standpoint, still bare and barren in the sun. For a moment I hesitated at going so far from the sphere. Then with a pang of shame at that hesitation, I leapt....  From this vantage point I surveyed the crater again. Far away at the top of the enormous shadow I cast was the little white handkerchief fluttering on the bushes. It was very little and very far, and Cavor was not in sight. It seemed to me that by this time he ought to be looking for me. That was the agreement. But he was nowhere to be seen.  I stood waiting and watching, hands shading my eyes, expecting every moment to distinguish him. Very probably I stood there for quite a long time. I tried to shout, and was reminded of the thinness of the air. I made an undecided step back towards the sphere. But a lurking dread of the Selenites made me hesitate to signal my whereabouts by hoisting one of our sleeping-blankets on to the adjacent scrub. I searched the crater again.  It had an effect of emptiness that chilled me. And it was still. Any sound from the Selenites in the world beneath had died away. It was as still as death. Save for the faint stir of the shrub about me in the little breeze that was rising, there was no sound nor shadow of a sound. And the breeze blew chill.  Confound Cavor!  I took a deep breath. I put my hands to the sides of my mouth. "Cavor!" I bawled, and the sound was like some manikin shouting far away.  I looked at the handkerchief, I looked behind me at the broadening shadow of the westward cliff I looked under my hand at the sun. It seemed to me that almost visibly it was creeping down the sky. I felt I must act instantly if I was to save Cavor. I whipped off my vest and flung it as a mark on the sere bayonets of the shrubs behind me, and then set off in a straight line towards the handkerchief. Perhaps it was a couple of miles away--a matter of a few hundred leaps and strides. I have already told how one seemed to hang through those lunar leaps. In each suspense I sought Cavor, and marvelled why he should be hidden. In each leap I could feel the sun setting behind me. Each time I touched the ground I was tempted to go back.  A last leap and I was in the depression below our handkerchief, a stride, and I stood on our former vantage point within arms' reach of it. I stood up straight and scanned the world about me, between its lengthening bars of shadow. Far away, down a long declivity, was the opening of the tunnel up which we had fled, and my shadow reached towards it, stretched towards it, and touched it, like a finger of the night.  Not a sign of Cavor, not a sound in all the stillness, only the stir and waving of the scrub and of the shadows increased. And suddenly and violently I shivered. "Cav--" I began, and realised once more the uselessness of the human voice in that thin air. Silence. The silence of death.  Then it was my eye caught something--a little thing lying, perhaps fifty yards away down the slope, amidst a litter of bent and broken branches. What was it? I knew, and yet for some reason I would not know. I went nearer to it. It was the little cricket-cap Cavor had worn. I did not touch it, I stood looking at it.  I saw then that the scattered branches about it had been forcibly smashed and trampled. I hesitated, stepped forward, and picked it up.  I stood with Cavor's cap in my hand, staring at the trampled reeds and thorns about me. On some, of them were little smears of something dark, something that I dared not touch. A dozen yards away, perhaps, the rising breeze dragged something into view, something small and vividly white.  It was a little piece of paper crumpled tightly, as though it had been clutched tightly. I picked it up, and on it were smears of red. My eye caught faint pencil marks. I smoothed it out, and saw uneven and broken writing ending at last in a crooked streak up on the paper.  I set myself to decipher this.  "I have been injured about the knee, I think my kneecap is hurt, and I cannot run or crawl," it began--pretty distinctly written.  Then less legibly: "They have been chasing me for some time, and it is only a question of"--the word "time" seemed to have been written here and erased in favour of something illegible--"before they get me. They are beating all about me."  Then the writing became convulsive. "I can hear them," I guessed the tracing meant, and then it was quite unreadable for a space. Then came a little string of words that were quite distinct: "a different sort of Selenite altogether, who appears to be directing the--" The writing became a mere hasty confusion again.  "They have larger brain cases--much larger, and slenderer bodies, and very short legs. They make gentle noises, and move with organized deliberation...  "And though I am wounded and helpless here, their appearance still gives me hope." That was like Cavor. "They have not shot at me or attempted... injury. I intend--"  Then came the sudden streak of the pencil across the paper, and on the back and edges--blood!  And as I stood there stupid, and perplexed, with this dumbfounding relic in my hand, something very soft and light and chill touched my hand for a moment and ceased to be, and then a thing, a little white speck, drifted athwart a shadow. It was a tiny snowflake, the first snowflake, the herald of the night.  I looked up with a start, and the sky had darkened almost to blackness, and was thick with a gathering multitude of coldly watchful stars. I looked eastward, and the light of that shrivelled world was touched with sombre bronze; westward, and the sun robbed now by a thickening white mist of half its heat and splendour, was touching the crater rim, was sinking out of sight, and all the shrubs and jagged and tumbled rocks stood out against it in a bristling disorder of black shapes. Into the great lake of darkness westward, a vast wreath of mist was sinking. A cold wind set all the crater shivering. Suddenly, for a moment, I was in a puff of falling snow, and all the world about me gray and dim.  And then it was I heard, not loud and penetrating as at first, but faint and dim like a dying voice, that tolling, that same tolling that had welcomed the coming of the day: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...  It echoed about the crater, it seemed to throb with the throbbing of the greater stars, the blood-red crescent of the sun's disc sank as it tolled out: Boom!... Boom!... Boom!...  What had happened to Cavor? All through that tolling I stood there stupidly, and at last the tolling ceased.  And suddenly the open mouth of the tunnel down below there, shut like an eye and vanished out of sight.  Then indeed was I alone.  Over me, around me, closing in on me, embracing me ever nearer, was the Eternal; that which was before the beginning, and that which triumphs over the end; that enormous void in which all light and life and being is but the thin and vanishing splendour of a falling star, the cold, the stillness, the silence--the infinite and final Night of space.  The sense of solitude and desolation became the sense of an overwhelming presence that stooped towards me, that almost touched me.  "No," I cried. "No! Not yet! not yet! Wait! Wait! Oh, wait!" My voice went up to a shriek. I flung the crumpled paper from me, scrambled back to the crest to take my bearings, and then, with all the will that was in me, leapt out towards the mark I had left, dim and distant now in the very margin of the shadow.  Leap, leap, leap, and each leap was seven ages.  Before me the pale serpent-girdled section of the sun sank and sank, and the advancing shadow swept to seize the sphere before I could reach it. I was two miles away, a hundred leaps or more, and the air about me was thinning out as it thins under an air-pump, and the cold was gripping at my joints. But had I died, I should have died leaping. Once, and then again my foot slipped on the gathering snow as I leapt and shortened my leap; once I fell short into bushes that crashed and smashed into dusty chips and nothingness, and once I stumbled as I dropped and rolled head over heels into a gully, and rose bruised and bleeding and confused as to my direction.  But such incidents were as nothing to the intervals, those awful pauses when one drifted through the air towards that pouring tide of night. My breathing made a piping noise, and it was as though knives were whirling in my lungs. My heart seemed to beat against the top of my brain. "Shall I reach it? O Heaven! Shall I reach it?"  My whole being became anguish.  "Lie down!" screamed my pain and despair; "lie down!"  The nearer I struggled, the more awfully remote it seemed. I was numb, I stumbled, I bruised and cut myself and did not bleed.  It was in sight.  I fell on all fours, and my lungs whooped.  I crawled. The frost gathered on my lips, icicles hung from my moustache, I was white with the freezing atmosphere.  I was a dozen yards from it. My eyes had become dim. "Lie down!" screamed despair; "lie down!"  I touched it, and halted. "Too late!" screamed despair; "lie down!"  I fought stiffly with it. I was on the manhole lip, a stupefied, half-dead being. The snow was all about me. I pulled myself in. There lurked within a little warmer air.  The snowflakes--the airflakes--danced in about me, as I tried with chilling hands to thrust the valve in and spun it tight and hard. I sobbed. "I will," I chattered in my teeth. And then, with fingers that quivered and felt brittle, I turned to the shutter studs.  As I fumbled with the switches--for I had never controlled them before--I could see dimly through the steaming glass the blazing red streamers of the sinking sun, dancing and flickering through the snowstorm, and the black forms of the scrub thickening and bending and breaking beneath the accumulating snow. Thicker whirled the snow and thicker, black against the light. What if even now the switches overcame me? Then something clicked under my hands, and in an instant that last vision of the moon world was hidden from my eyes. I was in the silence and darkness the inter-planetary sphere.      Chapter 20     Mr. Bedford in Infinite Space  It was almost as though I had been killed. Indeed, I could imagine a man suddenly and violently killed would feel very much as I did. One moment, a passion of agonising existence and fear; the next darkness and stillness, neither light nor life nor sun, moon nor stars, the blank infinite. Although the thing was done by my own act, although I had already tasted this very of effect in Cavor's company, I felt astonished, dumbfounded, and overwhelmed. I seemed to be borne upward into an enormous darkness. My fingers floated off the studs, I hung as if I were annihilated, and at last very softly and gently I came against the bale and the golden chain, and the crowbars that had drifted to the middle of the sphere.  I do not know how long that drifting took. In the sphere of course, even more than on the moon, one's earthly time sense was ineffectual. At the touch of the bale it was as if I had awakened from a dreamless sleep. I immediately perceived that if I wanted to keep awake and alive I must get a light or open a window, so as to get a grip of something with my eyes. And besides, I was cold. I kicked off from the bale, therefore, clawed on to the thin cords within the glass, crawled along until I got to the manhole rim, and so got my bearings for the light and blind studs, took a shove off, and flying once round the bale, and getting a scare from something big and flimsy that was drifting loose, I got my hand on the cord quite close to the studs, and reached them. I lit the little lamp first of all to see what it was I had collided with, and discovered that old copy of _Lloyd's News_ had slipped its moorings, and was adrift in the void. That brought me out of the infinite to my own proper dimensions again. It made me laugh and pant for a time, and suggested the idea of a little oxygen from one of the cylinders. After that I lit the heater until I felt warm, and then I took food. Then I set to work in a very gingerly fashion on the Cavorite blinds, to see if I could guess by any means how the sphere was travelling.  The first blind I opened I shut at once, and hung for a time flattened and blinded by the sunlight that had hit me. After thinking a little I started upon the windows at right angles to this one, and got the huge crescent moon and the little crescent earth behind it, the second time. I was amazed to find how far I was from the moon. I had reckoned that not only should I have little or none of the "kick-off" that the earth's atmosphere had given us at our start, but that the tangential "fly off" of the moon's spin would be at least twenty-eight times less than the earth's. I had expected to discover myself hanging over our crater, and on the edge of the night, but all that was now only a part of the outline of the white crescent that filled the sky. And Cavor--?  He was already infinitesimal.  I tried to imagine what could have happened to him. But at that time I could think of nothing but death. I seemed to see him, bent and smashed at the foot of some interminably high cascade of blue. And all about him the stupid insects stared...  Under the inspiring touch of the drifting newspaper I became practical again for a while. It was quite clear to me that what I had to do was to get back to earth, but as far as I could see I was drifting away from it. Whatever had happened to Cavor, even if he was still alive, which seemed to me incredible after that blood-stained scrap, I was powerless to help him. There he was, living or dead behind the mantle of that rayless night, and there he must remain at least until I could summon our fellow men to his assistance. Should I do that? Something of the sort I had in my mind; to come back to earth if it were possible, and then as maturer consideration might determine, either to show and explain the sphere to a few discreet persons, and act with them, or else to keep my secret, sell my gold, obtain weapons, provisions, and an assistant, and return with these advantages to deal on equal terms with the flimsy people of the moon, to rescue Cavor, if that were still possible, and at any rate to procure a sufficient supply of gold to place my subsequent proceedings on a firmer basis. But that was hoping far; I had first to get back.  I set myself to decide just exactly how the return to earth could be contrived. As I struggled with that problem I ceased to worry about what I should do when I got there. At last my only care was to get back.  I puzzled out at last that my best chance would be to drop back towards the moon as near as I dared in order to gather velocity, then to shut my windows, and fly behind it, and when I was past to open my earthward windows, and so get off at a good pace homeward. But whether I should ever reach the earth by that device, or whether I might not simply find myself spinning about it in some hyperbolic or parabolic curve or other, I could not tell. Later I had a happy inspiration, and by opening certain windows to the moon, which had appeared in the sky in front of the earth, I turned my course aside so as to head off the earth, which it had become evident to me I must pass behind without some such expedient. I did a very great deal of complicated thinking over these problems--for I am no mathematician--and in the end I am certain it was much more my good luck than my reasoning that enabled me to hit the earth. Had I known then, as I know now, the mathematical chances there were against me, I doubt if I should have troubled even to touch the studs to make any attempt. And having puzzled out what I considered to be the thing to do, I opened all my moonward windows, and squatted down--the effort lifted me for a time some feet or so into the air, and I hung there in the oddest way--and waited for the crescent to get bigger and bigger until I felt I was near enough for safety. Then I would shut the windows, fly past the moon with the velocity I had got from it--if I did not smash upon it--and so go on towards the earth.  And that is what I did.  At last I felt my moonward start was sufficient. I shut out the sight of the moon from my eyes, and in a state of mind that was, I now recall, incredibly free from anxiety or any distressful quality, I sat down to begin a vigil in that little speck of matter in infinite space that would last until I should strike the earth. The heater had made the sphere tolerably warm, the air had been refreshed by the oxygen, and except for that faint congestion of the head that was always with me while I was away from earth, I felt entire physical comfort. I had extinguished the light again, lest it should fail me in the end; I was in darkness, save for the earthshine and the glitter of the stars below me. Everything was so absolutely silent and still that I might indeed have been the only being in the universe, and yet, strangely enough, I had no more feeling of loneliness or fear than if I had been lying in bed on earth. Now, this seems all the stranger to me, since during my last hours in that crater of the moon, the sense of my utter loneliness had been an agony....  Incredible as it will seem, this interval of time that I spent in space has no sort of proportion to any other interval of time in my life. Sometimes it seemed as though I sat through immeasurable eternities like some god upon a lotus leaf, and again as though there was a momentary pause as I leapt from moon to earth. In truth, it was altogether some weeks of earthly time. But I had done with care and anxiety, hunger or fear, for that space. I floated, thinking with a strange breadth and freedom of all that we had undergone, and of all my life and motives, and the secret issues of my being. I seemed to myself to have grown greater and greater, to have lost all sense of movement; to be floating amidst the stars, and always the sense of earth's littleness and the infinite littleness of my life upon it, was implicit in my thoughts.  I can't profess to explain the things that happened in my mind. No doubt they could all be traced directly or indirectly to the curious physical conditions under which I was living. I set them down here just for what they are worth, and without any comment. The most prominent quality of it was a pervading doubt of my own identity. I became, if I may so express it, dissociate from Bedford; I looked down on Bedford as a trivial, incidental thing with which I chanced to be connected. I saw Bedford in many relations--as an ass or as a poor beast, where I had hitherto been inclined to regard him with a quiet pride as a very spirited or rather forcible person. I saw him not only as an ass, but as the son of many generations of asses. I reviewed his school-days and his early manhood, and his first encounter with love, very much as one might review the proceedings of an ant in the sand. Something of that period of lucidity I regret still hangs about me, and I doubt if I shall ever recover the full-bodied self satisfaction of my early days. But at the time the thing was not in the least painful, because I had that extraordinary persuasion that, as a matter of fact, I was no more Bedford than I was any one else, but only a mind floating in the still serenity of space. Why should I be disturbed about this Bedford's shortcomings? I was not responsible for him or them.  For a time I struggled against this really very grotesque delusion. I tried to summon the memory of vivid moments, of tender or intense emotions to my assistance; I felt that if I could recall one genuine twinge of feeling the growing severance would be stopped. But I could not do it. I saw Bedford rushing down Chancery Lane, hat on the back of his head, coat tails flying out, en route for his public examination. I saw him dodging and bumping against, and even saluting, other similar little creatures in that swarming gutter of people. Me? I saw Bedford that same evening in the sitting-room of a certain lady, and his hat was on the table beside him, and it wanted brushing badly, and he was in tears. Me? I saw him with that lady in various attitudes and emotions--I never felt so detached before.... I saw him hurrying off to Lympne to write a play, and accosting Cavor, and in his shirt sleeves working at the sphere, and walking out to Canterbury because he was afraid to come! Me? I did not believe it.  I still reasoned that all this was hallucination due to my solitude, and the fact that I had lost all weight and sense of resistance. I endeavoured to recover that sense by banging myself about the sphere, by pinching my hands and clasping them together. Among other things, I lit the light, captured that torn copy of _Lloyd's_, and read those convincingly realistic advertisements about the Cutaway bicycle, and the gentleman of private means, and the lady in distress who was selling those "forks and spoons." There was no doubt _they_ existed surely enough, and, said I, "This is your world, and you are Bedford, and you are going back to live among things like that for all the rest of your life." But the doubts within me could still argue: "It is not you that is reading, it is Bedford, but you are not Bedford, you know. That's just where the mistake comes in."  "Confound it!" I cried; "and if I am not Bedford, what am I?"  But in that direction no light was forthcoming, though the strangest fancies came drifting into my brain, queer remote suspicions, like shadows seen from away. Do you know, I had a sort of idea that really I was something quite outside not only the world, but all worlds, and out of space and time, and that this poor Bedford was just a peephole through which I looked at life? ...  Bedford! However I disavowed him, there I was most certainly bound up with him, and I knew that wherever or whatever I might be, I must needs feel the stress of his desires, and sympathise with all his joys and sorrows until his life should end. And with the dying of Bedford--what then? ...  Enough of this remarkable phase of my experiences! I tell it here simply to show how one's isolation and departure from this planet touched not only the functions and feeling of every organ of the body, but indeed also the very fabric of the mind, with strange and unanticipated disturbances. All through the major portion of that vast space journey I hung thinking of such immaterial things as these, hung dissociated and apathetic, a cloudy megalomaniac, as it were, amidst the stars and planets in the void of space; and not only the world to which I was returning, but the blue-lit caverns of the Selenites, their helmet faces, their gigantic and wonderful machines, and the fate of Cavor, dragged helpless into that world, seemed infinitely minute and altogether trivial things to me.  Until at last I began to feel the pull of the earth upon my being, drawing me back again to the life that is real for men. And then, indeed, it grew clearer and clearer to me that I was quite certainly Bedford after all, and returning after amazing adventures to this world of ours, and with a life that I was very likely to lose in this return. I set myself to puzzle out the conditions under which I must fall to earth.      Chapter 21     Mr. Bedford at Littlestone  My line of flight was about parallel with the surface as I came into the upper air. The temperature of sphere began to rise forthwith. I knew it behoved me to drop at once. Far below me, in a darkling twilight, stretched a great expanse of sea. I opened every window I could, and fell--out of sunshine into evening, and out of evening into night. Vaster grew the earth and vaster, swallowing up the stars, and the silvery translucent starlit veil of cloud it wore spread out to catch me. At last the world seemed no longer a sphere but flat, and then concave. It was no longer a planet in the sky, but the world of Man. I shut all but an inch or so of earthward window, and dropped with a slackening velocity. The broadening water, now so near that I could see the dark glitter of the waves, rushed up to meet me. The sphere became very hot. I snapped the last strip of window, and sat scowling and biting my knuckles, waiting for the impact....  The sphere hit the water with a huge splash: it must have sent it fathoms high. At the splash I flung the Cavorite shutters open. Down I went, but slower and slower, and then I felt the sphere pressing against my feet, and so drove up again as a bubble drives. And at the last I was floating and rocking upon the surface of the sea, and my journey in space was at an end.  The night was dark and overcast. Two yellow pinpoints far away showed the passing of a ship, and nearer was a red glare that came and went. Had not the electricity of my glow-lamp exhausted itself, I could have got picked up that night. In spite of the inordinate fatigue I was beginning to feel, I was excited now, and for a time hopeful, in a feverish, impatient way, that so my travelling might end.  But at last I ceased to move about, and sat, wrists on knees, staring at a distant red light. It swayed up and down, rocking, rocking. My excitement passed. I realised I had yet to spend another night at least in the sphere. I perceived myself infinitely heavy and fatigued. And so I fell asleep.  A change in my rhythmic motion awakened me. I peered through the refracting glass, and saw that I had come aground upon a huge shallow of sand. Far away I seemed to see houses and trees, and seaward a curve, vague distortion of a ship hung between sea and sky.  I stood up and staggered. My one desire was to emerge. The manhole was upward, and I wrestled with the screw. Slowly I opened the manhole. At last the air was singing in again as once it had sung out. But this time I did not wait until the pressure was adjusted. In another moment I had the weight of the window on my hands, and I was open, wide open, to the old familiar sky of earth.  The air hit me on the chest so that I gasped. I dropped the glass screw. I cried out, put my hands to my chest, and sat down. For a time I was in pain. Then I took deep breaths. At last I could rise and move about again.  I tried to thrust my head through the manhole, and the sphere rolled over. It was as though something had lugged my head down directly it emerged. I ducked back sharply, or I should have been pinned face under water. After some wriggling and shoving I managed to crawl out upon sand, over which the retreating waves still came and went.  I did not attempt to stand up. It seemed to me that my body must be suddenly changed to lead. Mother Earth had her grip on me now--no Cavorite intervening. I sat down heedless of the water that came over my feet.  It was dawn, a gray dawn, rather overcast but showing here and there a long patch of greenish gray. Some way out a ship was lying at anchor, a pale silhouette of a ship with one yellow light. The water came rippling in in long shallow waves. Away to the right curved the land, a shingle bank with little hovels, and at last a lighthouse, a sailing mark and a point. Inland stretched a space of level sand, broken here and there by pools of water, and ending a mile away perhaps in a low shore of scrub. To the north-east some isolated watering-place was visible, a row of gaunt lodging-houses, the tallest things that I could see on earth, dull dabs against the brightening sky. What strange men can have reared these vertical piles in such an amplitude of space I do not know. There they are, like pieces of Brighton lost in the waste.  For a long time I sat there, yawning and rubbing my face. At last I struggled to rise. It made me feel that I was lifting a weight. I stood up.  I stared at the distant houses. For the first time since our starvation in the crater I thought of earthly food. "Bacon," I whispered, "eggs. Good toast and good coffee.... And how the devil am I going to all this stuff to Lympne?" I wondered where I was. It was an east shore anyhow, and I had seen Europe before I dropped.  I heard footsteps crunching in the sand, and a little round-faced, friendly-looking man in flannels, with a bathing towel wrapped about his shoulders, and his bathing dress over his arm, appeared up the beach. I knew instantly that I must be in England. He was staring most intently at the sphere and me. He advanced staring. I dare say I looked a ferocious savage enough--dirty, unkempt, to an indescribable degree; but it did not occur to me at the time. He stopped at a distance of twenty yards. "Hul-lo, my man!" he said doubtfully.  "Hullo yourself!" said I.  He advanced, reassured by that. "What on earth is that thing?" he asked.  "Can you tell me where I am?" I asked.  "That's Littlestone," he said, pointing to the houses; "and that's Dungeness! Have you just landed? What's that thing you've got? Some sort of machine?"  "Yes."  "Have you floated ashore? Have you been wrecked or something? What is it?"  I meditated swiftly. I made an estimate of the little man's appearance as he drew nearer. "By Jove!" he said, "you've had a time of it! I thought you-- Well-- Where were you cast away? Is that thing a sort of floating thing for saving life?"  I decided to take that line for the present. I made a few vague affirmatives. "I want help," I said hoarsely. "I want to get some stuff up the beach--stuff I can't very well leave about." I became aware of three other pleasant-looking young men with towels, blazers, and straw hats, coming down the sands towards me. Evidently the early bathing section of this Littlestone.  "Help!" said the young man: "rather!" He became vaguely active. "What particularly do you want done?" He turned round and gesticulated. The three young men accelerated their pace. In a minute they there about me, plying me with questions I was indisposed to answer. "I'll tell all that later," I said. "I'm dead beat. I'm a rag."  "Come up to the hotel," said the foremost little man. "We'll look after that thing there."  I hesitated. "I can't," I said. "In that sphere there's two big bars of gold."  They looked incredulously at one another, then at me with a new inquiry. I went to the sphere, stooped, crept in, and presently they had the Selenites' crowbars and the broken chain before them. If I had not been so horribly fagged I could have laughed at them. It was like kittens round a beetle. They didn't know what to do with the stuff. The fat little man stooped and lifted the end of one of the bars, and then dropped it with a grunt. Then they all did.  "It's lead, or gold!" said one.  "Oh, it's gold!" said another.  "Gold, right enough," said the third.  Then they all stared at me, and then they all stared at the ship lying at anchor.  "I say!" cried the little man. "But where did you get that?"  I was too tired to keep up a lie. "I got it in the moon."  I saw them stare at one another.  "Look here!" said I, "I'm not going to argue now. Help me carry these lumps of gold up to the hotel--I guess, with rests, two of you can manage one, and I'll trail this chain thing--and I'll tell you more when I've had some food."  "And how about that thing?"  "It won't hurt there," I said. "Anyhow--confound it!--it must stop there now. If the tide comes up, it will float all right."  And in a state of enormous wonderment, these young men most obediently hoisted my treasures on their shoulders, and with limbs that felt like lead I headed a sort of procession towards that distant fragment of "sea-front." Half-way there we were reinforced by two awe-stricken little girls with spades, and later a lean little boy, with a penetrating sniff, appeared. He was, I remember, wheeling a bicycle, and he accompanied us at a distance of about a hundred yards on our right flank, and then I suppose, gave us up as uninteresting, mounted his bicycle and rode off over the level sands in the direction of the sphere.  I glanced back after him.  "He won't touch it," said the stout young man reassuringly, and I was only too willing to be reassured.  At first something of the gray of the morning was in my mind, but presently the sun disengaged itself from the level clouds of the horizon and lit the world, and turned the leaden sea to glittering waters. My spirits rose. A sense of the vast importance of the things I had done and had yet to do came with the sunlight into my mind. I laughed aloud as the foremost man staggered under my gold. When indeed I took my place in the world, how amazed the world would be!  If it had not been for my inordinate fatigue, the landlord of the Littlestone hotel would have been amusing, as he hesitated between my gold and my respectable company on the one and my filthy appearance on the other. But at last I found myself in a terrestrial bathroom once more with warm water to wash myself with, and a change of raiment, preposterously small indeed, but anyhow clean, that the genial little man had lent me. He lent me a razor too, but I could not screw up my resolution to attack even the outposts of the bristling beard that covered my face.  I sat down to an English breakfast and ate with a sort of languid appetite--an appetite many weeks old and very decrepit--and stirred myself to answer the questions of the four young men. And I told them the truth.  "Well," said I, "as you press me--I got it in the moon."  "The moon?"  "Yes, the moon in the sky."  "But how do you mean?"  "What I say, confound it!"  "Then you have just come from the moon?"  "Exactly! through space--in that ball." And I took a delicious mouthful of egg. I made a private note that when I went back to the moon I would take a box of eggs.  I could see clearly that they did not believe one word what I told them, but evidently they considered me the most respectable liar they had ever met. They glanced at one another, and then concentrated the fire of their eyes on me. I fancy they expected a clue to me in the way I helped myself to salt. They seemed to find something significant in my peppering my egg. These strangely shaped masses of gold they had staggered under held their minds. There the lumps lay in front of me, each worth thousands of pounds, and as impossible for any one to steal as a house or a piece of land. As I looked at their curious faces over my coffee-cup, I realised something of the enormous wilderness of explanations into which I should have to wander to render myself comprehensible again.  "You don't really mean--" began the youngest young man, in the tone of one who speaks to an obstinate child.  "Just pass me that toast-rack," I said, and shut him up completely.  "But look here, I say," began one of the others. "We're not going to believe that, you know."  "Ah, well," said I, and shrugged my shoulders.  "He doesn't want to tell us," said the youngest young man in a stage aside; and then, with an appearance of great sang-froid, "You don't mind if I take a cigarette?"  I waved him a cordial assent, and proceeded with my breakfast. Two of the others went and looked out of the farther window and talked inaudibly. I was struck by a thought. "The tide," I said, "is running out?"  There was a pause, a doubt who should answer me.  "It's near the ebb," said the fat little man.  "Well, anyhow," I said, "it won't float far."  I decapitated my third egg, and began a little speech. "Look here," I said. "Please don't imagine I'm surly or telling you uncivil lies, or anything of that sort. I'm forced almost, to be a little short and mysterious. I can quite understand this is as queer as it can be, and that your imaginations must be going it. I can assure you, you're in at a memorable time. But I can't make it clear to you now--it's impossible. I give you my word of honour I've come from the moon, and that's all I can tell you.... All the same, I'm tremendously obliged to you, you know, tremendously. I hope that my manner hasn't in any way given you offence."  "Oh, not in the least!" said the youngest young man affably. "We can quite understand," and staring hard at me all the time, he heeled his chair back until it very nearly upset, and recovered with some exertion. "Not a bit of it," said the fat young man.  "Don't you imagine that!" and they all got up and dispersed, and walked about and lit cigarettes, and generally tried to show they were perfectly amiable and disengaged, and entirely free from the slightest curiosity about me and the sphere. "I'm going to keep an eye on that ship out there all the same," I heard one of them remarking in an undertone. If only they could have forced themselves to it, they would, I believe, even have gone out and left me. I went on with my third egg.  "The weather," the fat little man remarked presently, "has been immense, has it not? I don't know when we have had such a summer."  Phoo-whizz! Like a tremendous rocket!  And somewhere a window was broken....  "What's that?" said I.  "It isn't--?" cried the little man, and rushed to the corner window.  All the others rushed to the window likewise. I sat staring at them.  Suddenly I leapt up, knocked over my third egg, rushed for the window also. I had just thought of something. "Nothing to be seen there," cried the little man, rushing for the door.  "It's that boy!" I cried, bawling in hoarse fury; "it's that accursed boy!" and turning about I pushed the waiter aside--he was just bring me some more toast--and rushed violently out of the room and down and out upon the queer little esplanade in front of the hotel.  The sea, which had been smooth, was rough now with hurrying cat's-paws, and all about where the sphere had been was tumbled water like the wake of a ship. Above, a little puff of cloud whirled like dispersing smoke, and the three or four people on the beach were bring up with interrogative faces towards the point of that unexpected report. And that was all! Boots and waiter and the four young men in blazers came rushing out behind me. Shouts came from windows and doors, and all sorts of worrying people came into sight--agape.  For a time I stood there, too overwhelmed by this new development to think of the people.  At first I was too stunned to see the thing as any definite disaster--I was just stunned, as a man is by some accidental violent blow. It is only afterwards he begins to appreciate his specific injury.  "Good Lord!"  I felt as though somebody was pouring funk out of a can down the back of my neck. My legs became feeble. I had got the first intimation of what the disaster meant for me. There was that confounded boy--sky high! I was utterly left. There was the gold in the coffee-room--my only possession on earth. How would it all work out? The general effect was of a gigantic unmanageable confusion.  "I say," said the voice of the little man behind. "I say, you know."  I wheeled about, and there were twenty or thirty people, a sort of irregular investment of people, all bombarding me with dumb interrogation, with infinite doubt and suspicion. I felt the compulsion of their eyes intolerably. I groaned aloud.  "I _can't_," I shouted. "I tell you I can't! I'm not equal to it! You must puzzle and--and be damned to you!"  I gesticulated convulsively. He receded a step as though I had threatened him. I made a bolt through them into the hotel. I charged back into the coffee-room, rang the bell furiously. I gripped the waiter as he entered. "D'ye hear?" I shouted. "Get help and carry these bars up to my room right away."  He failed to understand me, and I shouted and raved at him. A scared-looking little old man in a green apron appeared, and further two of the young men in flannels. I made a dash at them and commandeered their services. As soon as the gold was in my room I felt free to quarrel. "Now get out," I shouted; "all of you get out if you don't want to see a man go mad before your eyes!" And I helped the waiter by the shoulder as he hesitated in the doorway. And then, as soon as I had the door locked on them all, I tore off the little man's clothes again, shied them right and left, and got into bed forthwith. And there I lay swearing and panting and cooling for a very long time.  At last I was calm enough to get out of bed and ring up the round-eyed waiter for a flannel nightshirt, a soda and whisky, and some good cigars. And these things being procured me, after an exasperating delay that drove me several times to the bell, I locked the door again and proceeded very deliberately to look entire situation in the face.  The net result of the great experiment presented itself as an absolute failure. It was a rout, and I was the sole survivor. It was an absolute collapse, and this was the final disaster. There was nothing for it but to save myself, and as much as I could in the way of prospects from our debacle. At one fatal crowning blow all my vague resolutions of return and recovery had vanished. My intention of going back to the moon, of getting a sphereful of gold, and afterwards of having a fragment of Cavorite analysed and so recovering the great secret--perhaps, finally, even of recovering Cavor's body--all these ideas vanished altogether.  I was the sole survivor, and that was all.  I think that going to bed was one of the luckiest ideas I have ever had in an emergency. I really believe I should either have got loose-headed or done some indiscreet thing. But there, locked in and secure from all interruptions, I could think out the position in all its bearings and make my arrangements at leisure.  Of course, it was quite clear to me what had happened to the boy. He had crawled into the sphere, meddled with the studs, shut the Cavorite windows, and gone up. It was highly improbable he had screwed the manhole stopper, and, even if he had, the chances were a thousand to one against his getting back. It was fairly evident that he would gravitate with my bales to somewhere near the middle of the sphere and remain there, and so cease to be a legitimate terrestrial interest, however remarkable he might seem to the inhabitants of some remote quarter of space. I very speedily convinced myself on that point. And as for any responsibility I might have in the matter, the more I reflected upon that, the clearer it became that if only I kept quiet about things, I need not trouble myself about that. If I was faced by sorrowing parents demanding their lost boy, I had merely to demand my lost sphere--or ask them what they meant. At first I had had a vision of weeping parents and guardians, and all sorts of complications; but now I saw that I simply had to keep my mouth shut, and nothing in that way could arise. And, indeed, the more I lay and smoked and thought, the more evident became the wisdom of impenetrability.  It is within the right of every British citizen, provided he does not commit damage nor indecorum, to appear suddenly wherever he pleases, and as ragged and filthy as he pleases, and with whatever amount of virgin gold he sees fit to encumber himself, and no one has any right at all to hinder and detain him in this procedure. I formulated that at last to myself, and repeated it over as a sort of private Magna Charta of my liberty.  Once I had put that issue on one side, I could take up and consider in an equable manner certain considerations I had scarcely dared to think of before, namely, those arising out of the circumstances of my bankruptcy. But now, looking at this matter calmly and at leisure, I could see that if only I suppressed my identity by a temporary assumption of some less well-known name, and if I retained the two months' beard that had grown upon me, the risks of any annoyance from the spiteful creditor to whom I have already alluded became very small indeed. From that to a definite course of rational worldly action was plain sailing. It was all amazingly petty, no doubt, but what was there remaining for me to do?  Whatever I did I was resolved that I would keep myself level and right side up.  I ordered up writing materials, and addressed a letter to the New Romney Bank--the nearest, the waiter informed me--telling the manager I wished to open an account with him, and requesting him to send two trustworthy persons properly authenticated in a cab with a good horse to fetch some hundredweight of gold with which I happened to be encumbered. I signed the letter "Blake," which seemed to me to be a thoroughly respectable sort of name. This done, I got a Folkstone Blue Book, picked out an outfitter, and asked him to send a cutter to measure me for a dark tweed suit, ordering at the same time a valise, dressing bag, brown boots, shirts, hat (to fit), and so forth; and from a watchmaker I also ordered a watch. And these letters being despatched, I had up as good a lunch as the hotel could give, and then lay smoking a cigar, as calm and ordinary as possible, until in accordance with my instructions two duly authenticated clerks came from the bank and weighed and took away my gold. After which I pulled the clothes over my ears in order to drown any knocking, and went very comfortably to sleep.  I went to sleep. No doubt it was a prosaic thing for the first man back from the moon to do, and I can imagine that the young and imaginative reader will find my behaviour disappointing. But I was horribly fatigued and bothered, and, confound it! what else was there to do? There certainly was not the remotest chance of my being believed, if I had told my story then, and it would certainly have subjected me to intolerable annoyances. I went to sleep. When at last I woke up again I was ready to face the world as I have always been accustomed to face it since I came to years of discretion. And so I got away to Italy, and there it is I am writing this story. If the world will not have it as fact, then the world may take it as fiction. It is no concern of mine.  And now that the account is finished, I am amazed to think how completely this adventure is gone and done with. Everybody believes that Cavor was a not very brilliant scientific experimenter who blew up his house and himself at Lympne, and they explain the bang that followed my arrival at Littlestone by a reference to the experiments with explosives that are going on continually at the government establishment of Lydd, two miles away. I must confess that hitherto I have not acknowledged my share in the disappearance of Master Tommy Simmons, which was that little boy's name. That, perhaps, may prove a difficult item of corroboration to explain away. They account for my appearance in rags with two bars of indisputable gold upon the Littlestone beach in various ingenious ways--it doesn't worry me what they think of me. They say I have strung all these things together to avoid being questioned too closely as to the source of my wealth. I would like to see the man who could invent a story that would hold together like this one. Well, they must take it as fiction--there it is.  I have told my story--and now, I suppose, I have to take up the worries of this terrestrial life again. Even if one has been to the moon, one has still to earn a living. So I am working here at Amalfi, on the scenario of that play I sketched before Cavor came walking into my world, and I am trying to piece my life together as it was before ever I saw him. I must confess that I find it hard to keep my mind on the play when the moonshine comes into my room. It is full moon here, and last night I was out on the pergola for hours, staring away at the shining blankness that hides so much. Imagine it! tables and chairs, and trestles and bars of gold! Confound it!--if only one could hit on that Cavorite again! But a thing like that doesn't come twice in a life. Here I am, a little better off than I was at Lympne, and that is all. And Cavor has committed suicide in a more elaborate way than any human being ever did before. So the story closes as finally and completely as a dream. It fits in so little with all the other things of life, so much of it is so utterly remote from all human experience, the leaping, the eating, the breathing, and these weightless times, that indeed there are moments when, in spite of my moon gold, I do more than half believe myself that the whole thing was a dream....      Chapter 22     The Astonishing Communication of Mr. Julius Wendigee  When I had finished my account of my return to the earth at Littlestone, I wrote, "The End," made a flourish, and threw my pen aside, fully believing that the whole story of the First Men in the Moon was done. Not only had I done this, but I had placed my manuscript in the hands of a literary agent, had permitted it to be sold, had seen the greater portion of it appear in the _Strand Magazine_, and was setting to work again upon the scenario of the play I had commenced at Lympne before I realised that the end was not yet. And then, following me from Amalfi to Algiers, there reached me (it is now about six months ago) one of the most astounding communications I have ever been fated to receive. Briefly, it informed me that Mr. Julius Wendigee, a Dutch electrician, who has been experimenting with certain apparatus akin to the apparatus used by Mr. Tesla in America, in the hope of discovering some method of communication with Mars, was receiving day by day a curiously fragmentary message in English, which was indisputably emanating from Mr. Cavor in the moon.  At first I thought the thing was an elaborate practical joke by some one who had seen the manuscript of my narrative. I answered Mr. Wendigee jestingly, but he replied in a manner that put such suspicion altogether aside, and in a state of inconceivable excitement I hurried from Algiers to the little observatory upon the Monte Rosa in which he was working. In the presence of his record and his appliances--and above all of the messages from Cavor that were coming to hand--my lingering doubts vanished. I decided at once to accept a proposal he made to me to remain with him, assisting him to take down the record from day to day, and endeavouring with him to send a message back to the moon. Cavor, we learnt, was not only alive, but free, in the midst of an almost inconceivable community of these ant-like beings, these ant-men, in the blue darkness of the lunar caves. He was lamed, it seemed, but otherwise in quite good health--in better health, he distinctly said, than he usually enjoyed on earth. He had had a fever, but it had left no bad effects. But curiously enough he seemed to be labouring under a conviction that I was either dead in the moon crater or lost in the deep of space.  His message began to be received by Mr. Wendigee when that gentleman was engaged in quite a different investigation. The reader will no doubt recall the little excitement that began the century, arising out an announcement by Mr. Nikola Tesla, the American electrical celebrity, that he had received a message from Mars. His announcement renewed attention to fact that had long been familiar to scientific people, namely: that from some unknown source in space, waves of electromagnetic disturbance, entirely similar those used by Signor Marconi for his wireless telegraphy, are constantly reaching the earth. Besides Tesla quite a number of other observers have been engaged in perfecting apparatus for receiving and recording these vibrations, though few would go so far to consider them actual messages from some extraterrestrial sender. Among that few, however, we must certainly count Mr. Wendigee. Ever since 1898 he had devoted himself almost entirely to this subject, and being a man of ample means he had erected an observatory on the flanks of Monte Rosa, in a position singularly adapted in every way for such observations.  My scientific attainments, I must admit, are not great, but so far as they enable me to judge, Mr. Wendigee's contrivances for detecting and recording any disturbances in the electromagnetic conditions of space are singularly original and ingenious. And by a happy combination of circumstances they were set up and in operation about two months before Cavor made his first attempt to call up the earth. Consequently we have fragments of his communication even from the beginning. Unhappily, they are only fragments, and the most momentous of all the things that he had to tell humanity--the instructions, that is, for the making of Cavorite, if, indeed, he ever transmitted them--have throbbed themselves away unrecorded into space. We never succeeded in getting a response back to Cavor. He was unable to tell, therefore, what we had received or what we had missed; nor, indeed, did he certainly know that any one on earth was really aware of his efforts to reach us. And the persistence he displayed in sending eighteen long descriptions of lunar affairs--as they would be if we had them complete--shows how much his mind must have turned back towards his native planet since he left it two years ago.  You can imagine how amazed Mr. Wendigee must have been when he discovered his record of electromagnetic disturbances interlaced by Cavor's straightforward English. Mr. Wendigee knew nothing of our wild journey moonward, and suddenly--this English out of the void!  It is well the reader should understand the conditions under which it would seem these messages were sent. Somewhere within the moon Cavor certainly had access for a time to a considerable amount of electrical apparatus, and it would seem he rigged up--perhaps furtively--a transmitting arrangement of the Marconi type. This he was able to operate at irregular intervals: sometimes for only half an hour or so, sometimes for three or four hours at a stretch. At these times he transmitted his earthward message, regardless of the fact that the relative position of the moon and points upon the earth's surface is constantly altering. As a consequence of this and of the necessary imperfections of our recording instruments his communication comes and goes in our records in an extremely fitful manner; it becomes blurred; it "fades out" in a mysterious and altogether exasperating way. And added to this is the fact that he was not an expert operator; he had partly forgotten, or never completely mastered, the code in general use, and as he became fatigued he dropped words and misspelt in a curious manner.  Altogether we have probably lost quite half of the communications he made, and much we have is damaged, broken, and partly effaced. In the abstract that follows the reader must be prepared therefore for a considerable amount of break, hiatus, and change of topic. Mr. Wendigee and I are collaborating in a complete and annotated edition of the Cavor record, which we hope to publish, together with a detailed account of the instruments employed, beginning with the first volume in January next. That will be the full and scientific report, of which this is only the popular transcript. But here we give at least sufficient to complete the story I have told, and to give the broad outlines of the state of that other world so near, so akin, and yet so dissimilar to our own.      Chapter 23     An Abstract of the Six Messages First Received from Mr. Cavor  The two earlier messages of Mr. Cavor may very well be reserved for that larger volume. They simply tell, with greater brevity and with a difference in several details that is interesting, but not of any vital importance, the bare facts of the making of the sphere and our departure from the world. Throughout, Cavor speaks of me as a man who is dead, but with a curious change of temper as he approaches our landing on the moon. "Poor Bedford," he says of me, and "this poor young man," and he blames himself for inducing a young man, "by no means well equipped for such adventures," to leave a planet "on which he was indisputably fitted to succeed" on so precarious a mission. I think he underrates the part my energy and practical capacity played in bringing about the realisation of his theoretical sphere. "We arrived," he says, with no more account of our passage through space than if we had made a journey of common occurrence in a railway train.  And then he becomes increasingly unfair to me. Unfair, indeed, to an extent I should not have expected in a man trained in the search for truth. Looking back over my previously written account of these things, I must insist that I have been altogether juster to Cavor than he has been to me. I have extenuated little and suppressed nothing. But his account is:--  "It speedily became apparent that the entire strangeness of our circumstances and surroundings--great loss of weight, attenuated but highly oxygenated air, consequent exaggeration of the results of muscular effort, rapid development of weird plants from obscure spores, lurid sky--was exciting my companion unduly. On the moon his character seemed to deteriorate. He became impulsive, rash, and quarrelsome. In a little while his folly in devouring some gigantic vesicles and his consequent intoxication led to our capture by the Selenites--before we had had the slightest opportunity of properly observing their ways...."  (He says, you observe, nothing of his own concession to these same "vesicles.")  And he goes on from that point to say that "We came to a difficult passage with them, and Bedford mistaking certain gestures of theirs"--pretty gestures they were!--"gave way to a panic violence. He ran amuck, killed three, and perforce I had to flee with him after the outrage. Subsequently we fought with a number who endeavoured to bar our way, and slew seven or eight more. It says much for the tolerance of these beings that on my recapture I was not instantly slain. We made our way to the exterior and separated in the crater of our arrival, to increase our chances of recovering our sphere. But presently I came upon a body of Selenites, led by two who were curiously different, even in form, from any of these we had seen hitherto, with larger heads and smaller bodies, and much more elaborately wrapped about. And after evading them for some time I fell into a crevasse, cut my head rather badly, and displaced my patella, and, finding crawling very painful, decided to surrender--if they would still permit me to do so. This they did, and, perceiving my helpless condition, carried me with them again into the moon. And of Bedford I have heard or seen nothing more, nor, so far as I can gather, any Selenite. Either the night overtook him in the crater, or else, which is more probable, he found the sphere, and, desiring to steal a march upon me, made off with it--only, I fear, to find it uncontrollable, and to meet a more lingering fate in outer space."  And with that Cavor dismisses me and goes on to more interesting topics. I dislike the idea of seeming to use my position as his editor to deflect his story in my own interest, but I am obliged to protest here against the turn he gives these occurrences. He said nothing about that gasping message on the blood-stained paper in which he told, or attempted to tell, a very different story. The dignified self-surrender is an altogether new view of the affair that has come to him, I must insist, since he began to feel secure among the lunar people; and as for the "stealing a march" conception, I am quite willing to let the reader decide between us on what he has before him. I know I am not a model man--I have made no pretence to be. But am I that?  However, that is the sum of my wrongs. From this point I can edit Cavor with an untroubled mind, for he mentions me no more.  It would seem the Selenites who had come upon him carried him to some point in the interior down "a great shaft" by means of what he describes as "a sort of balloon." We gather from the rather confused passage in which he describes this, and from a number of chance allusions and hints in other and subsequent messages, that this "great shaft" is one of an enormous system of artificial shafts that run, each from what is called a lunar "crater," downwards for very nearly a hundred miles towards the central portion of our satellite. These shafts communicate by transverse tunnels, they throw out abysmal caverns and expand into great globular places; the whole of the moon's substance for a hundred miles inward, indeed, is a mere sponge of rock. "Partly," says Cavor, "this sponginess is natural, but very largely it is due to the enormous industry of the Selenites in the past. The enormous circular mounds of the excavated rock and earth it is that form these great circles about the tunnels known to earthly astronomers (misled by a false analogy) as volcanoes."  It was down this shaft they took him, in this "sort of balloon" he speaks of, at first into an inky blackness and then into a region of continually increasing phosphorescence. Cavor's despatches show him to be curiously regardless of detail for a scientific man, but we gather that this light was due to the streams and cascades of water--"no doubt containing some phosphorescent organism"--that flowed ever more abundantly downward towards the Central Sea. And as he descended, he says, "The Selenites also became luminous." And at last far below him he saw, as it were, a lake of heatless fire, the waters of the Central Sea, glowing and eddying in strange perturbation, "like luminous blue milk that is just on the boil."  "This Lunar Sea," says Cavor, in a later passage "is not a stagnant ocean; a solar tide sends it in a perpetual flow around the lunar axis, and strange storms and boilings and rushings of its waters occur, and at times cold winds and thunderings that ascend out of it into the busy ways of the great ant-hill above. It is only when the water is in motion that it gives out light; in its rare seasons of calm it is black. Commonly, when one sees it, its waters rise and fall in an oily swell, and flakes and big rafts of shining, bubbly foam drift with the sluggish, faintly glowing current. The Selenites navigate its cavernous straits and lagoons in little shallow boats of a canoe-like shape; and even before my journey to the galleries about the Grand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon, I was permitted to make a brief excursion on its waters.  "The caverns and passages are naturally very tortuous. A large proportion of these ways are known only to expert pilots among the fishermen, and not infrequently Selenites are lost for ever in their labyrinths. In their remoter recesses, I am told, strange creatures lurk, some of them terrible and dangerous creatures that all the science of the moon has been unable to exterminate. There is particularly the Rapha, an inextricable mass of clutching tentacles that one hacks to pieces only to multiply; and the Tzee, a darting creature that is never seen, so subtly and suddenly does it slay..."  He gives us a gleam of description.  "I was reminded on this excursion of what I have read of the Mammoth Caves; if only I had had a yellow flambeau instead of the pervading blue light, and a solid-looking boatman with an oar instead of a scuttle-faced Selenite working an engine at the back of the canoe, I could have imagined I had suddenly got back to earth. The rocks about us were very various, sometimes black, sometimes pale blue and veined, and once they flashed and glittered as though we had come into a mine of sapphires. And below one saw the ghostly phosphorescent fishes flash and vanish in the hardly less phosphorescent deep. Then, presently, a long ultra-marine vista down the turgid stream of one of the channels of traffic, and a landing stage, and then, perhaps, a glimpse up the enormous crowded shaft of one of the vertical ways.  "In one great place heavy with glistening stalactites a number of boats were fishing. We went alongside one of these and watched the long-armed Selenites winding in a net. They were little, hunchbacked insects, with very strong arms, short, bandy legs, and crinkled face-masks. As they pulled at it that net seemed the heaviest thing I had come upon in the moon; it was loaded with weights--no doubt of gold--and it took a long time to draw, for in those waters the larger and more edible fish lurk deep. The fish in the net came up like a blue moonrise--a blaze of darting, tossing blue.  "Among their catch was a many-tentaculate, evil-eyed black thing, ferociously active, whose appearance they greeted with shrieks and twitters, and which with quick, nervous movements they hacked to pieces by means of little hatchets. All its dissevered limbs continued to lash and writhe in a vicious manner. Afterwards, when fever had hold of me, I dreamt again and again of that bitter, furious creature rising so vigorous and active out of the unknown sea. It was the most active and malignant thing of all the living creatures I have yet seen in this world inside the moon....  "The surface of this sea must be very nearly two hundred miles (if not more) below the level of the moon's exterior; all the cities of the moon lie, I learnt, immediately above this Central Sea, in such cavernous spaces and artificial galleries as I have described, and they communicate with the exterior by enormous vertical shafts which open invariably in what are called by earthly astronomers the 'craters' of the moon. The lid covering one such aperture I had already seen during the wanderings that had preceded my capture.  "Upon the condition of the less central portion of the moon I have not yet arrived at very precise knowledge. There is an enormous system of caverns in which the mooncalves shelter during the night; and there are abattoirs and the like--in one of these it was that I and Bedford fought with the Selenite butchers--and I have since seen balloons laden with meat descending out of the upper dark. I have as yet scarcely learnt as much of these things as a Zulu in London would learn about the British corn supplies in the same time. It is clear, however, that these vertical shafts and the vegetation of the surface must play an essential role in ventilating and keeping fresh the atmosphere of the moon. At one time, and particularly on my first emergence from my prison, there was certainly a cold wind blowing _down_ the shaft, and later there was a kind of sirocco upward that corresponded with my fever. For at the end of about three weeks I fell ill of an indefinable sort of fever, and in spite of sleep and the quinine tabloids that very fortunately I had brought in my pocket, I remained ill and fretting miserably, almost to the time when I was taken into the presence of the Grand Lunar, who is Master of the Moon.  "I will not dilate on the wretchedness of my condition," he remarks, "during those days of ill-health." And he goes on with great amplitude with details I omit here. "My temperature," he concludes, "kept abnormally high for a long time, and I lost all desire for food. I had stagnant waking intervals, and sleep tormented by dreams, and at one phase I was, I remember, so weak as to be earth-sick and almost hysterical. I longed almost intolerably for colour to break the everlasting blue..."  He reverts again presently to the topic of this sponge-caught lunar atmosphere. I am told by astronomers and physicists that all he tells is in absolute accordance with what was already known of the moon's condition. Had earthly astronomers had the courage and imagination to push home a bold induction, says Mr. Wendigee, they might have foretold almost everything that Cavor has to say of the general structure of the moon. They know now pretty certainly that moon and earth are not so much satellite and primary as smaller and greater sisters, made out of one mass, and consequently made of the same material. And since the density of the moon is only three-fifths that of the earth, there can be nothing for it but that she is hollowed out by a great system of caverns. There was no necessity, said Sir Jabez Flap, F.R.S., that most entertaining exponent of the facetious side of the stars, that we should ever have gone to the moon to find out such easy inferences, and points the pun with an allusion to Gruyere, but he certainly might have announced his knowledge of the hollowness of the moon before. And if the moon is hollow, then the apparent absence of air and water is, of course, quite easily explained. The sea lies within at the bottom of the caverns, and the air travels through the great sponge of galleries, in accordance with simple physical laws. The caverns of the moon, on the whole, are very windy places. As the sunlight comes round the moon the air in the outer galleries on that side is heated, its pressure increases, some flows out on the exterior and mingles with the evaporating air of the craters (where the plants remove its carbonic acid), while the greater portion flows round through the galleries to replace the shrinking air of the cooling side that the sunlight has left. There is, therefore, a constant eastward breeze in the air of the outer galleries, and an upflow during the lunar day up the shafts, complicated, of course, very greatly by the varying shape of the galleries, and the ingenious contrivances of the Selenite mind....      Chapter 24     The Natural History of the Selenites  The messages of Cavor from the sixth up to the sixteenth are for the most part so much broken, and they abound so in repetitions, that they scarcely form a consecutive narrative. They will be given in full, of course, in the scientific report, but here it will be far more convenient to continue simply to abstract and quote as in the former chapter. We have subjected every word to a keen critical scrutiny, and my own brief memories and impressions of lunar things have been of inestimable help in interpreting what would otherwise have been impenetrably dark. And, naturally, as living beings, our interest centres far more upon the strange community of lunar insects in which he was living, it would seem, as an honoured guest than upon the mere physical condition of their world.  I have already made it clear, I think, that the Selenites I saw resembled man in maintaining the erect attitude, and in having four limbs, and I have compared the general appearance of their heads and the jointing of their limbs to that of insects. I have mentioned, too, the peculiar consequence of the smaller gravitation of the moon on their fragile slightness. Cavor confirms me upon all these points. He calls them "animals," though of course they fall under no division of the classification of earthly creatures, and he points out "the insect type of anatomy had, fortunately for men, never exceeded a relatively very small size on earth." The largest terrestrial insects, living or extinct, do not, as a matter of fact, measure six inches in length; "but here, against the lesser gravitation of the moon, a creature certainly as much an insect as vertebrate seems to have been able to attain to human and ultra-human dimensions."  He does not mention the ant, but throughout his allusions the ant is continually being brought before my mind, in its sleepless activity, in its intelligence and social organisation, in its structure, and more particularly in the fact that it displays, in addition to the two forms, the male and the female form, that almost all other animals possess, a number of other sexless creatures, workers, soldiers, and the like, differing from one another in structure, character, power, and use, and yet all members of the same species. For these Selenites, also, have a great variety of forms. Of course, they are not only colossally greater in size than ants, but also, in Cavor's opinion at least, in intelligence, morality, and social wisdom are they colossally greater than men. And instead of the four or five different forms of ant that are found, there are almost innumerably different forms of Selenite. I had endeavoured to indicate the very considerable difference observable in such Selenites of the outer crust as I happened to encounter; the differences in size and proportions were certainly as wide as the differences between the most widely separated races of men. But such differences as I saw fade absolutely to nothing in comparison with the huge distinctions of which Cavor tells. It would seem the exterior Selenites I saw were, indeed, mostly engaged in kindred occupations--mooncalf herds, butchers, fleshers, and the like. But within the moon, practically unsuspected by me, there are, it seems, a number of other sorts of Selenite, differing in size, differing in the relative size of part to part, differing in power and appearance, and yet not different species of creatures, but only different forms of one species, and retaining through all their variations a certain common likeness that marks their specific unity. The moon is, indeed, a sort of vast ant-hill, only, instead of there being only four or five sorts of ant, there are many hundred different sorts of Selenite, and almost every gradation between one sort and another.  It would seem the discovery came upon Cavor very speedily. I infer rather than learn from his narrative that he was captured by the mooncalf herds under the direction of these other Selenites who "have larger brain cases (heads?) and very much shorter legs." Finding he would not walk even under the goad, they carried him into darkness, crossed a narrow, plank-like bridge that may have been the identical bridge I had refused, and put him down in something that must have seemed at first to be some sort of lift. This was the balloon--it had certainly been absolutely invisible to us in the darkness--and what had seemed to me a mere plank-walking into the void was really, no doubt, the passage of the gangway. In this he descended towards constantly more luminous caverns of the moon. At first they descended in silence--save for the twitterings of the Selenites--and then into a stir of windy movement. In a little while the profound blackness had made his eyes so sensitive that he began to see more and more of the things about him, and at last the vague took shape.  "Conceive an enormous cylindrical space," says Cavor, in his seventh message, "a quarter of a mile across, perhaps; very dimly lit at first and then brighter, with big platforms twisting down its sides in a spiral that vanishes at last below in a blue profundity; and lit even more brightly--one could not tell how or why. Think of the well of the very largest spiral staircase or lift-shaft that you have ever looked down, and magnify that by a hundred. Imagine it at twilight seen through blue glass. Imagine yourself looking down that; only imagine also that you feel extraordinarily light, and have got rid of any giddy feeling you might have on earth, and you will have the first conditions of my impression. Round this enormous shaft imagine a broad gallery running in a much steeper spiral than would be credible on earth, and forming a steep road protected from the gulf only by a little parapet that vanishes at last in perspective a couple of miles below.  "Looking up, I saw the very fellow of the downward vision; it had, of course, the effect of looking into a very steep cone. A wind was blowing down the shaft, and far above I fancy I heard, growing fainter and fainter, the bellowing of the mooncalves that were being driven down again from their evening pasturage on the exterior. And up and down the spiral galleries were scattered numerous moon people, pallid, faintly luminous beings, regarding our appearance or busied on unknown errands.  "Either I fancied it or a flake of snow came drifting down on the icy breeze. And then, falling like a snowflake, a little figure, a little man-insect, clinging to a parachute, drove down very swiftly towards the central places of the moon.  "The big-headed Selenite sitting beside me, seeing me move my head with the gesture of one who saw, pointed with his trunk-like 'hand' and indicated a sort of jetty coming into sight very far below: a little landing-stage, as it were, hanging into the void. As it swept up towards us our pace diminished very rapidly, and in a few moments, as it seemed, we were abreast of it, and at rest. A mooring-rope was flung and grasped, and I found myself pulled down to a level with a great crowd of Selenites, who jostled to see me.  "It was an incredible crowd. Suddenly and violently there was forced upon my attention the vast amount of difference there is amongst these beings of the moon.  "Indeed, there seemed not two alike in all that jostling multitude. They differed in shape, they differed in size, they rang all the horrible changes on the theme of Selenite form! Some bulged and overhung, some ran about among the feet of their fellows. All of them had a grotesque and disquieting suggestion of an insect that has somehow contrived to mock humanity; but all seemed to present an incredible exaggeration of some particular feature: one had a vast right fore-limb, an enormous antennal arm, as it were; one seemed all leg, poised, as it were, on stilts; another protruded the edge of his face mask into a nose-like organ that made him startlingly human until one saw his expressionless gaping mouth. The strange and (except for the want of mandibles and palps) most insect-like head of the mooncalf-minders underwent, indeed, the most incredible transformations: here it was broad and low, here high and narrow; here its leathery brow was drawn out into horns and strange features; here it was whiskered and divided, and there with a grotesquely human profile. One distortion was particularly conspicuous. There were several brain cases distended like bladders to a huge size, with the face mask reduced to quite small proportions. There were several amazing forms, with heads reduced to microscopic proportions and blobby bodies; and fantastic, flimsy things that existed, it would seem, only as a basis for vast, trumpet-like protrusions of the lower part of the mask. And oddest of all, as it seemed to me for the moment, two or three of these weird inhabitants of a subterranean world, a world sheltered by innumerable miles of rock from sun or rain, _carried umbrellas_ in their tentaculate hands--real terrestrial looking umbrellas! And then I thought of the parachutist I had watched descend.  "These moon people behaved exactly as a human crowd might have done in similar circumstances: they jostled and thrust one another, they shoved one another aside, they even clambered upon one another to get a glimpse of me. Every moment they increased in numbers, and pressed more urgently upon the discs of my ushers"--Cavor does not explain what he means by this--"every moment fresh shapes emerged from the shadows and forced themselves upon my astounded attention. And presently I was signed and helped into a sort of litter, and lifted up on the shoulders of strong-armed bearers, and so borne through the twilight over this seething multitude towards the apartments that were provided for me in the moon. All about me were eyes, faces, masks, a leathery noise like the rustling of beetle wings, and a great bleating and cricket-like twittering of Selenite voices."  We gather he was taken to a "hexagonal apartment," and there for a space he was confined. Afterwards he was given a much more considerable liberty; indeed, almost as much freedom as one has in a civilised town on earth. And it would appear that the mysterious being who is the ruler and master of the moon appointed two Selenites "with large heads" to guard and study him, and to establish whatever mental communications were possible with him. And, amazing and incredible as it may seem, these two creatures, these fantastic men insects, these beings of other world, were presently communicating with Cavor by means of terrestrial speech.  Cavor speaks of them as Phi-oo and Tsi-puff. Phi-oo, he says, was about 5 feet high; he had small slender legs about 18 inches long, and slight feet of the common lunar pattern. On these balanced a little body, throbbing with the pulsations of his heart. He had long, soft, many-jointed arms ending in a tentacled grip, and his neck was many-jointed in the usual way, but exceptionally short and thick. His head, says Cavor--apparently alluding to some previous description that has gone astray in space--"is of the common lunar type, but strangely modified. The mouth has the usual expressionless gape, but it is unusually small and pointing downward, and the mask is reduced to the size of a large flat nose-flap. On either side are the little eyes.  "The rest of the head is distended into a huge globe and the chitinous leathery cuticle of the mooncalf herds thins out to a mere membrane, through which the pulsating brain movements are distinctly visible. He is a creature, indeed, with a tremendously hypertrophied brain, and with the rest of his organism both relatively and absolutely dwarfed."  In another passage Cavor compares the back view of him to Atlas supporting the world. Tsi-puff it seems was a very similar insect, but his "face" was drawn out to a considerable length, and the brain hypertrophy being in different regions, his head was not round but pear-shaped, with the stalk downward. There were also litter-carriers, lopsided beings, with enormous shoulders, very spidery ushers, and a squat foot attendant in Cavor's retinue.  The manner in which Phi-oo and Tsi-puff attacked the problem of speech was fairly obvious. They came into this "hexagonal cell" in which Cavor was confined, and began imitating every sound he made, beginning with a cough. He seems to have grasped their intention with great quickness, and to have begun repeating words to them and pointing to indicate the application. The procedure was probably always the same. Phi-oo would attend to Cavor for a space, then point also and say the word he had heard.  The first word he mastered was "man," and the second "Mooney"--which Cavor on the spur of the moment seems to have used instead of "Selenite" for the moon race. As soon as Phi-oo was assured of the meaning of a word he repeated it to Tsi-puff, who remembered it infallibly. They mastered over one hundred English nouns at their first session.  Subsequently it seems they brought an artist with them to assist the work of explanation with sketches and diagrams--Cavor's drawings being rather crude. "He was," says Cavor, "a being with an active arm and an arresting eye," and he seemed to draw with incredible swiftness.  The eleventh message is undoubtedly only a fragment of a longer communication. After some broken sentences, the record of which is unintelligible, it goes on:--  "But it will interest only linguists, and delay me too long, to give the details of the series of intent parleys of which these were the beginning, and, indeed, I very much doubt if I could give in anything like the proper order all the twistings and turnings that we made in our pursuit of mutual comprehension. Verbs were soon plain sailing--at least, such active verbs as I could express by drawings; some adjectives were easy, but when it came to abstract nouns, to prepositions, and the sort of hackneyed figures of speech, by means of which so much is expressed on earth, it was like diving in cork-jackets. Indeed, these difficulties were insurmountable until to the sixth lesson came a fourth assistant, a being with a huge football-shaped head, whose forte was clearly the pursuit of intricate analogy. He entered in a preoccupied manner, stumbling against a stool, and the difficulties that arose had to be presented to him with a certain amount of clamour and hitting and pricking before they reached his apprehension. But once he was involved his penetration was amazing. Whenever there came a need of thinking beyond Phi-oo's by no means limited scope, this prolate-headed person was in request, but he invariably told the conclusion to Tsi-puff, in order that it might be remembered; Tsi-puff was ever the arsenal for facts. And so we advanced again.  "It seemed long and yet brief--a matter of days--before I was positively talking with these insects of the moon. Of course, at first it was an intercourse infinitely tedious and exasperating, but imperceptibly it has grown to comprehension. And my patience has grown to meet its limitations, Phi-oo it is who does all the talking. He does it with a vast amount of meditative provisional 'M'm--M'm' and has caught up one or two phrases, 'If I may say,' 'If you understand,' and beads all his speech with them.  "Thus he would discourse. Imagine him explaining his artist.  "'M'm--M'm--he--if I may say--draw. Eat little--drink little--draw. Love draw. No other thing. Hate all who not draw like him. Angry. Hate all who draw like him better. Hate most people. Hate all who not think all world for to draw. Angry. M'm. All things mean nothing to him--only draw. He like you ... if you understand.... New thing to draw. Ugly--striking. Eh?  "'He'--turning to Tsi-puff--'love remember words. Remember wonderful more than any. Think no, draw no--remember. Say'--here he referred to his gifted assistant for a word--'histories--all things. He hear once--say ever.'  "It is more wonderful to me than I dreamt that anything ever could be again, to hear, in this perpetual obscurity, these extraordinary creatures--for even familiarity fails to weaken the inhuman effect of their appearance--continually piping a nearer approach to coherent earthly speech--asking questions, giving answers. I feel that I am casting back to the fable-hearing period of childhood again, when the ant and the grasshopper talked together and the bee judged between them..."  And while these linguistic exercises were going on Cavor seems to have experienced a considerable relaxation of his confinement. "The first dread and distrust our unfortunate conflict aroused is being," he said, "continually effaced by the deliberate rationality of all I do.... I am now able to come and go as I please, or I am restricted only for my own good. So it is I have been able to get at this apparatus, and, assisted by a happy find among the material that is littered in this enormous store-cave, I have contrived to despatch these messages. So far not the slightest attempt has been made to interfere with me in this, though I have made it quite clear to Phi-oo that I am signalling to the earth.  "'You talk to other?' he asked, watching me.  "'Others,' said I.  "'Others,' he said. 'Oh yes, Men?'  "And I went on transmitting."  Cavor was continually making corrections in his previous accounts of the Selenites as fresh facts flowed upon him to modify his conclusions, and accordingly one gives the quotations that follow with a certain amount of reservation. They are quoted from the ninth, thirteenth, and sixteenth messages, and, altogether vague and fragmentary as they are, they probably give as complete a picture of the social life of this strange community as mankind can now hope to have for many generations.  "In the moon," says Cavor, "every citizen knows his place. He is born to that place, and the elaborate discipline of training and education and surgery he undergoes fits him at last so completely to it that he has neither ideas nor organs for any purpose beyond it. 'Why should he?' Phi-oo would ask. If, for example, a Selenite is destined to be a mathematician, his teachers and trainers set out at once to that end. They check any incipient disposition to other pursuits, they encourage his mathematical bias with a perfect psychological skill. His brain grows, or at least the mathematical faculties of his brain grow, and the rest of him only so much as is necessary to sustain this essential part of him. At last, save for rest and food, his one delight lies in the exercise and display of his faculty, his one interest in its application, his sole society with other specialists in his own line. His brain grows continually larger, at least so far as the portions engaging in mathematics are concerned; they bulge ever larger and seem to suck all life and vigour from the rest of his frame. His limbs shrivel, his heart and digestive organs diminish, his insect face is hidden under its bulging contours. His voice becomes a mere stridulation for the stating of formula; he seems deaf to all but properly enunciated problems. The faculty of laughter, save for the sudden discovery of some paradox, is lost to him; his deepest emotion is the evolution of a novel computation. And so he attains his end.  "Or, again, a Selenite appointed to be a minder of mooncalves is from his earliest years induced to think and live mooncalf, to find his pleasure in mooncalf lore, his exercise in their tending and pursuit. He is trained to become wiry and active, his eye is indurated to the tight wrappings, the angular contours that constitute a 'smart mooncalfishness.' He takes at last no interest in the deeper part of the moon; he regards all Selenites not equally versed in mooncalves with indifference, derision, or hostility. His thoughts are of mooncalf pastures, and his dialect an accomplished mooncalf technique. So also he loves his work, and discharges in perfect happiness the duty that justifies his being. And so it is with all sorts and conditions of Selenites--each is a perfect unit in a world machine....  "These beings with big heads, on whom the intellectual labours fall, form a sort of aristocracy in this strange society, and at the head of them, quintessential of the moon, is that marvellous gigantic ganglion the Grand Lunar, into whose presence I am finally to come. The unlimited development of the minds of the intellectual class is rendered possible by the absence of any bony skull in the lunar anatomy, that strange box of bone that clamps about the developing brain of man, imperiously insisting 'thus far and no farther' to all his possibilities. They fall into three main classes differing greatly in influence and respect. There are administrators, of whom Phi-oo is one, Selenites of considerable initiative and versatility, responsible each for a certain cubic content of the moon's bulk; the experts like the football-headed thinker, who are trained to perform certain special operations; and the erudite, who are the repositories of all knowledge. To the latter class belongs Tsi-puff, the first lunar professor of terrestrial languages. With regard to these latter, it is a curious little thing to note that the unlimited growth of the lunar brain has rendered unnecessary the invention of all those mechanical aids to brain work which have distinguished the career of man. There are no books, no records of any sort, no libraries or inscriptions. All knowledge is stored in distended brains much as the honey-ants of Texas store honey in their distended abdomens. The lunar Somerset House and the lunar British Museum Library are collections of living brains...  "The less specialised administrators, I note, do for the most part take a very lively interest in me whenever they encounter me. They will come out of the way and stare at me and ask questions to which Phi-oo will reply. I see them going hither and thither with a retinue of bearers, attendants, shouters, parachute-carriers, and so forth--queer groups to see. The experts for the most part ignore me completely, even as they ignore each other, or notice me only to begin a clamorous exhibition of their distinctive skill. The erudite for the most part are rapt in an impervious and apoplectic complacency, from which only a denial of their erudition can rouse them. Usually they are led about by little watchers and attendants, and often there are small and active-looking creatures, small females usually, that I am inclined to think are a sort of wife to them; but some of the profounder scholars are altogether too great for locomotion, and are carried from place to place in a sort of sedan tub, wabbling jellies of knowledge that enlist my respectful astonishment. I have just passed one in coming to this place where I am permitted to amuse myself with these electrical toys, a vast, shaven, shaky head, bald and thin-skinned, carried on his grotesque stretcher. In front and behind came his bearers, and curious, almost trumpet-faced, news disseminators shrieked his fame.  "I have already mentioned the retinues that accompany most of the intellectuals: ushers, bearers, valets, extraneous tentacles and muscles, as it were, to replace the abortive physical powers of these hypertrophied minds. Porters almost invariably accompany them. There are also extremely swift messengers with spider-like legs and 'hands' for grasping parachutes, and attendants with vocal organs that could well nigh wake the dead. Apart from their controlling intelligence these subordinates are as inert and helpless as umbrellas in a stand. They exist only in relation to the orders they have to obey, the duties they have to perform.  "The bulk of these insects, however, who go to and fro upon the spiral ways, who fill the ascending balloons and drop past me clinging to flimsy parachutes are, I gather, of the operative class. 'Machine hands,' indeed, some of these are in actual nature--it is not figure of speech, the single tentacle of the mooncalf herd is profoundly modified for clawing, lifting, guiding, the rest of them no more than necessary subordinate appendages to these important mechanisms, have enormously developed auditory organs; some whose work lies in delicate chemical operations project a vast olfactory organ; others again have flat feet for treadles with anchylosed joints; and others--who I have been told are glassblowers--seem mere lung-bellows. But every one of these common Selenites I have seen at work is exquisitely adapted to the social need it meets. Fine work is done by fined-down workers, amazingly dwarfed and neat. Some I could hold on the palm of my hand. There is even a sort of turnspit Selenite, very common, whose duty and only delight it is to apply the motive power for various small appliances. And to rule over these things and order any erring tendency there might be in some aberrant natures are the most muscular beings I have seen in the moon, a sort of lunar police, who must have been trained from their earliest years to give a perfect respect and obedience to the swollen heads.  "The making of these various sorts of operative must be a very curious and interesting process. I am very much in the dark about it, but quite recently I came upon a number of young Selenites confined in jars from which only the fore-limbs protruded, who were being compressed to become machine-minders of a special sort. The extended 'hand' in this highly developed system of technical education is stimulated by irritants and nourished by injection, while the rest of the body is starved. Phi-oo, unless I misunderstood him, explained that in the earlier stages these queer little creatures are apt to display signs of suffering in their various cramped situations, but they easily become indurated to their lot; and he took me on to where a number of flexible-minded messengers were being drawn out and broken in. It is quite unreasonable, I know, but such glimpses of the educational methods of these beings affect me disagreeably. I hope, however, that may pass off, and I may be able to see more of this aspect of their wonderful social order. That wretched-looking hand-tentacle sticking out of its jar seemed to have a sort of limp appeal for lost possibilities; it haunts me still, although, of course it is really in the end a far more humane proceeding than our earthly method of leaving children to grow into human beings, and then making machines of them.  "Quite recently, too--I think it was on the eleventh or twelfth visit I made to this apparatus--I had a curious light upon the lives of these operatives. I was being guided through a short cut hither, instead of going down the spiral, and by the quays to the Central Sea. From the devious windings of a long, dark gallery, we emerged into a vast, low cavern, pervaded by an earthy smell, and as things go in this darkness, rather brightly lit. The light came from a tumultuous growth of livid fungoid shapes--some indeed singularly like our terrestrial mushrooms, but standing as high or higher than a man.  "'Mooneys eat these?' said I to Phi-oo.  "'Yes, food.'  "'Goodness me!' I cried; 'what's that?'  "My eye had just caught the figure of an exceptionally big and ungainly Selenite lying motionless among the stems, face downward. We stopped.  "'Dead?' I asked. (For as yet I have seen no dead the moon, and I have grown curious.)  "'No!' exclaimed Phi-oo. 'Him--worker--no work to do. Get little drink then--make sleep--till we him want. What good him wake, eh? No want him walking about.'  "'There's another!' cried I.  "And indeed all that huge extent of mushroom ground was, I found, peppered with these prostrate figures sleeping under an opiate until the moon had need of them. There were scores of them of all sorts, and we were able to turn over some of them, and examine them more precisely than I had been able to previously. They breathed noisily at my doing so, but did not wake. One, I remember very distinctly: he left a strong impression, I think, because some trick the light and of his attitude was strongly suggestive a drawn-up human figure. His fore-limbs were long, delicate tentacles--he was some kind of refined manipulator--and the pose of his slumber suggested a submissive suffering. No doubt it was a mistake for me to interpret his expression in that way, but I did. And as Phi-oo rolled him over into the darkness among the livid fleshiness again I felt a distinctly unpleasant sensation, although as he rolled the insect in him was confessed.  "It simply illustrates the unthinking way in which one acquires habits of feeling. To drug the worker one does not want and toss him aside is surely far better than to expel him from his factory to wander starving in the streets. In every complicated social community there is necessarily a certain intermittency of employment for all specialised labour, and in this way the trouble of an 'unemployed' problem is altogether anticipated. And yet, so unreasonable are even scientifically trained minds, I still do not like the memory of those prostrate forms amidst those quiet, luminous arcades of fleshy growth, and I avoid that short cut in spite of the inconveniences of the longer, more noisy, and more crowded alternative.  "My alternative route takes me round by a huge, shadowy cavern, very crowded and clamorous, and here it is I see peering out of the hexagonal openings of a sort of honeycomb wall, or parading a large open space behind, or selecting the toys and amulets made to please them by the dainty-tentacled jewellers who work in kennels below, the mothers of the moon world--the queen bees, as it were, of the hive. They are noble-looking beings, fantastically and sometimes quite beautifully adorned, with a proud carriage, and, save for their mouths, almost microscopic heads.  "Of the condition of the moon sexes, marrying and giving in marriage, and of birth and so forth among the Selenites, I have as yet been able to learn very little. With the steady progress of Phi-oo in English, however, my ignorance will no doubt as steadily disappear. I am of opinion that, as with the ants and bees, there is a large majority of the members in this community of the neuter sex. Of course on earth in our cities there are now many who never live that life of parentage which is the natural life of man. Here, as with the ants, this thing has become a normal condition of the race, and the whole of such eplacement as is necessary falls upon this special and by no means numerous class of matrons, the mothers of the moon-world, large and stately beings beautifully fitted to bear the larval Selenite. Unless I misunderstand an explanation of Phi-oo's, they are absolutely incapable of cherishing the young they bring into the moon; periods of foolish indulgence alternate with moods of aggressive violence, and as soon as possible the little creatures, who are quite soft and flabby and pale coloured, are transferred to the charge of celibate females, women 'workers' as it were, who in some cases possess brains of almost masculine dimensions."  Just at this point, unhappily, this message broke off. Fragmentary and tantalising as the matter constituting this chapter is, it does nevertheless give a vague, broad impression of an altogether strange and wonderful world--a world with which our own may have to reckon we know not how speedily. This intermittent trickle of messages, this whispering of a record needle in the stillness of the mountain slopes, is the first warning of such a change in human conditions as mankind has scarcely imagined heretofore. In that satellite of ours there are new elements, new appliances, traditions, an overwhelming avalanche of new ideas, a strange race with whom we must inevitably struggle for mastery--gold as common as iron or wood...      Chapter 25     The Grand Lunar  The penultimate message describes, with occasionally elaborate detail, the encounter between Cavor and the Grand Lunar, who is the ruler or master of the moon. Cavor seems to have sent most of it without interference, but to have been interrupted in the concluding portion. The second came after an interval of a week.  The first message begins: "At last I am able to resume this--" it then becomes illegible for a space, and after a time resumed in mid-sentence.  The missing words of the following sentence are probably "the crowd." There follows quite clearly: "grew ever denser as we drew near the palace of the Grand Lunar--if I may call a series of excavations a palace. Everywhere faces stared at me--blank, chitinous gapes and masks, eyes peering over tremendous olfactory developments, eyes beneath monstrous forehead plates; and undergrowth of smaller creatures dodged and yelped, and helmet faces poised on sinuous, long-jointed necks appeared craning over shoulders and beneath armpits. Keeping a welcome space about me marched a cordon of stolid, scuttle-headed guards, who had joined us on our leaving the boat in which we had come along the channels of the Central Sea. The quick-eyed artist with the little brain joined us also, and a thick bunch of lean porter-insects swayed and struggled under the multitude of conveniences that were considered essential to my state. I was carried in a litter during the final stage of our journey. This litter was made of some very ductile metal that looked dark to me, meshed and woven, and with bars of paler metal, and about me as I advanced there grouped itself a long and complicated procession.  "In front, after the manner of heralds, marched four trumpet-faced creatures making a devastating bray; and then came squat, resolute-moving ushers before and behind, and on either hand a galaxy of learned heads, a sort of animated encyclopedia, who were, Phi-oo explained, to stand about the Grand Lunar for purposes of reference. (Not a thing in lunar science, not a point of view or method of thinking, that these wonderful beings did not carry in their heads!) Followed guards and porters, and then Phi-oo's shivering brain borne also on a litter. Then came Tsi-puff in a slightly less important litter; then myself on a litter of greater elegance than any other, and surrounded by my food and drink attendants. More trumpeters came next, splitting the ear with vehement outcries, and then several big brains, special correspondents one might well call them, or historiographers, charged with the task of observing and remembering every detail of this epoch-making interview. A company of attendants, bearing and dragging banners and masses of scented fungus and curious symbols, vanished in the darkness behind. The way was lined by ushers and officers in caparisons that gleamed like steel, and beyond their line, so far as my eyes could pierce the gloom, the heads of that enormous crowd extended.  "I will own that I am still by no means indurated to the peculiar effect of the Selenite appearance, and to find myself, as it were, adrift on this broad sea of excited entomology was by no means agreeable. Just for a space I had something very like what I should imagine people mean when they speak of the 'horrors.' It had come to me before in these lunar caverns, when on occasion I have found myself weaponless and with an undefended back, amidst a crowd of these Selenites, but never quite so vividly. It is, of course, as absolutely irrational a feeling as one could well have, and I hope gradually to subdue it. But just for a moment, as I swept forward into the welter of the vast crowd, it was only by gripping my litter tightly and summoning all my will-power that I succeeded in avoiding an outcry or some such manifestation. It lasted perhaps three minutes; then I had myself in hand again.  "We ascended the spiral of a vertical way for some time, and then passed through a series of huge halls dome-roofed and elaborately decorated. The approach to the Grand Lunar was certainly contrived to give one a vivid impression of his greatness. Each cavern one entered seemed greater and more boldly arched than its predecessor. This effect of progressive size was enhanced by a thin haze of faintly phosphorescent blue incense that thickened as one advanced, and robbed even the nearer figures of clearness. I seemed to advance continually to something larger, dimmer, and less material.  "I must confess that all this multitude made me feel extremely shabby and unworthy. I was unshaven and unkempt; I had brought no razor; I had a coarse beard over my mouth. On earth I have always been inclined to despise any attention to my person beyond a proper care for cleanliness; but under the exceptional circumstances in which I found myself, representing, as I did, my planet and my kind, and depending very largely upon the attractiveness of my appearance for a proper reception, I could have given much for something a little more artistic and dignified than the husks I wore. I had been so serene in the belief that the moon was uninhabited as to overlook such precautions altogether. As it was I was dressed in a flannel jacket, knickerbockers, and golfing stockings, stained with every sort of dirt the moon offered, slippers (of which the left heel was wanting), and a blanket, through a hole in which I thrust my head. (These clothes, indeed, I still wear.) Sharp bristles are anything but an improvement to my cast of features, and there was an unmended tear at the knee of my knickerbockers that showed conspicuously as I squatted in my litter; my right stocking, too, persisted in getting about my ankle. I am fully alive to the injustice my appearance did humanity, and if by any expedient I could have improvised something a little out of the way and imposing I would have done so. But I could hit upon nothing. I did what I could with my blanket--folding it somewhat after the fashion of a toga, and for the rest I sat as upright as the swaying of my litter permitted.  "Imagine the largest hall you have ever been in, imperfectly lit with blue light and obscured by a gray-blue fog, surging with metallic or livid-gray creatures of such a mad diversity as I have hinted. Imagine this hall to end in an open archway beyond which is a still larger hall, and beyond this yet another and still larger one, and so on. At the end of the vista, dimly seen, a flight of steps, like the steps of Ara Coeli at Rome, ascend out of sight. Higher and higher these steps appear to go as one draws nearer their base. But at last I came under a huge archway and beheld the summit of these steps, and upon it the Grand Lunar exalted on his throne.  "He was seated in what was relatively a blaze of incandescent blue. This, and the darkness about him gave him an effect of floating in a blue-black void. He seemed a small, self-luminous cloud at first, brooding on his sombre throne; his brain case must have measured many yards in diameter. For some reason that I cannot fathom a number of blue search-lights radiated from behind the throne on which he sat, and immediately encircling him was a halo. About him, and little and indistinct in this glow, a number of body-servants sustained and supported him, and overshadowed and standing in a huge semicircle beneath him were his intellectual subordinates, his remembrancers and computators and searchers and servants, and all the distinguished insects of the court of the moon. Still lower stood ushers and messengers, and then all down the countless steps of the throne were guards, and at the base, enormous, various, indistinct, vanishing at last into an absolute black, a vast swaying multitude of the minor dignitaries of the moon. Their feet made a perpetual scraping whisper on the rocky floor, as their limbs moved with a rustling murmur.  "As I entered the penultimate hall the music rose and expanded into an imperial magnificence of sound, and the shrieks of the news-bearers died away....  "I entered the last and greatest hall....  "My procession opened out like a fan. My ushers and guards went right and left, and the three litters bearing myself and Phi-oo and Tsi-puff marched across a shiny darkness of floor to the foot of the giant stairs. Then began a vast throbbing hum, that mingled with the music. The two Selenites dismounted, but I was bidden remain seated--I imagine as a special honour. The music ceased, but not that humming, and by a simultaneous movement of ten thousand respectful heads my attention was directed to the enhaloed supreme intelligence that hovered above me.  "At first as I peered into the radiating glow this quintessential brain looked very much like an opaque, featureless bladder with dim, undulating ghosts of convolutions writhing visibly within. Then beneath its enormity and just above the edge of the throne one saw with a start minute elfin eyes peering out of the glow. No face, but eyes, as if they peered through holes. At first I could see no more than these two staring little eyes, and then below I distinguished the little dwarfed body and its insect-jointed limbs shrivelled and white. The eyes stared down at me with a strange intensity, and the lower part of the swollen globe was wrinkled. Ineffectual-looking little hand-tentacles steadied this shape on the throne....  "It was great. It was pitiful. One forgot the hall and the crowd.  "I ascended the staircase by jerks. It seemed to me that this darkly glowing brain case above us spread over me, and took more and more of the whole effect into itself as I drew nearer. The tiers of attendants and helpers grouped about their master seemed to dwindle and fade into the night. I saw that shadowy attendants were busy spraying that great brain with a cooling spray, and patting and sustaining it. For my own part, I sat gripping my swaying litter and staring at the Grand Lunar, unable to turn my gaze aside. And at last, as I reached a little landing that was separated only by ten steps or so from the supreme seat, the woven splendour of the music reached a climax and ceased, and I was left naked, as it were, in that vastness, beneath the still scrutiny of the Grand Lunar's eyes.  "He was scrutinising the first man he had ever seen....  "My eyes dropped at last from his greatness to the ant figures in the blue mist about him, and then down the steps to the massed Selenites, still and expectant in their thousands, packed on the floor below. Once again an unreasonable horror reached out towards me.... And passed.  "After the pause came the salutation. I was assisted from my litter, and stood awkwardly while a number of curious and no doubt deeply symbolical gestures were vicariously performed for me by two slender officials. The encyclopaedic galaxy of the learned that had accompanied me to the entrance of the last hall appeared two steps above me and left and right of me, in readiness for the Grand Lunar's need, and Phi-oo's pale brain placed itself about half-way up to the throne in such a position as to communicate easily between us without turning his back on either the Grand Lunar or myself. Tsi-puff took up position behind him. Dexterous ushers sidled sideways towards me, keeping a full face to the Presence. I seated myself Turkish fashion, and Phi-oo and Tsi-puff also knelt down above me. There came a pause. The eyes of the nearer court went from me to the Grand Lunar and came back to me, and a hissing and piping of expectation passed across the hidden multitudes below and ceased.  "That humming ceased.  "For the first and last time in my experience the moon was silent.  "I became aware of a faint wheezy noise. The Grand Lunar was addressing me. It was like the rubbing of a finger upon a pane of glass.  "I watched him attentively for a time, and then glanced at the alert Phi-oo. I felt amidst these slender beings ridiculously thick and fleshy and solid; my head all jaw and black hair. My eyes went back to the Grand Lunar. He had ceased; his attendants were busy, and his shining superfices was glistening and running with cooling spray.  "Phi-oo meditated through an interval. He consulted Tsi-puff. Then he began piping his recognisable English--at first a little nervously, so that he was not very clear.  "'M'm--the Grand Lunar--wished to say--wishes to say--he gathers you are--m'm--men--that you are a man from the planet earth. He wishes to say that he welcomes you--welcomes you--and wishes to learn--learn, if I may use the word--the state of your world, and the reason why you came to this.'  "He paused. I was about to reply when he resumed. He proceeded to remarks of which the drift was not very clear, though I am inclined to think they were intended to be complimentary. He told me that the earth was to the moon what the sun is to the earth, and that the Selenites desired very greatly to learn about the earth and men. He then told me no doubt in compliment also, the relative magnitude and diameter of earth and moon, and the perpetual wonder and speculation with which the Selenites had regarded our planet. I meditated with downcast eyes, and decided to reply that men too had wondered what might lie in the moon, and had judged it dead, little recking of such magnificence as I had seen that day. The Grand Lunar, in token of recognition, caused his long blue rays to rotate in a very confusing manner, and all about the great hall ran the pipings and whisperings and rustlings of the report of what I had said. He then proceeded to put to Phi-oo a number of inquiries which were easier to answer.  "He understood, he explained, that we lived on the surface of the earth, that our air and sea were outside the globe; the latter part, indeed, he already knew from his astronomical specialists. He was very anxious to have more detailed information of what he called this extraordinary state of affairs, for from the solidity of the earth there had always been a disposition regard it as uninhabitable. He endeavoured first to ascertain the extremes of temperature to which we earth beings were exposed, and he was deeply interested by my descriptive treatment of clouds and rain. His imagination was assisted by the fact that the lunar atmosphere in the outer galleries of the night side is not infrequently very foggy. He seemed inclined to marvel that we did not find the sunlight too intense for our eyes, and was interested in my attempt to explain that the sky was tempered to a bluish colour through the refraction of the air, though I doubt if he clearly understood that. I explained how the iris of the human eyes can contract the pupil and save the delicate internal structure from the excess of sunlight, and was allowed to approach within a few feet of the Presence in order that this structure might be seen. This led to a comparison of the lunar and terrestrial eyes. The former is not only excessively sensitive to such light as men can see, but it can also _see_ heat, and every difference in temperature within the moon renders objects visible to it.  "The iris was quite a new organ to the Grand Lunar. For a time he amused himself by flashing his rays into my face and watching my pupils contract. As a consequence, I was dazzled and blinded for some little time....  "But in spite of that discomfort I found something reassuring by insensible degrees in the rationality of this business of question and answer. I could shut my eyes, think of my answer, and almost forget that the the Grand Lunar has no face....  "When I had descended again to my proper place the Grand Lunar asked how we sheltered ourselves from heat and storms, and I expounded to him the arts of building and furnishing. Here we wandered into misunderstandings and cross-purposes, due largely, I must admit, to the looseness of my expressions. For a long time I had great difficulty in making him understand the nature of a house. To him and his attendant Selenites it seemed, no doubt, the most whimsical thing in the world that men should build houses when they might descend into excavations, and an additional complication was introduced by the attempt I made to explain that men had originally begun their homes in caves, and that they were now taking their railways and many establishments beneath the surface. Here I think a desire for intellectual completeness betrayed me. There was also a considerable tangle due to an equally unwise attempt on my part to explain about mines. Dismissing this topic at last in an incomplete state, the Grand Lunar inquired what we did with the interior of our globe.  "A tide of twittering and piping swept into the remotest corners of that great assembly then it was last made clear that we men know absolutely nothing of the contents of the world upon which the immemorial generations of our ancestors had been evolved. Three times had I to repeat that of all the 4000 miles of distance between the earth and its centre men knew only to the depth of a mile, and that very vaguely. I understood the Grand Lunar to ask why had I come to the moon seeing we had scarcely touched our own planet yet, but he did not trouble me at that time to proceed to an explanation, being too anxious to pursue the details of this mad inversion of all his ideas.  "He reverted to the question of weather, and I tried to describe the perpetually changing sky, and snow, and frost and hurricanes. 'But when the night comes,' he asked, 'is it not cold?'  "I told him it was colder than by day.  "'And does not your atmosphere freeze?'  "I told him not; that it was never cold enough for that, because our nights were so short.  "'Not even liquefy?'  "I was about to say 'No,' but then it occurred to me that one part at least of our atmosphere, the water vapour of it, does sometimes liquefy and form dew, and sometimes freeze and form frost--a process perfectly analogous to the freezing of all the external atmosphere of the moon during its longer night. I made myself clear on this point, and from that the Grand Lunar went on to speak with me of sleep. For the need of sleep that comes so regularly every twenty-four hours to all things is part also of our earthly inheritance. On the moon they rest only at rare intervals, and after exceptional exertions. Then I tried to describe to him the soft splendours of a summer night, and from that I passed to a description of those animals that prowl by night and sleep by day. I told him of lions and tigers, and here it seemed as though we had come to a deadlock. For, save in their waters, there are no creatures in the moon not absolutely domestic and subject to his will, and so it has been for immemorial years. They have monstrous water creatures, but no evil beasts, and the idea of anything strong and large existing 'outside' in the night is very difficult for them...."  [The record is here too broken to transcribe for the space of perhaps twenty words or more.]  "He talked with his attendants, as I suppose, upon the strange superficiality and unreasonableness of (man) who lives on the mere surface of a world, a creature of waves and winds, and all the chances of space, who cannot even unite to overcome the beasts that prey upon his kind, and yet who dares to invade another planet. During this aside I sat thinking, and then at his desire I told him of the different sorts of men. He searched me with questions. 'And for all sorts of work you have the same sort of men. But who thinks? Who governs?'  "I gave him an outline of the democratic method.  "When I had done he ordered cooling sprays upon his brow, and then requested me to repeat my explanation conceiving something had miscarried.  "'Do they not do different things, then?' said Phi-oo.  "Some, I admitted, were thinkers and some officials; some hunted, some were mechanics, some artists, some toilers. 'But _all_ rule,' I said.  "'And have they not different shapes to fit them to their different duties?'  "'None that you can see,' I said, 'except perhaps, for clothes. Their minds perhaps differ a little,' I reflected.  "'Their minds must differ a great deal,' said the Grand Lunar, 'or they would all want to do the same things.'  "In order to bring myself into a closer harmony with his preconceptions, I said that his surmise was right. 'It was all hidden in the brain,' I said; 'but the difference was there. Perhaps if one could see the minds and souls of men they would be as varied and unequal as the Selenites. There were great men and small men, men who could reach out far and wide, men who could go swiftly; noisy, trumpet-minded men, and men who could remember without thinking....'"  [The record is indistinct for three words.]  "He interrupted me to recall me to my previous statements. 'But you said all men rule?' he pressed.  "'To a certain extent,' I said, and made, I fear, a denser fog with my explanation.  "He reached out to a salient fact. 'Do you mean,' asked, 'that there is no Grand Earthly?'  "I thought of several people, but assured him finally there was none. I explained that such autocrats and emperors as we had tried upon earth had usually ended in drink, or vice, or violence, and that the large and influential section of the people of the earth to which I belonged, the Anglo-Saxons, did not mean to try that sort of thing again. At which the Grand Lunar was even more amazed.  "'But how do you keep even such wisdom as you have?' he asked; and I explained to him the way we helped our limited"  [A word omitted here, probably "brains."]  "with libraries of books. I explained to him how our science was growing by the united labours of innumerable little men, and on that he made no comment save that it was evident we had mastered much in spite of our social savagery, or we could not have come to the moon. Yet the contrast was very marked. With knowledge the Selenites grew and changed; mankind stored their knowledge about them and remained brutes--equipped. He said this..."  [Here there is a short piece of the record indistinct.]  "He then caused me to describe how we went about this earth of ours, and I described to him our railways and ships. For a time he could not understand that we had had the use of steam only one hundred years, but when he did he was clearly amazed. (I may mention as a singular thing, that the Selenites use years to count by, just as we do on earth, though I can make nothing of their numeral system. That, however, does not matter, because Phi-oo understands ours.) From that I went on to tell him that mankind had dwelt in cities only for nine or ten thousand years, and that we were still not united in one brotherhood, but under many different forms of government. This astonished the Grand Lunar very much, when it was made clear to him. At first he thought we referred merely to administrative areas.  "'Our States and Empires are still the rawest sketches of what order will some day be,' I said, and so I came to tell him...."  [At this point a length of record that probably represents thirty or forty words is totally illegible.]  "The Grand Lunar was greatly impressed by the folly of men in clinging to the inconvenience of diverse tongues. 'They want to communicate, and yet not to communicate,' he said, and then for a long time he questioned me closely concerning war.  "He was at first perplexed and incredulous. 'You mean to say,' he asked, seeking confirmation, 'that you run about over the surface of your world--this world, whose riches you have scarcely begun to scrape--killing one another for beasts to eat?'  "I told him that was perfectly correct.  "He asked for particulars to assist his imagination.  "'But do not ships and your poor little cities get injured?' he asked, and I found the waste of property and conveniences seemed to impress him almost as much as the killing. 'Tell me more,' said the Grand Lunar; 'make me see pictures. I cannot conceive these things.'  "And so, for a space, though something loath, I told him the story of earthly War.  "I told him of the first orders and ceremonies of war, of warnings and ultimatums, and the marshalling and marching of troops. I gave him an idea of manoeuvres and positions and battle joined. I told him of sieges and assaults, of starvation and hardship in trenches, and of sentinels freezing in the snow. I told him of routs and surprises, and desperate last stands and faint hopes, and the pitiless pursuit of fugitives and the dead upon the field. I told, too, of the past, of invasions and massacres, of the Huns and Tartars, and the wars of Mahomet and the Caliphs, and of the Crusades. And as I went on, and Phi-oo translated, and the Selenites cooed and murmured in a steadily intensified emotion.  "I told them an ironclad could fire a shot of a ton twelve miles, and go through 20 feet of iron--and how we could steer torpedoes under water. I went on to describe a Maxim gun in action, and what I could imagine of the Battle of Colenso. The Grand Lunar was so incredulous that he interrupted the translation of what I had said in order to have my verification of my account. They particularly doubted my description of the men cheering and rejoicing as they went into battle.  "'But surely they do not like it!' translated Phi-oo.  "I assured them men of my race considered battle the most glorious experience of life, at which the whole assembly was stricken with amazement.  "'But what good is this war?' asked the Grand Lunar, sticking to his theme.  "'Oh! as for _good_!' said I; 'it thins the population!'  "'But why should there be a need--?'  "There came a pause, the cooling sprays impinged upon his brow, and then he spoke again."  [At this point a series of undulations that have been apparent as a perplexing complication as far back as Cavor's description of the silence that fell before the first speaking of the Grand Lunar become confusingly predominant in the record. These undulations are evidently the result of radiations proceeding from a lunar source, and their persistent approximation to the alternating signals of Cavor is curiously suggestive of some operator deliberately seeking to mix them in with his message and render it illegible. At first they are small and regular, so that with a little care and the loss of very few words we have been able to disentangle Cavor's message; then they become broad and larger, then suddenly they are irregular, with an irregularity that gives the effect at last of some one scribbling through a line of writing. For a long time nothing can be made of this madly zigzagging trace; then quite abruptly the interruption ceases, leaves a few words clear, and then resumes and continues for the rest of the message, completely obliterating whatever Cavor was attempting to transmit. Why, if this is indeed a deliberate intervention, the Selenites should have preferred to let Cavor go on transmitting his message in happy ignorance of their obliteration of its record, when it was clearly quite in their power and much more easy and convenient for them to stop his proceedings at any time, is a problem to which I can contribute nothing. The thing seems to have happened so, and that is all I can say. This last rag of his description of the Grand Lunar begins in mid-sentence.]  "...interrogated me very closely upon my secret. I was able in a little while to get to an understanding with them, and at last to elucidate what has been a puzzle to me ever since I realised the vastness of their science, namely, how it is they themselves have never discovered 'Cavorite.' I find they know of it as a theoretical substance, but they have always regarded it as a practical impossibility, because for some reason there is no helium in the moon, and helium..."  [Across the last letters of helium slashes the resumption of that obliterating trace. Note that word "secret," for that, and that alone, I base my interpretation of the message that follows, the last message, as both Mr. Wendigee and myself now believe it to be, that he is ever likely to send us.]      Chapter 26     The Last Message Cavor sent to the Earth  On this unsatisfactory manner the penultimate message of Cavor dies out. One seems to see him away there in the blue obscurity amidst his apparatus intently signalling us to the last, all unaware of the curtain of confusion that drops between us; all unaware, too, of the final dangers that even then must have been creeping upon him. His disastrous want of vulgar common sense had utterly betrayed him. He had talked of war, he had talked of all the strength and irrational violence of men, of their insatiable aggressions, their tireless futility of conflict. He had filled the whole moon world with this impression of our race, and then I think it is plain that he made the most fatal admission that upon himself alone hung the possibility--at least for a long time--of any further men reaching the moon. The line the cold, inhuman reason of the moon would take seems plain enough to me, and a suspicion of it, and then perhaps some sudden sharp realisation of it, must have come to him. One imagines him about the moon with the remorse of this fatal indiscretion growing in his mind. During a certain time I am inclined to guess the Grand Lunar was deliberating the new situation, and for all that time Cavor may have gone as free as ever he had gone. But obstacles of some sort prevented his getting to his electromagnetic apparatus again after that message I have just given. For some days we received nothing. Perhaps he was having fresh audiences, and trying to evade his previous admissions. Who can hope to guess?  And then suddenly, like a cry in the night, like a cry that is followed by a stillness, came the last message. It is the briefest fragment, the broken beginnings of two sentences.  The first was: "I was mad to let the Grand Lunar know--"  There was an interval of perhaps a minute. One imagines some interruption from without. A departure from the instrument--a dreadful hesitation among the looming masses of apparatus in that dim, blue-lit cavern--a sudden rush back to it, full of a resolve that came too late. Then, as if it were hastily transmitted came: "Cavorite made as follows: take--"  There followed one word, a quite unmeaning word as it stands: "uless."  And that is all.  It may be he made a hasty attempt to spell "useless" when his fate was close upon him. Whatever it was that was happening about that apparatus we cannot tell. Whatever it was we shall never, I know, receive another message from the moon. For my own part a vivid dream has come to my help, and I see, almost as plainly as though I had seen it in actual fact, a blue-lit shadowy dishevelled Cavor struggling in the grip of these insect Selenites, struggling ever more desperately and hopelessly as they press upon him, shouting, expostulating, perhaps even at last fighting, and being forced backwards step by step out of all speech or sign of his fellows, for evermore into the Unknown--into the dark, into that silence that has no endReturn to Pleasure Island =========================  George twiddled his thumbs in his booth and watched how the brown, clayey knuckles danced overtop of one another. Not as supple as they had once been, his thumbs -- no longer the texture of wet clay on a potter's wheel; more like clay after it had been worked to exhausted crackling and brittleness. He reached into the swirling vortex of the cotton-candy machine with his strong right hand and caught the stainless-steel sweep-arm. The engines whined and he felt them strain against his strong right arm, like a live thing struggling to escape a trap. Still strong, he thought, still strong, and he released the sweep-arm to go back to spinning sugar into floss.  A pack of boys sauntered down the midway, laughing and calling, bouncing high on sugar and g-stresses. One of them peeled off from the group and ran to his booth, still laughing at some cruelty. He put his palms on George's counter and pushed against it, using them to lever his little body in a high-speed pogo. "Hey, mister," he said, "how about some three-color swirl, with sprinkles?"  George smiled and knocked the rack of paper cones with his strong right elbow, jostled it so one cone spun high in the air, and he caught it in his quick left hand. "Coming _riiiiiight_ up," he sang, and flipped the cone into the floss-machine. He spun a beehive of pink, then layered it with stripes of blue and green. He reached for the nipple that dispensed the sprinkles, but before he turned its spigot, he said, "Are you sure you don't want a dip, too? Fudge? Butterscotch? Strawberry?"  The boy bounced even higher, so that he was nearly vaulting the counter. "All three! All three!" he said.  George expertly spiraled the floss through the dips, then applied a thick crust of sprinkles. "Open your mouth, kid!" he shouted, with realistic glee.  The boy opened his mouth wide, so that the twinkling lights of the midway reflected off his back molars and the pool of saliva on his tongue. George's quick, clever left hand dipped a long-handled spoon into the hot fudge, then flipped the sticky gob on a high arc that terminated perfectly in the boy's open mouth. The boy swallowed and laughed gooely. George handed over the dripping confection in his strong right hand, and the boy plunged his face into it. When he whirled and ran to rejoin his friends, George saw that his ears were already getting longer, and his delighted laugh had sounded a little like a bray. A job well done, he thought, and watched the rain spatter the spongy rubber cobbles of the midway.  #  George was supposed to go off-shift at midnight. He always showed up promptly at noon, but he rarely left as punctually. The soft one who had the midnight-to-six shift was lazy and late, and generally staggered in at twelve thirty, grumbling about his tiredness. George knew how to deal with the soft ones, though -- his father had brought him up surrounded by them, so that he spoke without his father's thick accent, so that he never inadvertently crushed their soft hands when he shook with them, so that he smiled good-naturedly and gave up a realistic facsimile of sympathy when they griped their perennial gripes.  His father! How wise the old man had been, and how proud, and how _stupid_. George shucked his uniform backstage and tossed it into a laundry hamper, noting with dismay how brown the insides were, how much of himself had eroded away during his shift. He looked at his clever left thumb and his strong right thumb, and tasted their good, earthy tastes, and then put them away. He dressed himself in the earth-coloured dungarees and workshirt that his own father had stolen from a laundry line when he left the ancestral home of George's people for the society of the soft ones.  He boarded a Cast Member tram that ran through the ultidors underneath Pleasure Island's midway, and stared aimlessly at nothing as the soft ones on the tram gabbled away, as the tram sped away to the Cast housing, and then it was just him and the conductor, all the way to the end of the line, to the cottage he shared with his two brothers, Bill and Joe. The conductor wished him a good night when he debarked, and he shambled home.  Bill was already home, napping in the pile of blankets that all three brothers shared in the back room of the cottage. Joe wasn't home yet, even though his shift finished earlier than theirs. He never came straight home; instead, he wandered backstage, watching the midway through the peepholes. Joe's Lead had spoken to George about it, and George had spoken to Joe, but you couldn't tell Joe anything. George thought of how proud his father had been, having three sons -- three! George, the son of his strong right thumb, and Bill, the son of his clever left thumb, and Joe. Joe, the son of his tongue, an old man's folly, that left him wordless for the remainder of his days. He hadn't needed words, though: his cracked and rheumy eyes had shone with pride every time they lit on Joe, and the boy could do no wrong by him.  George busied himself with supper for his brothers. In the little wooded area behind the cottage, he found good, clean earth with juicy roots in it. In the freezer, he had a jar of elephant-dung sauce, spiced with the wrung-out sweat of the big top acrobats' leotards, which, even after reheating, still carried the tang of vitality. Preparing a good meal for his kind meant a balance of earthy things and living things, things to keep the hands supple and things to make them strong, and so he brought in a chicken from the brothers' henhouse and covered it in the sloppy green-brown sauce, feathers and all. Bill, being the clever one, woke when the smell of the sauce bubbling in the microwave reached him, and he wandered into the kitchen.  To an untutored eye, Bill and George were indistinguishable. Both of them big, even for their kind -- for their father had been an especially big specimen himself -- whose faces were as expressive as sculptor's clay, whose chisel-shaped teeth were white and hard as rocks. When they were alone together, they went without clothing, as was the custom of their kind, and their bodies bulged with baggy, loose muscle. They needed no clothing, for they lacked the shame of the soft ones, the small thumb between the legs. They had a more civilised way of reproducing.  "Joe hasn't returned yet?" Bill asked his strong brother.  "Not yet," George told his clever brother.  "We eat, then. No sense in waiting for him. He knows the supper hour," Bill said, and since he was the clever one, they ate.  #  Joe returned as the sun was rising, and burrowed in between his brothers on their nest of blankets. George flung one leg over his smallest brother, and smelled the liquor on his breath in his sleep, and his dreams were tainted with the stink of rotting grapes.  George was the first one awake, preparing the morning meal. A maggoty side of beef, ripe with the vitality of its parasites, and gravel. Joe came for breakfast before Bill, as was his custom. Bill needed the sleep, to rest his cleverness.  "God-_damn_, I am _hungry!_," Joe said loudly, without regard for his sleeping brother.  "You missed dinner," George said.  "I had more important things to do," Joe said. "I was out with an Imagineer!"  George stared hard at him. "What did the Imagineer want? Is there trouble?"  Joe gave a deprecating laugh. "Why do you always think there's trouble? The guy wanted to chat with me -- he likes me, wants to get to know me. His name is Woodrow, he's in charge of a whole operations division, and he was interested in what I thought of some of his plans." He stopped and waited for George to be impressed.  George knew what the pause was for. "That's very good. You must be doing a good job for your Lead to mention you to him."  "That little prick? He hates my guts. Woodrow's building a special operations unit out of lateral thinkers -- he wants new blood, creativity. He says I have a unique perspective."  "Did you talk to Orville?" Orville was the soft one who'd brought them from their father's shack to the Island, and he was their mentor and advocate inside its Byzantine politics. Bill had confided to George that he suspected Orville was of a different species from the soft ones -- he certainly seemed to know more about George's kind than a soft one had any business knowing.  Joe tore a hunk from the carcass on the rickety kitchen table and stuffed it into his mouth. Around it, he mumbled something that might have been yes and might have been no. It was Joe's favorite stratagem, and it was responsible for the round belly that bulged out beneath his skinny chest.  Joe tore away more than half of the meat and made for the door. "Woodrow wants to meet with me again this morning. Don't wait up for me tonight!" He left the cottage and set off toward the tram-stop.  Bill rolled over on his bedding and said, "I don't like this at all."  George kept quiet. Bill's voice surprised him, but it shouldn't have. Bill was clever enough to lie still and feign sleep so that he could overhear Joe's conversations, where George would have just sat up and started talking.  "Orville should know about this, but I can't tell if it would make him angry. If it made him angry and he punished Joe, it would be our fault for telling him."  "Then we won't tell him," George said.  Bill held up his hand. "But if we don't tell him and he finds out on his own, he may be angry with us."  "Then we should tell him," George said.  "But Joe and this Woodrow may not get along after all, and if that happens, the whole thing will end on its own."  "Then we won't tell him," George said.  "But if they do get along, then they may do something that would make Orville angry," Bill looked expectantly at George.  "Then we should tell him?" George said, uncertainly.  "I don't know," Bill said. "I haven't decided."  George knew that this mean that Bill would have to think on it, and so he left him. He had to catch the tram to make it to his shift, anyway.  #  The soft one with the six-to-noon shift left as soon as George arrived, without a word. George was used to soft ones not having anything to say to him, and preferred it that way. He was better off than Bill -- soft ones always wanted to talk to Bill, and he hated it, since they never had anything to say that Bill wanted to know. The weather needed no discussion, Bill said. And as for the complaints about the shift's Lead, well, one soft one was just about the same as any other, and Orville had told them that at the end of the day, they worked for him, not for any Lead.  Joe liked talking to the soft ones. Joe liked to talk, period. He told the soft ones lies about their childhood in the shack with their father, and told them about how his brothers tormented, and even talked about the weather. When he got back home, he told his brothers all over again, everything he'd told the soft ones.  George had memorised the SOP manual when they came to the Island, five years before. It clearly said that the floor of the booth would be disinfected every three hours, and the surfaces polished clean, and the pots and machines refilled. The soft one with the six-to-noon shift never did any of these things, which could get him disciplined by their Lead, but George didn't complain. He just wiped and disinfected and re-stocked when he arrived, even though he had to be extra careful with the water, so that he didn't wash any of himself away.  Boys ran up and down the midway, baking in the mid-day sun. They reminded George of the boys he'd gone to school with, after the social worker had come to his father's shack. They'd teased him to begin with, but he'd just stood with his hands at his sides until they stopped. Every time he started a new grade, or a new kid came to the school, it was the same: they'd tease him, or hit him, or throw things at him, and he'd stand strong and silent until they stopped, even if it took months. His teachers quickly learned that calling on him in class meant standing in awkward silence, while he sat stoic and waited for them to call on someone else. The social worker could make him go to school with the soft ones, but she couldn't make him act like one.  George watched the boys carefully, as carefully as he had when he stood silently in the schoolyard, not seeming to watch anything. He was better at spotting a donkey than any of the soft ones. When a boy was ready to turn, George could almost see the shape of the donkey superimposed on the boy, and he radioed a keeper to pick up the donkey come morning. He got a bonus for each one he spotted, and according to Bill, it had accumulated to a sizable nest-egg.  George looked at the inventory and decided that the fudge was getting a little long in the tooth. He'd start pushing fudge-nut dips, and by the end of his shift, the tub would be empty and he'd be able to give it a thorough cleaning and a refill from fresh stock. "Hey guys!" he called to three boys. "Is anybody _hungry_?" He dipped a floss and held it up, so that it oozed fudge down his wrist. The boys shyly approached his booth. George knew from their manner that they were new to the Island: probably just picked up from a video-arcade or lasertag tent on the mainland that afternoon. They didn't know what to make of their surroundings, that was clear.  "Step right up," he said, "I don't bite!" He smiled a smile he'd practiced in the mirror, one that shaped his soft, flexible features into a good-natured expression of idiotic fun. Cautiously, the boys came forward. They were the target age, eleven-to-fourteen, and they'd already accumulated some merch, baseball hats and fanny packs made from neoprene in tropical-fish colours, emblazoned with the Island's logomarks and character trademarks. They had the beginnings of dark circles under their eyes, and they dragged a little with low blood-sugar. George dipped two more and distributed them around. The eldest, a towheaded kid near the upper age range, said, "Mister, we haven't got any money -- what do these cost?"  George laughed like a freight train. "It's all free, sonny, free as air! Courtesy of the Management, as a reward for very _special_ customers like you." This was scripted, but the trick was to sell the line like it was fresh.  The boys took the cones from him timidly, but ate ravenously. George gave them some logoed serviettes to wipe up with and ground the fudge into his wrists and forearms with one of his own. He looked at his watch and consulted the laminated timetable taped to the counter. 1300h, which meant that the bulk of the Guests would be migrating towards Actionland and the dinosaur rides, and it was time to push the slightly down-at-the-heels FreakZone, to balance the crowds. "You boys like rollercoasters?" he said.  The youngest -- they were similar enough in appearance and distant enough in ages to be brothers -- spoke up. "Yeah!" The middle elbowed him, and the youngest flipped the middle the bird.  "Well, if you follow the midway around this curve to the right, and go through the big clown-mouth, you'll be in the FreakZone. We've got a fifteen-storey coaster called _The Obliterator_ that loops fifty times in five minutes -- running over _ninety-five miles per hour_! If you hurry, you can beat the line!" He looked the youngest in the eye at the start of the speech, then switched to the middle when he talked about the line.  The youngest started vibrating with excitement, and the middle looked pensive, and then to the eldest said, "Sounds good, huh, Tom?"  The eldest said, "We haven't even found out where we're sleeping yet -- maybe we can do the ride afterwards."  George winked at the youngest, then said, "Don't worry about it, kids. I'll get that sorted out for you right now." He picked up the white house phone and asked the operator to connect him with Guest Services. "Hi there! This is George on the midway! I need reservations for three young men for tonight -- a suite, I think, with in-room Nintendo and a big-screen TV. They look like they'd enjoy the Sportaseum. OK, I'll hold," he covered the mouthpiece and said to the boys, "You'll love the Sportaseum -- the chairs are shaped like giant catcher's mitts, and the beds are giant Air Jordans, and the suite comes with a regulation half-court. What name should I put the reservation under?"  The eldest said, "Tom Mitchell."  George made the reservation. "You're all set," he said. "The monorails run right into the hotel lobby, every ten minutes. Anyone with a name tag can show you to the nearest stop. Here's a tip -- try the football panzerotto: it's a fried pizza turnover as big as a football, with beef-jerky laces. It's _my_ favorite!"  "I want a football!" the youngest said.  "We'll have it for dinner," the eldest said, looking off at the skyline of coaster-skeletons in the distance. "Let's go on some rides first."  George beamed his idiot's grin at them as they left, then his face went slack and he went back to wiping down the surfaces. A moment later, a hand reached across the counter and plucked the cloth from his grip. He looked up, startled, into Joe's grinning face. Unlike his brothers', Joe's face was all sharp angles and small teeth. Nobody knew what a child of a tongue was supposed to look like, but George had always suspected that Joe wasn't right, even for a third son.  "Big guy!" Joe shouted. "Workin' hard?"  George said, "Yes." He stood, patiently, waiting for Joe to give him the cloth back.  Joe held it over his head like a standard, dancing back out of reach, even though George hadn't made a grab for it. George waited. Joe walked back to his counter and gave it back.  "We're dozing the FreakZone," Joe said, in a conspiratorial whisper. He put a spin on _We're_, making sure that George knew he was including himself with the Island's management.  "Really," George said, neutrally.  "Yeah! We're gonna flatten that sucker, start fresh, and build us a new theme land. I'm a Strategic Project Consultant! By the time it's over, I'll be an Imagineer!"  George knew that the lands on Pleasure Island were flattened and rebuilt on a regular basis, as management worked to stay ahead of the lightspeed boredom-threshold of the mainland. Still, he said, "Well, Joe, that's marvelous. I'm sure you'll do a fabulous job."  Joe sneered at him. "Oh, I know I will. We all do just _fabulous_ jobs, brother. Just some of us _have_ fabulous jobs to do."  George refused to rise to the bait. He could always outwait Joe.  Joe said, "We're thinking of giving it a monster theme -- monsters are testing very high with eleven-to-fourteens this year. Dragons, ogres, cyborgs, you know. We may even do a walk-through -- there hasn't been one of those here since the sixties!"  George didn't know what Joe wanted him to say. He said, "That sounds very nice."  Joe gave him a pitying look, and then his chest started ringing. He extracted a slim phone from his shirt-pocket and turned away. A moment later, he turned back. "Gotta go!" he said. "Meeting with Woodrow and Orville, down at Ops!"  Alarm-bells went off in George's head. "Shouldn't Bill go along if you're meeting with Orville?"  Joe sneered at him, then took off at a fast clip down the midway. George watched him until he disappeared through one of the access doors.  #  Bill was clearly upset about it. George couldn't help but feel responsible. He should have called Bill as soon as Joe told him he was meeting with Orville, but he'd waited until he got home.  He'd been home for hours, and Joe still wasn't back. Bill picked absently at the dinner he'd made and fretted.  "He didn't say how Orville found out?" Bill asked.  George shook his head mutely.  "Why didn't he invite me?" Bill asked. "I always handle negotiations for us."  George couldn't eat. The more Bill fretted, the more he couldn't eat. It was long dark outside, hours and hours after Joe should've been home. Bill fretted, George stared out the window, and Joe didn't come home.  Then, an electric cart's headlights swept up the trail to their cabin. The lights dazzled George, so he couldn't see who was driving. Bill joined him at the window and squinted. "It's Joe and Orville!" he said. George squinted too, but couldn't make anything out. He took Bill's word for it and joined him outside.  It was indeed Orville and Joe. Orville was driving, and Joe was lolling drunkenly beside him. Orville shook hands with Bill and nodded to George, who lifted Joe out of the cart and carried him inside.  When he got back, Orville and Bill were staring calmly into each other's eyes, each waiting for the other to say something. Orville was dressed in his working clothes: a natty white suit with a sport-shirt underneath. His bald head gleamed in the moonlight. His fleshy, unreadable face was ruddy in the glow from the cabin's door. George bit his tongue to keep from speaking.  "He's drunk," Orville said, at last. Orville didn't beat around the bush.  "I can see that," Bill said. "Did you get him drunk?"  "Yes, I did. We were celebrating."  Bill's eyes narrowed. "So you know."  Orville smiled. "Of course I know. I set it up. I thought you'd approve: Joe clearly needed something to keep him out of trouble."  Bill said, "This will keep him out of trouble?"  Orville leaned against the cart's bumper, pulled out a pipe, stuffed it and lit it. He puffed at it, and watched the smoke wisp away in the swamp breezes. "I think that Joe's going to really like life with the Imagineers. They're Management's precious darlings who can do no wrong. Anything they ask for, they get. There won't be any more discipline problems."  Bill said, "Why not?"  Orville grinned without showing his teeth. "Where there's no discipline, there're no discipline problems. He can work whatever hours he wants. He'll have access to anything he needs: budget, staff, an office, whatever. It's his dream job."  Bill said, "I don't like this."  George wondered why not. It sounded pretty good to him.  Orville puffed at his pipe. "Like it or not, I think you'll have a hard time convincing Joe not to do it. He's sold."  Bill went back into the cabin and closed the door.  "He took that well, don't you think?" Orville asked.  George said, "I suppose so."  Orville said, "Is everything working out all right for you? Shifts OK? Co-workers?"  George said, "Everything's fine. Thank you."  Orville tapped his pipe out on the bumper, then got back into the cart. "All right then. Good night, George."  #  George started cooking dinner for two. More and more, Joe spent the night in a suite at one of the hotels, "working late." George didn't know what sort of work he was doing, but he sure seemed to enjoy it. He hardly came back to the cabin at all. The first time he'd stayed out all night, Bill had gone back to the Island and gotten Orville out of bed to help him search. After that, Joe started sending out a runner, usually some poor Ops trainee, to tell them he wasn't coming back for dinner. Eventually, he stopped bothering, and Bill stopped worrying.  One night, a month after Orville had come out to the cabin, George slathered a muskrat's carcass with mayonnaise and lemon and dragonfly eggs and set it out for him and Joe.  Bill hardly ate, which was usually a signal that he was thinking. George left him half of the dinner and waited for him to speak. Bill picked his way through the rest, then pushed his plate away. George cleared it and brought them both mason jars full of muddy water from the swamp out back. Bill took his jar out front of the cabin and leaned against the wall and stared out into the night, sipping. George joined him.  "We're getting old," Bill said, at last.  "Every night, the inside of my uniform is black," George said.  "Mine, too. We're getting very old. I think that you're at least thirty, and I'm pretty sure that I'm twenty-five. That's old. Our father told me that he thought he was fifty, the year he died. And he was very old for one of us."  George thought of their father on his deathbed, eating the food they chewed for him, eyes nearly blind, skin crazed with cracks. "He was very old," George said.  Bill held his two whole hands up against the stars. "When father was my age, he had two sons. Can you remember how proud he was of us? How proud he was of himself? He'd done well enough that he could lose both his thumbs, and still know that his sons would take care of him."  George shifted and sighed. He'd been thinking about sons, too.  "I've wanted a son since we came to the Island," Bill said. "I never did anything about it because I couldn't take care of Joe and a son." Bill turned to look at George. "I think Joe's finally taking care of himself."  George didn't know what to say. If Bill had a son, then he couldn't. They couldn't both stop working to raise their sons. But Bill always made the decisions for them. George didn't know what to say, so he said nothing.  "I'm going to have a son," Bill said.  #  Bill did it the next night. He told Orville that he'd need a month off, and after eating the dinner George made for them, he made a nest of earth and blankets on the floor of their cabin.  George sat in the corner and watched Bill as he stared at his thumbs. It was the most important decision one of their kind ever made: a clever son of the left hand, or a strong son of the right. George knew that his son would come from the left hand. In the world his father had put them into, cleverness was far more important than strength. After all, Bill was having the first son.  Bill put his clever left thumb in his mouth and slowly, slowly, bit down. George felt muddy tears pricking at his eyes. Bill's hand coursed with silty blood. He ignored it, and used his strong right hand to take the severed thumb from his mouth and bed it down with infinite care in the nest he'd built.  George cautiously moved forward to peer at the thumb, which was already moving blindly in its nest, twisting like a grub. Bill looked on, his eyes shining.  "It's perfect," George breathed.  George felt an uncharacteristic welling up inside him, and he put his arm around Bill's shoulders. Bill leaned into him, and said, "Thank you, George. This family wouldn't exist without you."  They both slept curled around the nest that night.  By morning, the thumb had sprouted tiny arm- and leg-buds, and it inched itself blindly around the nest. George marveled at it before going to work.  Joe stopped by his stand that day. His belly was bigger than ever, and his skin was cracking like their father's had. "Big guy!" he shouted, vaulting the counter into George's stand. "Where's Bill today? He wasn't at his post."  George said, "Bill had a son last night. From his left hand."  Joe rolled his eyes, which had gone the murky yellow of swamp water. "Wonderful, right? Ugh. There are better ways to achieve immortality, bro. I'm designing a crawl-through for HorrorZone: you're an earthworm crawling underneath a graveyard. It's gonna be huge: maggots as big as horses, chasing the Guests through the tunnels; huge ghost hands grabbing at them. We're building a giant tombstone as the weenie, you'll be able to see it from anywhere on the Island. We'll build out over the midway for HorrorZone -- it's the biggest rehab we've done since they brought in electric power."  As usual, George didn't know what to say to Joe. "That sounds very nice," he said.  Joe rolled his eyes again and started to say something, but stopped when three Guests came up to George's booth. George hardly recognised the Mitchell brothers. The youngest was already three-quarters donkey, so dangerously close that it was a miracle he hadn't been picked up already. He was hunched over, and his hands were fused into fists. His hair had grown down over his shoulders in a coarse mane, and his lips bulged around his elongated jaws.  The middle and eldest were well on their ways, too. The points of their ears poked out from under their hair, and they carried themselves painfully, forcing their legs and hips upright.  George flipped over his phone and punched 911, but left it out of sight below the counter. Loudly, he said, "Come on over, boys! You look like you could use one of George's triple-dips, the best on the midway!"  From the phone, he heard the security operator say, "Thank you, George, we'll be along in a moment." Surreptitiously, he racked the receiver and smiled at the boys.  "How are you enjoying your stay, boys?" he said.  "It'th aw-thome!" the youngest said around his clumsy teeth.  George handed him a cone piled high with floss, then started building two more for his brothers. Joe smirked at them. George hoped he wouldn't say anything before security got there.  The eldest said, "I don't think my brother's feeling too good. Is there a doctor here I can take him to?"  The youngest, face sticky with confection, kicked his brother. "I'm fine!" he said. "I wanna go on more rideth!"  His brother said, "We'll go on more rides after we see a doctor."  The youngest dropped to his knees and cried. "No!" he said, hammering his fists on the ground. "No no no no!" George watched in alarm as the boy went all the way over to donkey. His cries turned to brays, and his shorts split around his haunches and tail. His shirt went next, and George smoothly vaulted the counter and stood in front of the donkey, blocking him from passers-by. The other two made a run for it. George snagged the middle by his collar, but the boy tore free and took off down the midway. George looked about wildly for security, but they still hadn't arrived.  Then Joe tore past him, moving faster than George had ever seen him go. He caught the boys and stuffed one under each arm, kicking and squirming. He grinned ferociously as he pinned them beneath his knees at George's feet. He clamped his hands over their mouths. "Got 'em!" he said to George.  A security team emerged from the utilidor beside George's booth, wearing clown makeup and baggy pants. Two of them tranquilised the boys and the third fitted the donkey out with a halter and bit. The clown slapped the donkey's haunch appreciatively. "He's a healthy one."  The security team disappeared down the utilidor with the Mitchell brothers: two boys and a donkey. Joe smacked George on the back. "Did you see me catch them? Like greased lightning! Bounty, here I come!"  George didn't mind sharing his bounty with Joe, so he just smiled and nodded and went back around to his booth.  #  Bill named his son Tom. Names weren't very important to their people, but the soft ones' world demanded them. Within a week, Tom was eagerly toddling through their cabin, tasting everything, exploring everything. His eyes shone with curious brilliance. The clever son of a clever son.  George loved Bill's son. He loved to watch Tom as he gnawed at their bedding, as he dug at the floor in search of grubs. Tom was clearly delighted with his surroundings, and George basked in Tom's delight. Bill could barely restrain himself from picking Tom up and hugging him every moment. The only time he left George alone with Tom was a few precious moments after each evening's meal, when he would duck into the woods to find some new toy for Tom: a crippled chipmunk; a handful of pretty rocks; a discarded beer can. The son built bizarre towers out of them, then knocked them down in a fit of giggles. Tom ate all day long, and spoke a steady stream of adorable nonsense.  Bill hardly spoke to George. Their evening meals were given over to watching the son eat. George didn't mind. Talking to the Guests all day wore him out.  When Tom was two months old, Joe came by George's booth.  "Well, it's final. Tomorrow, we shut down the midway. Too old-fashioned -- it's only stood this long because some of the older Imagineers had an emotional attachment to it. I told 'em: 'That's _your_ demographic, not the _target_ demographic.' So we're knocking it down. HorrorZone's gonna be _huge_." He skipped off before George could say anything. His ears were long and pointed. It wasn't the first time George noticed it, but now, he could see that Joe's hunched-over gait wasn't just because of his belly.  George built a dozen cones for the Guests, but his heart wasn't in it. Besides, most of the Guests already had their hands full of gummi spiders and snakes, from the Actionland Jungle Treats buffet. His thoughts were full of Joe, and he turned them over in his slow, cautious manner. Joe was turning into a donkey. He didn't think that one of their kind could turn into a donkey, but this was Pleasure Island. Indulging your vices was a dangerous pastime here. He should tell Bill, but there was no phone at the cabin. He couldn't send a runner for him, because this was family business. His shift wouldn't end for hours yet, and this was too important to wait.  Finally, he called his Lead. "I have to get offstage. I'm having a bad day."  Technically, this was allowed. Management didn't want anyone onstage who wasn't 100 percent. But it was something that none of the brothers, not even Joe, had ever done. The Lead was surprised, but he sent over a soft one to relieve George.  #  Orville and Bill were sitting out front of the cabin, watching Tom, when George got back. He wrung his hands as he approached them, not sure of what to say, and whether he should talk in front of Orville at all. He held his left thumb in his right hand, and it comforted him, a little.  Bill and Orville were so engrossed in Tom's antics that they didn't even notice George until he cleared his throat. Orville raised his eyebrows and looked significantly at Bill.  "I just saw Joe," George said. "On the midway. His ears are pointed, and he's walking all hunched over. I give him a few days at the most before he's all the way gone." George held his breath, waiting for Bill's reaction.  "Too bad," Bill said. "It was inevitable, I suppose. A child of the tongue! What was father thinking?"  Orville smiled and puffed at his pipe. "Don't you worry about it, George. Joe's going to be much, much happier. Focussed. If you'd like, I can bring him out here to live. Little Tom could have pony rides."  Bill said, "I don't think that's such a good idea. Joe's too wild to play with a child."  Orville put a hand on his shoulder. "You'd be amazed at how docile he'll become."  Bill scooped up Tom, who was up to his waist now, and who liked to grab onto Bill's nose. "We'll see, then." He retreated into the cabin with his son.  Orville turned to George and said, "You've probably heard that we're taking down the midway tomorrow. The others are all being reassigned until the rehab is done, but I thought I'd see if I could get you a couple months off. You could stay here and play with Tom -- it's not every day you get to be a new uncle."  Orville had always taken obvious pleasure in the transformation of boys into donkeys. It was the whole why of Pleasure Island, after all. Orville seemed especially pleased tonight, and George thought that he was as surprised about Bill as George was.  George, not knowing what to say to any of it, said nothing.  #  It didn't take long for George to start missing the midway. Stuck at the cabin with Bill and Tom, he sat against an outside wall and tried not to get in the way. He prepared meals in silence, taking a long time in the woods, gathering up choice morsels. Bill and Tom ate on the floor, away from the table. Bill chewed the tougher morsels first, and then put them in Tom's mouth with his crippled left hand. Most of the time, neither of them took any notice of George.  One day, he prepared a whole day's worth of meals and left them on the table, then walked to the utilidor at the other side of the woods. He boarded a tram and rode to the old midway entrance.  The midway was fenced in with tall plywood sheets, and construction crews bustled over the naked skeletons of the new HorrorZone. Heavy machinery groaned and crashed. Nothing but the distant silhouettes of Actionland's skyline were familiar. George tried to imagine working here for years to come. An overwhelming tiredness weighed him down.  He took the tram back to the cabin and stripped off his clothes. They were browner than ever. His arms felt weak and tired. He suddenly knew that he would never have a son of his own.  Bill and Tom were playing out front of the cabin. He sat in his usual spot against the wall and watched them. "Bill," he said, softly.  "Yes?" Bill said.  "When will I have a son of my own?" Bill always knew the answers.  Bill gathered Tom up to his chest unconsciously while he thought. "I suppose that once Tom is grown, you could take some time off and have a son of your own."  To his own surprise, George said, "I want to have a son now."  Bill said, "That's out of the question, George. We're too busy with Tom." On hearing Bill's annoyed tone, Tom leaned into him.  George said, "I'm not busy. I am old, though. If I don't have a son soon, I won't be able to care for it until it's old enough to care for me."  Bill said, "You're thinking like Father. We're living with the soft ones now. Orville will make sure that you and your son will be fine until he's grown."  George never won arguments with Bill. He went inside the cabin and set out dinner.  #  Orville visited the brothers the next morning. He chucked Tom under the chin and shook hands with Bill. Then he took George out into the woods for a walk.  "Your brother tells me you want a son of your own," he said.  George nodded, and stooped to put a small, mossy log in his basket.  "Bill doesn't want you to, huh?"  George didn't feel very comfortable discussing the family with Orville. That was Bill's job. After some thought, he said, "Not right now."  Orville said, "I can see that that makes you unhappy. No one should be unhappy here. I'll see what I can do. Come down to Ops tomorrow morning, we'll talk more."  When George got back to the cabin, Bill was lying on his back on the floor, laughing while Tom climbed all over him. Tom still babbled, but they were real words now, though nonsensical. With his constant talking, he reminded George of Joe, and that made him even sadder.  #  George had never been to Ops before, but he knew where it was, in a collection of low-slung prefab buildings hidden behind the topiary sculptures near MagicLand. He clutched his right thumb nervously as he stood and waited in the reception area for Orville to come and get him. The secretary had taken his name and buzzed Orville, and now kept sneaking him horrified looks. George's family were the only of their kind to leave their homeland and join the soft ones, and here at Ops, there were any number of low-ranking babus who'd never heard tell of them.  Orville was all smiles and effusion as he breezed through the glass security-door and pounded George on the back. "George! I'm so _glad_ you came down!"  He took George by the arm and led him away, stopping to wink at the secretary, who looked at him with a mixture of disgust and admiration.  Orville's office was buried in a twisting maze of door-lined, fluorescent-lit corridors, where busy soft ones talked on telephones and clattered on keyboards. He led George through his door, into an office as big as George's cabin.  Orville paced and talked. "Did I say I was glad you came? I'm glad you came. Now, let's talk about Bill. Bill's happy. He's got what he wants. A son. He doesn't have to take care of Joe. It's good for him."  He paused and looked at George. George nodded.  "OK. There's a problem, though. You want a son, too, only Bill won't allow it."  It didn't need any comment, so George kept quiet.  "My thinking is, Bill's so busy with Tom, he wouldn't really notice if you were there or not. You're an adult, you can take care of yourself. Do you see where I'm going with this?"  George assumed it was a rhetorical question.  "Right. What I'm thinking is, there's no reason that both of you shouldn't have your own son. This is Pleasure Island, after all. No one should be sad on Pleasure Island. You've worked hard and well for us for a long time here. We can take care of you."  George felt an uncomfortable sensation in his stomach, a knot of guilt like rising vomit.  "I thought about having another cabin built in the woods, but that's no good. I think that you and Bill need your own space. So let me bounce my current thought off you: we'll put you up in the new Monster's Arms, that's the hotel we're building for HorrorZone. It's way ahead of schedule, almost finished now. There's a penthouse suite that you can take for as long as you like. It's only temporary, just until you and Bill have had some time to raise up your sons. Then, we'll get the whole family together back at the cabin."  The guilt rose higher, choking George.  "Don't worry about eating, either. I've briefed the house chef on your tastes, and he'll send up three squares every day; everything a growing boy needs." He flashed a grin.  "And forget about Bill. I'll smooth things over with him. He'll see that it's for the best."  Finally, George had something to say. "What about Joe?"  Orville had been almost dancing as he spoke, enchanted with his own words. He pulled up short when George spoke. "What about him?"  "I want to live with him again," George said.  "He's gone, you know that." Orville pointed his fingers alongside his ears. "Hee-haw, hee-haw. The monthly ferry will take him to the mainland tomorrow."  "I don't care about that," George said. "I want him there."  Orville said, "I don't think that's such a good idea, George. You're going away to concentrate on _you_ -- Joe's a handful, even now. I don't want you distracted."  George said, "I want Joe."  Orville stared at him. George set his face into a blank mask. Finally, Orville said, "If that's what you want, that's what you'll get."  #  George didn't have anything to fetch from the cabin, and Orville thought it would be best if he spoke to Bill alone, so he sent George to the stables to get Joe.  The donkey stables were beyond Ops, at the very edge of the island, opposite the docks where the ferries brought new boys in. A different kind of boat docked there, large utility freighters that brought in everything the Island needed and took away braying, kicking herds of jackasses.  The donkeys shifted nervously in their stalls. George smelled horse-apples and hay, and heard fidgeting hooves and quiet, braying sobs. He wasn't clear on what happened to donkeys when they went back to the mainland, but he had an idea that it wasn't very pleasant. On the Island, donkeys were prizes, a sign that a boy's every wish had been gratified. What happened afterwards wasn't something that they were encouraged to think about.  He walked down the clean, wooden aisles, peering into the stalls, looking for Joe. Finally, in a dark stall in the very darkest corner of the stables, he found him. A large, pot-bellied jackass, who leapt up and brayed loudly at him when he clucked his tongue at it.  "Joe?" he asked softly.  The donkey brayed again and kicked at the stall's door. It was already splintered from many such kicks. George opened the catch and was nearly trampled beneath Joe's hooves as he ran out and away, braying loudly. George chased his brother. He didn't start very fast, but once he got going, inertia made him unstoppable.  He cornered Joe at the door that led out to the Island. The donkey was kicking at it, trying for escape. George locked his strong right arm around Joe's neck. "Stop it, Joe," he said. "I'm taking you out with me, but you have to stop it."  Joe's eyes rolled madly, and he struggled against George, kicking and biting. George waited in silence until the donkey tired, then used a bridle hanging on the wall to lead Joe out of the stables.  When Joe saw Orville waiting for them, he went wild again. George caught him by the hind leg and dragged him to the ground, while Orville danced back with a strange grace.  Orville grinned and said, "I guess he doesn't like me very much." He came forward and darted an affectionate pat on Joe's haunch.  Joe brayed loudly and George kept his own counsel. Orville led them down a utilidor and into an electric tram with an open car. George led Joe in and held onto his neck while Orville sped down the utilidor. He drove up a service ramp and out into HorrorZone, then to the doors of the newly completed Monster's Arms.  #  George and Joe lived in the Monster's Arms. Every morning, Orville paid them a visit and snuck looks at George's thumbs. They were intact.  George wanted to have a son, but he couldn't bring himself to do it. Orville's visits grew shorter, and Orville's manner grew more irritated. Still, George had no son.  One day, he waited until Joe was napping, and slipped out through the iron-maiden elevator, right down into the utilidor.  The tram driver recognised him and took him out to the cabin. The last mile of the utilidor was dusty and disused. George leaped off the tram and walked quickly to the cabin, his heart racing. It had been so long since he'd seen Bill and little Tom. He missed them terribly.  The little cabin was even smaller than George remembered it, and it looked sad, sagging and ramshackle. He hesitated at the door, then, feeling a stranger, knocked.  There was movement inside, but no voices, and the door stayed shut. George opened the door.  It was a disaster. The kitchen cupboards were smashed in, the little table knocked over and splintered, the bedding scattered and soiled. Deep shadows collected in the corners.  "Bill?" George called, softly. A shadow stirred, an indistinct figure within its depths.  "Bill, it's George. I missed you. I need to talk with you. I'm confused."  The shadow stirred again. George crept forward, peering, his old eyes night-dimmed.  Bill huddled in the corner, wracked and wasted. He stared up at George through eyes filmed with tears. He held up his hands. They had already begun to shape themselves into hooves, but George could still see that both his thumbs were gone. His ears were pointed and long.  "Oh, Bill," George said.  His brother let out a braying sob, and George saw he had no tongue.  #  Orville came looking for them the next morning.  "Where are the sons?" George asked him, while stroking the donkey's head in his lap.  Orville smiled a slightly abashed smile. "I'm keeping them safe. I didn't think that Bill was in any shape to take care of them."  George said, "I'll take care of them. Bring them here. Joe, too -- he's in the room. I'll take care of them all."  Orville smiled his abashed smile again, then gave George an ironic salute. "Yes, sir," he said. He patted Bill's haunch and smiled to himself.  George didn't know how to respond to irony, so he held his brother more tightly. Eventually, Orville went away, and then came back a while after that. He drove an electric cart. In the front seat, three sons bounced -- Tom, bright and curious; another, strong and big; a third, whose little pot belly jiggled as he talked and talked and talked. In a trailer, Joe kicked and fought against his bonds.  George let him out first, then took the sons to the porch. Joe and Bill stared at each other for a long moment, then Bill brayed out a long, donkeyish laugh.  Orville looked with proprietary satisfaction at the donkeys, then at the sons, then at George. He waggled a finger at George, as if to say, _I'll be back for you, someday_. Then he got into his tram and drove off.  George went back inside and made dinner for his family.      Was this ill-fated expedition the end of a proud, old race--or the      beginning of a new one?       There are strange gaps in our records of the past. We find traces      of man-like things--but, suddenly, man appears, far too much      developed to be the "next step" in a well-linked chain of      evolutionary evidence. Perhaps something like the events of this      story furnishes the answer to the riddle.   Aboard the ship, there was neither day nor night; the hours slipped gently by, as vistas of star-gemmed blackness slid across the visiscreens. For the crew, time had some meaning--one watch on duty and two off. But for the thousand-odd colonists, the men and women who were to be the spearhead of migration to a new and friendlier planet, it had none. They slept, and played, worked at such tasks as they could invent, and slept again, while the huge ship followed her plotted trajectory.  Kalvar Dard, the army officer who would lead them in their new home, had as little to do as any of his followers. The ship's officers had all the responsibility for the voyage, and, for the first time in over five years, he had none at all. He was finding the unaccustomed idleness more wearying than the hectic work of loading the ship before the blastoff from Doorsha. He went over his landing and security plans again, and found no probable emergency unprepared for. Dard wandered about the ship, talking to groups of his colonists, and found morale even better than he had hoped. He spent hours staring into the forward visiscreens, watching the disc of Tareesh, the planet of his destination, grow larger and plainer ahead.  Now, with the voyage almost over, he was in the cargo-hold just aft of the Number Seven bulkhead, with six girls to help him, checking construction material which would be needed immediately after landing. The stuff had all been checked two or three times before, but there was no harm in going over it again. It furnished an occupation to fill in the time; it gave Kalvar Dard an excuse for surrounding himself with half a dozen charming girls, and the girls seemed to enjoy being with him. There was tall blonde Olva, the electromagnetician; pert little Varnis, the machinist's helper; Kyna, the surgeon's-aide; dark-haired Analea; Dorita, the accountant; plump little Eldra, the armament technician. At the moment, they were all sitting on or around the desk in the corner of the store-room, going over the inventory when they were not just gabbling.  "Well, how about the rock-drill bitts?" Dorita was asking earnestly, trying to stick to business. "Won't we need them almost as soon as we're off?"  "Yes, we'll have to dig temporary magazines for our explosives, small-arms and artillery ammunition, and storage-pits for our fissionables and radioactives," Kalvar Dard replied. "We'll have to have safe places for that stuff ready before it can be unloaded; and if we run into hard rock near the surface, we'll have to drill holes for blasting-shots."  "The drilling machinery goes into one of those prefabricated sheds," Eldra considered. "Will there be room in it for all the bitts, too?"  Kalvar Dard shrugged. "Maybe. If not, we'll cut poles and build racks for them outside. The bitts are nono-steel; they can be stored in the open."  "If there are poles to cut," Olva added.  "I'm not worrying about that," Kalvar Dard replied. "We have a pretty fair idea of conditions on Tareesh; our astronomers have been making telescopic observations for the past fifteen centuries. There's a pretty big Arctic ice-cap, but it's been receding slowly, with a wide belt of what's believed to be open grassland to the south of it, and a belt of what's assumed to be evergreen forest south of that. We plan to land somewhere in the northern hemisphere, about the grassland-forest line. And since Tareesh is richer in water that Doorsha, you mustn't think of grassland in terms of our wire-grass plains, or forests in terms of our brush thickets. The vegetation should be much more luxuriant."  "If there's such a large polar ice-cap, the summers ought to be fairly cool, and the winters cold," Varnis reasoned. "I'd think that would mean fur-bearing animals. Colonel, you'll have to shoot me something with a nice soft fur; I like furs."  Kalvar Dard chuckled. "Shoot you nothing, you can shoot your own furs. I've seen your carbine and pistol scores," he began.             *       *       *       *       *  There was a sudden suck of air, disturbing the papers on the desk. They all turned to see one of the ship's rocket-boat bays open; a young Air Force lieutenant named Seldar Glav, who would be staying on Tareesh with them to pilot their aircraft, emerged from an open airlock.  "Don't tell me you've been to Tareesh and back in that thing," Olva greeted him.  Seldar Glav grinned at her. "I could have been, at that; we're only twenty or thirty planetary calibers away, now. We ought to be entering Tareeshan atmosphere by the middle of the next watch. I was only checking the boats, to make sure they'll be ready to launch.... Colonel Kalvar, would you mind stepping over here? There's something I think you should look at, sir."  Kalvar Dard took one arm from around Analea's waist and lifted the other from Varnis' shoulder, sliding off the desk. He followed Glav into the boat-bay; as they went through the airlock, the cheerfulness left the young lieutenant's face.  "I didn't want to say anything in front of the girls, sir," he began, "but I've been checking boats to make sure we can make a quick getaway. Our meteor-security's gone out. The detectors are deader then the Fourth Dynasty, and the blasters won't synchronize.... Did you hear a big thump, about a half an hour ago, Colonel?"  "Yes, I thought the ship's labor-crew was shifting heavy equipment in the hold aft of us. What was it, a meteor-hit?"  "It was. Just aft of Number Ten bulkhead. A meteor about the size of the nose of that rocket-boat."  Kalvar Dard whistled softly. "Great Gods of Power! The detectors must be dead, to pass up anything like that.... Why wasn't a boat-stations call sent out?"  "Captain Vlazil was unwilling to risk starting a panic, sir," the Air Force officer replied. "Really, I'm exceeding my orders in mentioning it to you, but I thought you should know...."  Kalvar Dard swore. "It's a blasted pity Captain Vlazil didn't try thinking! Gold-braided quarter-wit! Maybe his crew might panic, but my people wouldn't.... I'm going to call the control-room and have it out with him. By the Ten Gods...!"         *       *       *       *       *  He ran through the airlock and back into the hold, starting toward the intercom-phone beside the desk. Before he could reach it, there was another heavy jar, rocking the entire ship. He, and Seldar Glav, who had followed him out of the boat-bay, and the six girls, who had risen on hearing their commander's angry voice, were all tumbled into a heap. Dard surged to his feet, dragging Kyna up along with him; together, they helped the others to rise. The ship was suddenly filled with jangling bells, and the red danger-lights on the ceiling were flashing on and off.  "Attention! Attention!" the voice of some officer in the control-room blared out of the intercom-speaker. "The ship has just been hit by a large meteor! All compartments between bulkheads Twelve and Thirteen are sealed off. All persons between bulkheads Twelve and Thirteen, put on oxygen helmets and plug in at the nearest phone connection. Your air is leaking, and you can't get out, but if you put on oxygen equipment immediately, you'll be all right. We'll get you out as soon as we can, and in any case, we are only a few hours out of Tareeshan atmosphere. All persons in Compartment Twelve, put on...."  Kalvar Dard was swearing evilly. "That does it! That does it for good!... Anybody else in this compartment, below the living quarter level?"  "No, we're the only ones," Analea told him.  "The people above have their own boats; they can look after themselves. You girls, get in that boat, in there. Glav, you and I'll try to warn the people above...."  There was another jar, heavier than the one which had preceded it, throwing them all down again. As they rose, a new voice was shouting over the public-address system:  "_Abandon ship! Abandon ship!_ The converters are backfiring, and rocket-fuel is leaking back toward the engine-rooms! An explosion is imminent! Abandon ship, all hands!"  Kalvar Dard and Seldar Glav grabbed the girls and literally threw them through the hatch, into the rocket-boat. Dard pushed Glav in ahead of him, then jumped in. Before he had picked himself up, two or three of the girls were at the hatch, dogging the cover down.  "All right, Glav, blast off!" Dard ordered. "We've got to be at least a hundred miles from this ship when she blows, or we'll blow with her!"  "Don't I know!" Seldar Glav retorted over his shoulder, racing for the controls. "Grab hold of something, everybody; I'm going to fire all jets at once!"  An instant later, while Kalvar Dard and the girls clung to stanchions and pieces of fixed furniture, the boat shot forward out of its housing. When Dard's head had cleared, it was in free flight.  "How was that?" Glav yelled. "Everybody all right?" He hesitated for a moment. "I think I blacked out for about ten seconds."  Kalvar Dard looked the girls over. Eldra was using a corner of her smock to stanch a nosebleed, and Olva had a bruise over one eye. Otherwise, everybody was in good shape.  "Wonder we didn't all black out, permanently," he said. "Well, put on the visiscreens, and let's see what's going on outside. Olva, get on the radio and try to see if anybody else got away."  "Set course for Tareesh?" Glav asked. "We haven't fuel enough to make it back to Doorsha."  "I was afraid of that," Dard nodded. "Tareesh it is; northern hemisphere, daylight side. Try to get about the edge of the temperate zone, as near water as you can...."     2   They were flung off their feet again, this time backward along the boat. As they picked themselves up, Seldar Glav was shaking his head, sadly. "That was the ship going up," he said; "the blast must have caught us dead astern."  "All right." Kalvar Dard rubbed a bruised forehead. "Set course for Tareesh, then cut out the jets till we're ready to land. And get the screens on, somebody; I want to see what's happened."  The screens glowed; then full vision came on. The planet on which they would land loomed huge before them, its north pole toward them, and its single satellite on the port side. There was no sign of any rocket-boat in either side screen, and the rear-view screen was a blur of yellow flame from the jets.  "Cut the jets, Glav," Dard repeated. "Didn't you hear me?"  "But I did, sir!" Seldar Glav indicated the firing-panel. Then he glanced at the rear-view screen. "The gods help us! It's yellow flame; the jets are burning out!"  Kalvar Dard had not boasted idly when he had said that his people would not panic. All the girls went white, and one or two gave low cries of consternation, but that was all.  "What happens next?" Analea wanted to know. "Do we blow, too?"  "Yes, as soon as the fuel-line burns up to the tanks."  "Can you land on Tareesh before then?" Dard asked.  "I can try. How about the satellite? It's closer."  "It's also airless. Look at it and see for yourself," Kalvar Dard advised. "Not enough mass to hold an atmosphere."  Glav looked at the army officer with new respect. He had always been inclined to think of the Frontier Guards as a gang of scientifically illiterate dirk-and-pistol bravos. He fiddled for a while with instruments on the panel; an automatic computer figured the distance to the planet, the boat's velocity, and the time needed for a landing.  "We have a chance, sir," he said. "I think I can set down in about thirty minutes; that should give us about ten minutes to get clear of the boat, before she blows up."  "All right; get busy, girls," Kalvar Dard said. "Grab everything we'll need. Arms and ammunition first; all of them you can find. After that, warm clothing, bedding, tools and food."  With that, he jerked open one of the lockers and began pulling out weapons. He buckled on a pistol and dagger, and handed other weapon-belts to the girls behind him. He found two of the heavy big-game rifles, and several bandoliers of ammunition for them. He tossed out carbines, and boxes of carbine and pistol cartridges. He found two bomb-bags, each containing six light anti-personnel grenades and a big demolition-bomb. Glancing, now and then, at the forward screen, he caught glimpses of blue sky and green-tinted plains below.  "All right!" the pilot yelled. "We're coming in for a landing! A couple of you stand by to get the hatch open."  There was a jolt, and all sense of movement stopped. A cloud of white smoke drifted past the screens. The girls got the hatch open; snatching up weapons and bedding-wrapped bundles they all scrambled up out of the boat.  There was fire outside. The boat had come down upon a grassy plain; now the grass was burning from the heat of the jets. One by one, they ran forward along the top of the rocket-boat, jumping down to the ground clear of the blaze. Then, with every atom of strength they possessed they ran away from the doomed boat.         *       *       *       *       *  The ground was rough, and the grass high, impeding them. One of the girls tripped and fell; without pausing, two others pulled her to her feet, while another snatched up and slung the carbine she had dropped. Then, ahead, Kalvar Dard saw a deep gully, through which a little stream trickled.  They huddled together at the bottom of it, waiting, for what seemed like a long while. Then a gentle tremor ran through the ground, and swelled to a sickening, heaving shock. A roar of almost palpable sound swept over them, and a flash of blue-white light dimmed the sun above. The sound, the shock, and the searing light did not pass away at once; they continued for seconds that seemed like an eternity. Earth and stones pelted down around them; choking dust rose. Then the thunder and the earth-shock were over; above, incandescent vapors swirled, and darkened into an overhanging pall of smoke and dust.  For a while, they crouched motionless, too stunned to speak. Then shaken nerves steadied and jarred brains cleared. They all rose weakly. Trickles of earth were still coming down from the sides of the gully, and the little stream, which had been clear and sparkling, was roiled with mud. Mechanically, Kalvar Dard brushed the dust from his clothes and looked to his weapons.  "That was just the fuel-tank of a little Class-3 rocket-boat," he said. "I wonder what the explosion of the ship was like." He thought for a moment before continuing. "Glav, I think I know why our jets burned out. We were stern-on to the ship when she blew; the blast drove our flame right back through the jets."  "Do you think the explosion was observed from Doorsha?" Dorita inquired, more concerned about the practical aspects of the situation. "The ship, I mean. After all, we have no means of communication, of our own."  "Oh, I shouldn't doubt it; there were observatories all around the planet watching our ship," Kalvar Dard said. "They probably know all about it, by now. But if any of you are thinking about the chances of rescue, forget it. We're stuck here."  "That's right. There isn't another human being within fifty million miles," Seldar Glav said. "And that was the first and only space-ship ever built. It took fifty years to build her, and even allowing twenty for research that wouldn't have to be duplicated, you can figure when we can expect another one."  "The answer to that one is, never. The ship blew up in space; fifty years' effort and fifteen hundred people gone, like that." Kalvar Dard snapped his fingers. "So now, they'll try to keep Doorsha habitable for a few more thousand years by irrigation, and forget about immigrating to Tareesh."  "Well, maybe, in a hundred thousand years, our descendants will build a ship and go to Doorsha, then," Olva considered.  "Our descendants?" Eldra looked at her in surprize. "You mean, then...?"         *       *       *       *       *  Kyna chuckled. "Eldra, you are an awful innocent, about anything that doesn't have a breech-action or a recoil-mechanism," she said. "Why do you think the women on this expedition outnumbered the men seven to five, and why do you think there were so many obstetricians and pediatricians in the med. staff? We were sent out to put a human population on Tareesh, weren't we? Well, here we are."  "But.... Aren't we ever going to...?" Varnis began. "Won't we ever see anybody else, or do anything but just live here, like animals, without machines or ground-cars or aircraft or houses or anything?" Then she began to sob bitterly.  Analea, who had been cleaning a carbine that had gotten covered with loose earth during the explosion, laid it down and went to Varnis, putting her arm around the other girl and comforting her. Kalvar Dard picked up the carbine she had laid down.  "Now, let's see," he began. "We have two heavy rifles, six carbines, and eight pistols, and these two bags of bombs. How much ammunition, counting what's in our belts, do we have?"  They took stock of their slender resources, even Varnis joining in the task, as he had hoped she would. There were over two thousand rounds for the pistols, better than fifteen hundred for the carbines, and four hundred for the two big-game guns. They had some spare clothing, mostly space-suit undergarments, enough bed-robes, one hand-axe, two flashlights, a first-aid kit, and three atomic lighters. Each one had a combat-dagger. There was enough tinned food for about a week.  "We'll have to begin looking for game and edible plants, right away," Glav considered. "I suppose there is game, of some sort; but our ammunition won't last forever."  "We'll have to make it last as long as we can; and we'll have to begin improvising weapons," Dard told him. "Throwing-spears, and throwing-axes. If we can find metal, or any recognizable ore that we can smelt, we'll use that; if not, we'll use chipped stone. Also, we can learn to make snares and traps, after we learn the habits of the animals on this planet. By the time the ammunition's gone, we ought to have learned to do without firearms."  "Think we ought to camp here?"  Kalvar Dard shook his head. "No wood here for fuel, and the blast will have scared away all the game. We'd better go upstream; if we go down, we'll find the water roiled with mud and unfit to drink. And if the game on this planet behave like the game-herds on the wastelands of Doorsha, they'll run for high ground when frightened."  Varnis rose from where she had been sitting. Having mastered her emotions, she was making a deliberate effort to show it.  "Let's make up packs out of this stuff," she suggested. "We can use the bedding and spare clothing to bundle up the food and ammunition."  They made up packs and slung them, then climbed out of the gully. Off to the left, the grass was burning in a wide circle around the crater left by the explosion of the rocket-boat. Kalvar Dard, carrying one of the heavy rifles, took the lead. Beside and a little behind him, Analea walked, her carbine ready. Glav, with the other heavy rifle, brought up in the rear, with Olva covering for him, and between, the other girls walked, two and two.  Ahead, on the far horizon, was a distance-blue line of mountains. The little company turned their faces toward them and moved slowly away, across the empty sea of grass.     3   They had been walking, now, for five years. Kalvar Dard still led, the heavy rifle cradled in the crook of his left arm and a sack of bombs slung from his shoulder, his eyes forever shifting to right and left searching for hidden danger. The clothes in which he had jumped from the rocket-boat were patched and ragged; his shoes had been replaced by high laced buskins of smoke-tanned hide. He was bearded, now, and his hair had been roughly trimmed with the edge of his dagger.  Analea still walked beside him, but her carbine was slung, and she carried three spears with chipped flint heads; one heavy weapon, to be thrown by hand or used for stabbing, and two light javelins to be thrown with the aid of the hooked throwing-stick Glav had invented. Beside her trudged a four-year old boy, hers and Dard's, and on her back, in a fur-lined net bag, she carried their six-month-old baby.  In the rear, Glav still kept his place with the other big-game gun, and Olva walked beside him with carbine and spears; in front of them, their three-year-old daughter toddled. Between vanguard and rearguard, the rest of the party walked: Varnis, carrying her baby on her back, and Dorita, carrying a baby and leading two other children. The baby on her back had cost the life of Kyna in childbirth; one of the others had been left motherless when Eldra had been killed by the Hairy People.         *       *       *       *       *  That had been two years ago, in the winter when they had used one of their two demolition-bombs to blast open a cavern in the mountains. It had been a hard winter; two children had died, then--Kyna's firstborn, and the little son of Kalvar Dard and Dorita. It had been their first encounter with the Hairy People, too.  Eldra had gone outside the cave with one of the skin water-bags, to fill it at the spring. It had been after sunset, but she had carried her pistol, and no one had thought of danger until they heard the two quick shots, and the scream. They had all rushed out, to find four shaggy, manlike things tearing at Eldra with hands and teeth, another lying dead, and a sixth huddled at one side, clutching its abdomen and whimpering. There had been a quick flurry of shots that had felled all four of the assailants, and Seldar Glav had finished the wounded creature with his dagger, but Eldra was dead. They had built a cairn of stones over her body, as they had done over the bodies of the two children killed by the cold. But, after an examination to see what sort of things they were, they had tumbled the bodies of the Hairy People over the cliff. These had been too bestial to bury as befitted human dead, but too manlike to skin and eat as game.  Since then, they had often found traces of the Hairy People, and when they met with them, they killed them without mercy. These were great shambling parodies of humanity, long-armed, short-legged, twice as heavy as men, with close-set reddish eyes and heavy bone-crushing jaws. They may have been incredibly debased humans, or perhaps beasts on the very threshold of manhood. From what he had seen of conditions on this planet, Kalvar Dard suspected the latter to be the case. In a million or so years, they might evolve into something like humanity. Already, the Hairy ones had learned the use of fire, and of chipped crude stone implements--mostly heavy triangular choppers to be used in the hand, without helves.  Twice, after that night, the Hairy People had attacked them--once while they were on the march, and once in camp. Both assaults had been beaten off without loss to themselves, but at cost of precious ammunition. Once they had caught a band of ten of them swimming a river on logs; they had picked them all off from the bank with their carbines. Once, when Kalvar Dard and Analea had been scouting alone, they had come upon a dozen of them huddled around a fire and had wiped them out with a single grenade. Once, a large band of Hairy People hunted them for two days, but only twice had they come close, and both times, a single shot had sent them all scampering. That had been after the bombing of the group around the fire. Dard was convinced that the beings possessed the rudiments of a language, enough to communicate a few simple ideas, such as the fact that this little tribe of aliens were dangerous in the extreme.         *       *       *       *       *  There were Hairy People about now; for the past five days, moving northward through the forest to the open grasslands, the people of Kalvar Dard had found traces of them. Now, as they came out among the seedling growth at the edge of the open plains, everybody was on the alert.  They emerged from the big trees and stopped among the young growth, looking out into the open country. About a mile away, a herd of game was grazing slowly westward. In the distance, they looked like the little horse-like things, no higher than a man's waist and heavily maned and bearded, that had been one of their most important sources of meat. For the ten thousandth time, Dard wished, as he strained his eyes, that somebody had thought to secure a pair of binoculars when they had abandoned the rocket-boat. He studied the grazing herd for a long time.  The seedling pines extended almost to the game-herd and would offer concealment for the approach, but the animals were grazing into the wind, and their scent was much keener than their vision. This would prelude one of their favorite hunting techniques, that of lurking in the high grass ahead of the quarry. It had rained heavily in the past few days, and the undermat of dead grass was soaked, making a fire-hunt impossible. Kalvar Dard knew that he could stalk to within easy carbine-shot, but he was unwilling to use cartridges on game; and in view of the proximity of Hairy People, he did not want to divide his band for a drive hunt.  "What's the scheme?" Analea asked him, realizing the problem as well as he did. "Do we try to take them from behind?"  "We'll take them from an angle," he decided. "We'll start from here and work in, closing on them at the rear of the herd. Unless the wind shifts on us, we ought to get within spear-cast. You and I will use the spears; Varnis can come along and cover for us with a carbine. Glav, you and Olva and Dorita stay here with the children and the packs. Keep a sharp lookout; Hairy People around, somewhere." He unslung his rifle and exchanged it for Olva's spears. "We can only eat about two of them before the meat begins to spoil, but kill all you can," he told Analea; "we need the skins."  Then he and the two girls began their slow, cautious, stalk. As long as the grassland was dotted with young trees, they walked upright, making good time, but the last five hundred yards they had to crawl, stopping often to check the wind, while the horse-herd drifted slowly by. Then they were directly behind the herd, with the wind in their faces, and they advanced more rapidly.  "Close enough?" Dard whispered to Analea.  "Yes; I'm taking the one that's lagging a little behind."  "I'm taking the one on the left of it." Kalvar Dard fitted a javelin to the hook of his throwing-stick. "Ready? Now!"  He leaped to his feet, drawing back his right arm and hurling, the throwing-stick giving added velocity to the spear. Beside him, he was conscious of Analea rising and propelling her spear. His missile caught the little bearded pony in the chest; it stumbled and fell forward to its front knees. He snatched another light spear, set it on the hook of the stick and darted it at another horse, which reared, biting at the spear with its teeth. Grabbing the heavy stabbing-spear, he ran forward, finishing it off with a heart-thrust. As he did, Varnis slung her carbine, snatched a stone-headed throwing axe from her belt, and knocked down another horse, then ran forward with her dagger to finish it.  By this time, the herd, alarmed, had stampeded and was galloping away, leaving the dead and dying behind. He and Analea had each killed two; with the one Varnis had knocked down, that made five. Using his dagger, he finished off one that was still kicking on the ground, and then began pulling out the throwing-spears. The girls, shouting in unison, were announcing the successful completion of the hunt; Glav, Olva, and Dorita were coming forward with the children.         *       *       *       *       *  It was sunset by the time they had finished the work of skinning and cutting up the horses and had carried the hide-wrapped bundles of meat to the little brook where they had intended camping. There was firewood to be gathered, and the meal to be cooked, and they were all tired.  "We can't do this very often, any more," Kalvar Dard told them, "but we might as well, tonight. Don't bother rubbing sticks for fire; I'll use the lighter."  He got it from a pouch on his belt--a small, gold-plated, atomic lighter, bearing the crest of his old regiment of the Frontier Guards. It was the last one they had, in working order. Piling a handful of dry splinters under the firewood, he held the lighter to it, pressed the activator, and watched the fire eat into the wood.  The greatest achievement of man's civilization, the mastery of the basic, cosmic, power of the atom--being used to kindle a fire of natural fuel, to cook unseasoned meat killed with stone-tipped spears. Dard looked sadly at the twinkling little gadget, then slipped it back into its pouch. Soon it would be worn out, like the other two, and then they would gain fire only by rubbing dry sticks, or hacking sparks from bits of flint or pyrites. Soon, too, the last cartridge would be fired, and then they would perforce depend for protection, as they were already doing for food, upon their spears.  And they were so helpless. Six adults, burdened with seven little children, all of them requiring momently care and watchfulness. If the cartridges could be made to last until they were old enough to fend for themselves.... If they could avoid collisions with the Hairy People.... Some day, they would be numerous enough for effective mutual protection and support; some day, the ratio of helpless children to able adults would redress itself. Until then, all that they could do would be to survive; day after day, they must follow the game-herds.     4   For twenty years, now, they had been following the game. Winters had come, with driving snow, forcing horses and deer into the woods, and the little band of humans to the protection of mountain caves. Springtime followed, with fresh grass on the plains and plenty of meat for the people of Kalvar Dard. Autumns followed summers, with fire-hunts, and the smoking and curing of meat and hides. Winters followed autumns, and springtimes came again, and thus until the twentieth year after the landing of the rocket-boat.  Kalvar Dard still walked in the lead, his hair and beard flecked with gray, but he no longer carried the heavy rifle; the last cartridge for that had been fired long ago. He carried the hand-axe, fitted with a long helve, and a spear with a steel head that had been worked painfully from the receiver of a useless carbine. He still had his pistol, with eight cartridges in the magazine, and his dagger, and the bomb-bag, containing the big demolition-bomb and one grenade. The last shred of clothing from the ship was gone, now; he was clad in a sleeveless tunic of skin and horsehide buskins.  Analea no longer walked beside him; eight years before, she had broken her back in a fall. It had been impossible to move her, and she stabbed herself with her dagger to save a cartridge. Seldar Glav had broken through the ice while crossing a river, and had lost his rifle; the next day he died of the chill he had taken. Olva had been killed by the Hairy People, the night they had attacked the camp, when Varnis' child had been killed.  They had beaten off that attack, shot or speared ten of the huge sub-men, and the next morning they buried their dead after their custom, under cairns of stone. Varnis had watched the burial of her child with blank, uncomprehending eyes, then she had turned to Kalvar Dard and said something that had horrified him more than any wild outburst of grief could have.  "Come on, Dard; what are we doing this for? You promised you'd take us to Tareesh, where we'd have good houses, and machines, and all sorts of lovely things to eat and wear. I don't like this place, Dard; I want to go to Tareesh."  From that day on, she had wandered in merciful darkness. She had not been idiotic, or raving mad; she had just escaped from a reality that she could no longer bear.  Varnis, lost in her dream-world, and Dorita, hard-faced and haggard, were the only ones left, beside Kalvar Dard, of the original eight. But the band had grown, meanwhile, to more than fifteen. In the rear, in Seldar Glav's old place, the son of Kalvar Dard and Analea walked. Like his father, he wore a pistol, for which he had six rounds, and a dagger, and in his hand he carried a stone-headed killing-maul with a three-foot handle which he had made for himself. The woman who walked beside him and carried his spears was the daughter of Glav and Olva; in a net-bag on her back she carried their infant child. The first Tareeshan born of Tareeshan parents; Kalvar Dard often looked at his little grandchild during nights in camp and days on the trail, seeing, in that tiny fur-swaddled morsel of humanity, the meaning and purpose of all that he did. Of the older girls, one or two were already pregnant, now; this tiny threatened beachhead of humanity was expanding, gaining strength. Long after man had died out on Doorsha and the dying planet itself had become an arid waste, the progeny of this little band would continue to grow and to dominate the younger planet, nearer the sun. Some day, an even mightier civilization than the one he had left would rise here....         *       *       *       *       *  All day the trail had wound upward into the mountains. Great cliffs loomed above them, and little streams spumed and dashed in rocky gorges below. All day, the Hairy People had followed, fearful to approach too close, unwilling to allow their enemies to escape. It had started when they had rushed the camp, at daybreak; they had been beaten off, at cost of almost all the ammunition, and the death of one child. No sooner had the tribe of Kalvar Dard taken the trail, however, than they had been pressing after them. Dard had determined to cross the mountains, and had led his people up a game-trail, leading toward the notch of a pass high against the skyline.  The shaggy ape-things seemed to have divined his purpose. Once or twice, he had seen hairy brown shapes dodging among the rocks and stunted trees to the left. They were trying to reach the pass ahead of him. Well, if they did.... He made a quick mental survey of his resources. His pistol, and his son's, and Dorita's, with eight, and six, and seven rounds. One grenade, and the big demolition bomb, too powerful to be thrown by hand, but which could be set for delayed explosion and dropped over a cliff or left behind to explode among pursuers. Five steel daggers, and plenty of spears and slings and axes. Himself, his son and his son's woman, Dorita, and four or five of the older boys and girls, who would make effective front-line fighters. And Varnis, who might come out of her private dream-world long enough to give account for herself, and even the tiniest of the walking children could throw stones or light spears. Yes, they could force the pass, if the Hairy People reached it ahead of them, and then seal it shut with the heavy bomb. What lay on the other side, he did not know; he wondered how much game there would be, and if there were Hairy People on that side, too.  Two shots slammed quickly behind him. He dropped his axe and took a two-hand grip on his stabbing-spear as he turned. His son was hurrying forward, his pistol drawn, glancing behind as he came.  "Hairy People. Four," he reported. "I shot two; she threw a spear and killed another. The other ran."  The daughter of Seldar Glav and Olva nodded in agreement.  "I had no time to throw again," she said, "and Bo-Bo would not shoot the one that ran."  Kalvar Dard's son, who had no other name than the one his mother had called him as a child, defended himself. "He was running away. It is the rule: _use bullets only to save life, where a spear will not serve_."  Kalvar Dard nodded. "You did right, son," he said, taking out his own pistol and removing the magazine, from which he extracted two cartridges. "Load these into your pistol; four rounds aren't enough. Now we each have six. Go back to the rear, keep the little ones moving, and don't let Varnis get behind."  "That is right. _We must all look out for Varnis, and take care of her_," the boy recited obediently. "That is the rule."  He dropped to the rear. Kalvar Dard holstered his pistol and picked up his axe, and the column moved forward again. They were following a ledge, now; on the left, there was a sheer drop of several hundred feet, and on the right a cliff rose above them, growing higher and steeper as the trail slanted upward. Dard was worried about the ledge; if it came to an end, they would all be trapped. No one would escape. He suddenly felt old and unutterably weary. It was a frightful weight that he bore--responsibility for an entire race.         *       *       *       *       *  Suddenly, behind him, Dorita fired her pistol upward. Dard sprang forward--there was no room for him to jump aside--and drew his pistol. The boy, Bo-Bo, was trying to find a target from his position in the rear. Then Dard saw the two Hairy People; the boy fired, and the stone fell, all at once.  It was a heavy stone, half as big as a man's torso, and it almost missed Kalvar Dard. If it had hit him directly, it would have killed him instantly, mashing him to a bloody pulp; as it was, he was knocked flat, the stone pinning his legs.  At Bo-Bo's shot, a hairy body plummeted down, to hit the ledge. Bo-Bo's woman instantly ran it through with one of her spears. The other ape-thing, the one Dorita had shot, was still clinging to a rock above. Two of the children scampered up to it and speared it repeatedly, screaming like little furies. Dorita and one of the older girls got the rock off Kalvar Dard's legs and tried to help him to his feet, but he collapsed, unable to stand. Both his legs were broken.  This was it, he thought, sinking back. "Dorita, I want you to run ahead and see what the trail's like," he said. "See if the ledge is passable. And find a place, not too far ahead, where we can block the trail by exploding that demolition-bomb. It has to be close enough for a couple of you to carry or drag me and get me there in one piece."  "What are you going to do?"  "What do you think?" he retorted. "I have both legs broken. You can't carry me with you; if you try it, they'll catch us and kill us all. I'll have to stay behind; I'll block the trail behind you, and get as many of them as I can, while I'm at it. Now, run along and do as I said."  She nodded. "I'll be back as soon as I can," she agreed.  The others were crowding around Dard. Bo-Bo bent over him, perplexed and worried. "What are you going to do, father?" he asked. "You are hurt. Are you going to go away and leave us, as mother did when she was hurt?"  "Yes, son; I'll have to. You carry me on ahead a little, when Dorita gets back, and leave me where she shows you to. I'm going to stay behind and block the trail, and kill a few Hairy People. I'll use the big bomb."  "The _big_ bomb? The one nobody dares throw?" The boy looked at his father in wonder.  "That's right. Now, when you leave me, take the others and get away as fast as you can. Don't stop till you're up to the pass. Take my pistol and dagger, and the axe and the big spear, and take the little bomb, too. Take everything I have, only leave the big bomb with me. I'll need that."  Dorita rejoined them. "There's a waterfall ahead. We can get around it, and up to the pass. The way's clear and easy; if you put off the bomb just this side of it, you'll start a rock-slide that'll block everything."  "All right. Pick me up, a couple of you. Don't take hold of me below the knees. And hurry."         *       *       *       *       *  A hairy shape appeared on the ledge below them; one of the older boys used his throwing-stick to drive a javelin into it. Two of the girls picked up Dard; Bo-Bo and his woman gathered up the big spear and the axe and the bomb-bag.  They hurried forward, picking their way along the top of a talus of rubble at the foot of the cliff, and came to where the stream gushed out of a narrow gorge. The air was wet with spray there, and loud with the roar of the waterfall. Kalvar Dard looked around; Dorita had chosen the spot well. Not even a sure-footed mountain-goat could make the ascent, once that gorge was blocked.  "All right; put me down here," he directed. "Bo-Bo, take my belt, and give me the big bomb. You have one light grenade; know how to use it?"  "Of course, you have often showed me. I turn the top, and then press in the little thing on the side, and hold it in till I throw. I throw it at least a spear-cast, and drop to the ground or behind something."  "That's right. And use it only in greatest danger, to save everybody. Spare your cartridges; use them only to save life. And save everything of metal, no matter how small."  "Yes. Those are the rules. I will follow them, and so will the others. And we will always take care of Varnis."  "Well, goodbye, son." He gripped the boy's hand. "Now get everybody out of here; don't stop till you're at the pass."  "You're not staying behind!" Varnis cried. "Dard, you promised us! I remember, when we were all in the ship together--you and I and Analea and Olva and Dorita and Eldra and, oh, what was that other girl's name, Kyna! And we were all having such a nice time, and you were telling us how we'd all come to Tareesh, and we were having such fun talking about it...."  "That's right, Varnis," he agreed. "And so I will. I have something to do, here, but I'll meet you on top of the mountain, after I'm through, and in the morning we'll all go to Tareesh."  She smiled--the gentle, childlike smile of the harmlessly mad--and turned away. The son of Kalvar Dard made sure that she and all the children were on the way, and then he, too, turned and followed them, leaving Dard alone.  Alone, with a bomb and a task. He'd borne that task for twenty years, now; in a few minutes, it would be ended, with an instant's searing heat. He tried not to be too glad; there were so many things he might have done, if he had tried harder. Metals, for instance. Somewhere there surely must be ores which they could have smelted, but he had never found them. And he might have tried catching some of the little horses they hunted for food, to break and train to bear burdens. And the alphabet--why hadn't he taught it to Bo-Bo and the daughter of Seldar Glav, and laid on them an obligation to teach the others? And the grass-seeds they used for making flour sometimes; they should have planted fields of the better kinds, and patches of edible roots, and returned at the proper time to harvest them. There were so many things, things that none of those young savages or their children would think of in ten thousand years....  Something was moving among the rocks, a hundred yards away. He straightened, as much as his broken legs would permit, and watched. Yes, there was one of them, and there was another, and another. One rose from behind a rock and came forward at a shambling run, making bestial sounds. Then two more lumbered into sight, and in a moment the ravine was alive with them. They were almost upon him when Kalvar Dard pressed in the thumbpiece of the bomb; they were clutching at him when he released it. He felt a slight jar....         *       *       *       *       *  When they reached the pass, they all stopped as the son of Kalvar Dard turned and looked back. Dorita stood beside him, looking toward the waterfall too; she also knew what was about to happen. The others merely gaped in blank incomprehension, or grasped their weapons, thinking that the enemy was pressing close behind and that they were making a stand here. A few of the smaller boys and girls began picking up stones.  Then a tiny pin-point of brilliance winked, just below where the snow-fed stream vanished into the gorge. That was all, for an instant, and then a great fire-shot cloud swirled upward, hundreds of feet into the air; there was a crash, louder than any sound any of them except Dorita and Varnis had ever heard before.  "He did it!" Dorita said softly.  "Yes, he did it. My father was a brave man," Bo-Bo replied. "We are safe, now."  Varnis, shocked by the explosion, turned and stared at him, and then she laughed happily. "Why, there you are, Dard!" she exclaimed. "I was wondering where you'd gone. What did you do, after we left?"  "What do you mean?" The boy was puzzled, not knowing how much he looked like his father, when his father had been an officer of the Frontier Guards, twenty years before.  His puzzlement worried Varnis vaguely. "You.... You are Dard, aren't you?" she asked. "But that's silly; of course you're Dard! Who else could you be?"  "Yes. I am Dard," the boy said, remembering that it was the rule for everybody to be kind to Varnis and to pretend to agree with her. Then another thought struck him. His shoulders straightened. "Yes. I am Dard, son of Dard," he told them all. "I lead, now. Does anybody say no?"  He shifted his axe and spear to his left hand and laid his right hand on the butt of his pistol, looking sternly at Dorita. If any of them tried to dispute his claim, it would be she. But instead, she gave him the nearest thing to a real smile that had crossed her face in years.  "You are Dard," she told him; "you lead us, now."  "But of course Dard leads! Hasn't he always led us?" Varnis wanted to know. "Then what's all the argument about? And tomorrow he's going to take us to Tareesh, and we'll have houses and ground-cars and aircraft and gardens and lights, and all the lovely things we want. Aren't you, Dard?"  "Yes, Varnis; I will take you all to Tareesh, to all the wonderful things," Dard, son of Dard, promised, for such was the rule about Varnis.  Then he looked down from the pass into the country beyond. There were lower mountains, below, and foothills, and a wide blue valley, and, beyond that, distant peaks reared jaggedly against the sky. He pointed with his father's axe.  "We go down that way," he said.         *       *       *       *       *  So they went, down, and on, and on, and on. The last cartridge was fired; the last sliver of Doorshan metal wore out or rusted away. By then, however, they had learned to make chipped stone, and bone, and reindeer-horn, serve their needs. Century after century, millennium after millennium, they followed the game-herds from birth to death, and birth replenished their numbers faster than death depleted. Bands grew in numbers and split; young men rebelled against the rule of the old and took their women and children elsewhere.  They hunted down the hairy Neanderthalers, and exterminated them ruthlessly, the origin of their implacable hatred lost in legend. All that they remembered, in the misty, confused, way that one remembers a dream, was that there had once been a time of happiness and plenty, and that there was a goal to which they would some day attain. They left the mountains--were they the Caucasus? The Alps? The Pamirs?--and spread outward, conquering as they went.  We find their bones, and their stone weapons, and their crude paintings, in the caves of Cro-Magnon and Grimaldi and Altimira and Mas-d'Azil; the deep layers of horse and reindeer and mammoth bones at their feasting-place at Solutre. We wonder how and whence a race so like our own came into a world of brutish sub-humans.  Just as we wonder, too, at the network of canals which radiate from the polar caps of our sister planet, and speculate on the possibility that they were the work of hands like our own. And we concoct elaborate jokes about the "Men From Mars"--_ourselves_.   The End            *       *       *       *       *   TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS CORRECTED  The following typographical errors in the text were corrected as detailed here.  In the text: "... an automatic computer figured the distance to the planet,..." the word "computor" was corrected to "computer."  In the text: "Then, with every atom of strength they possessed they ran away ...," the word "posessed" was corrected to "possessed."  In two places in the text "Anelea" was corrected to "Analea."  In the text: "If they could avoid collisions with the Hairy People..." the word "collisons" was corrected to "collisions."  In the text: "Some day, an even mightier civilization than the one he had left would rise here ..." the word "that" was corrected to "than."  In the text: "There had been a quick flurry of shots that had felled all four of the assailants, and Seldar Glav had finished..." the word "Klav" was corrected to "Glav."Chester Pelton retracted his paunch as far as the breakfast seat would permit; the table, its advent preceded by a collection of mouth-watering aromas, slid noiselessly out of the pantry and clicked into place in front of him.  "Everything all right, Miss Claire?" a voice floated out after it from beyond. "Anything else you want?"  "Everything's just fine, Mrs. Harris," Claire replied. "I suppose Mr. Pelton'll want seconds, and Ray'll probably want thirds and fourths of everything." She waved a hand over the photocell that closed the pantry door, and slid into place across from her brother, who already had a glass of fruit juice in one hand and was lifting platter covers with the other.  "Real eggs!" the boy was announcing. "Bacon. Wheat-bread toast." He looked again. "Hey, Sis, is this real cow-made butter?"  "Yes. Now go ahead and eat."  As though Ray needed encouragement, Chester Pelton thought, watching his son use a spoon--the biggest one available--to dump gobs of honey on his toast. While he was helping himself to bacon and eggs, he could hear Ray's full-mouthed exclamation: "This is real bee-comb honey, too!" That pleased him. The boy was a true Pelton; only needed one bite to distinguish between real and synthetic food.  "Bet this breakfast didn't cost a dollar under five C," Ray continued, a little more audibly, between bites.  [Illustration:]  That was another Pelton trait; even at fifteen, the boy was learning the value of money. Claire seemed to disapprove, however.  "Oh, Ray; try not to always think of what things cost," she reproved.  "If I had all she spends on natural food, I could have a this-season's model 'copter-bike, like Jimmy Hartnett," Ray continued.  Pelton frowned. "I don't want you running around with that boy, Ray," he said, his mouth full of bacon and eggs. Under his daughter's look of disapproval, he swallowed hastily, then continued: "He's not the sort of company I want my son keeping."  "But, Senator," Ray protested. "He lives next door to us. Why, we can see Hartnett's aerial from the top of our landing stage!"  "That doesn't matter," he said, in a tone meant to indicate that the subject was not to be debated. "He's a Literate!"  "More eggs, Senator?" Claire asked, extending the platter and gesturing with the serving knife.  He chuckled inwardly. Claire always knew what to do when his temper started climbing to critical mass. He allowed her to load his plate again.  "And speaking of our landing stage, have you been up there, this morning, Ray?" he asked.  They both looked at him inquiringly.  "Delivered last evening, while you two were out," he explained. "New winter model Rolls-Cadipac." He felt a glow of paternal pleasure as Claire gave a yelp of delight and aimed a glancing kiss at the top of his bald head. Ray dropped his fork, slid from his seat, and bolted for the lift, even bacon, eggs, and real bee-comb honey forgotten.  With elaborate absent-mindedness, Chester Pelton reached for the switch to turn on the video screen over the pantry door.  "Oh-oh! Oh-oh!" Claire's slender hand went out to stop his own. "Not till coffee and cigarettes, Senator."  "It's almost oh-eight-fifteen; I want the newscast."  "Can't you just relax for a while? Honestly, Senator, you're killing yourself."  "Oh, rubbish! I've been working a little hard, but--"  "You've been working too hard. And today, with the sale at the store, and the last day of the campaign--"  "Why the devil did that idiot of a Latterman have the sale advertised for today, anyhow?" he fumed. "Doesn't he know I'm running for the Senate?"  "I doubt it," Claire said. "He may have heard of it, the way you've heard about an election in Pakistan or Abyssinia, or he just may not know there is such a thing as politics. I think he does know there's a world outside the store, but he doesn't care much what goes on in it." She pushed her plate aside, poured a cup of coffee, and levered a cigarette from the Readilit, puffing at it with the relish of the morning's first smoke. "All he knows is that we're holding our sale three days ahead of Macy & Gimbel's."  "Russ is a good businessman," Pelton said seriously. "I wish you'd take a little more interest in him, Claire."  "If you mean what I think you do, no thanks," Claire replied. "I suppose I'll get married, some day--most girls do--but it'll be to somebody who can hang his business up at the office before he comes home. Russ Latterman is so married to the store that if he married me too, it'd be bigamy. Ready for your coffee?" Without waiting for an answer, she filled his cup and ejected a lighted cigarette from the box for him, then snapped on the video screen.  It lit at once, and a nondescriptly handsome young man was grinning toothily out of it. He wore a white smock, halfway to his knees, and, over it, an old-fashioned Sam Browne belt which supported a bulky leather-covered tablet and a large stylus. On the strap which crossed his breast five or six little metal badges twinkled.  "... Why no other beer can compare with delicious, tangy, Cardon's Black Bottle. Won't you try it?" he pleaded. "Then you will see for yourself why millions of happy drinkers always Call For Cardon's. And now, that other favorite of millions, Literate First Class Elliot C. Mongery."  Pelton muttered: "Why Frank sponsors that blabbermouth of a Mongery--"  Ray, sliding back onto the bench, returned to his food.  "Jimmy's book had pictures," he complained, forking up another mixture of eggs, bacon, toast and honey.  "Book?" Claire echoed. "Oh, the instructions for the 'copter?"  "Pipe down, both of you!" Pelton commanded. "The newscast--"  Literate First Class Elliot C. Mongery, revealed by a quick left quarter-turn of the pickup camera, wore the same starchy white smock, the same Sam Browne belt glittering with the badges of the organizations and corporations for whom he was authorized to practice Literacy. The tablet on his belt, Pelton knew, was really a camouflaged holster for a small automatic, and the gold stylus was a gas-projector. The black-leather-jacketed bodyguards, of course, were discreetly out of range of the camera. Members of the Associated Fraternities of Literates weren't exactly loved by the non-reading public they claimed to serve. The sight of one of those starchy, perpetually-spotless, white smocks always affected Pelton like a red cape to a bull. He snorted in disdain. The raised eyebrow toward the announcer on the left, the quick, perennially boyish smile, followed by the levelly serious gaze into the camera--the whole act might have been a film-transcription of Mongery's first appearance on the video, fifteen years ago. At least, it was off the same ear of corn.  "That big hunk of cheese," Ray commented. For once, Pelton didn't shush him; that was too close to his own attitude, at least in family-breakfast-table terminology.  "... First of all; for the country, and especially the Newer New York area, and by the way, it looks as though somebody thought somebody needed a little cooling off, but we'll come to that later. Here's the forecast: Today and tomorrow, the weather will continue fine; warm in the sun, chilly in the shadows. There won't be anything to keep you from the polls, tomorrow, except bird-hunting, or a last chance at a game of golf. This is the first time within this commentator's memory that the weather has definitely been in favor of the party out of power.  "On the world scene: You'll be glad to hear that the survivors of the wrecked strato-rocket have all been rescued from the top of Mount Everest, after a difficult and heroic effort by the Royal Nepalese Air Force.... The results of last week's election in Russia are being challenged by twelve of the fourteen parties represented on the ballot; the only parties not hurling accusations of fraud are the Democrats, who won, and the Christian Communists, who are about as influential in Russian politics as the Vegetarian-Anti-Vaccination Party is here.... The Central Diplomatic Council of the Reunited Nations has just announced, for the hundred and seventy-eighth time, that the Arab-Israel dispute has been finally, definitely and satisfactorily settled. This morning's reports from Baghdad and Tel Aviv only list four Arabs and six Israelis killed in border clashes in the past twenty-four hours, so maybe they're really getting things patched up, after all. During the same period, there were more fatalities in Newer New York as a result of clashes between the private troops of rival racket gangs, political parties and business houses.  "Which brings us to the local scene. On my way to the studio this morning, I stopped at City Hall, and found our genial Chief of Police Delaney, 'Irish' Delaney to most of us, hard at work with a portable disintegrator, getting rid of record disks and recording tapes of old and long-settled cases. He had a couple of amusing stories. For instance, a lone Independent-Conservative partisan broke up a Radical-Socialist mass meeting preparatory to a march to demonstrate in Double Times Square, by applying his pocket lighter to one of the heat-sensitive boxes in the building and activating the sprinkler system. By the time the Radicals had gotten into dry clothing, there was a, well, sort of, impromptu Conservative demonstration going on in Double Times Square, and one of the few things the local gendarmes won't stand for is an attempt to hold two rival political meetings in the same area.  "Curiously, while it was the Radicals who got soaked, it was the Conservatives who sneezed," Mongery went on, his face glowing with mischievous amusement. "It seems that while they were holding a monster rally at Hague Hall, in North Jersey Borough, some person or persons unknown got at the air-conditioning system with a tank of sneeze gas, which didn't exactly improve either the speaking style of Senator Grant Hamilton or the attentiveness of his audience. Needless to say, there is no police investigation of either incident. Election shenanigans, like college pranks, are fair play as long as they don't cause an outright holocaust. And that, I think, is as it should be," Mongery went on, more seriously. "Most of the horrors of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries were the result of taking politics too seriously."  Pelton snorted again. That was the Literate line, all right; treat politics as a joke and an election as a sporting event, let the Independent-Conservative grafters stay in power, and let the Literates run the country through them. Not, of course, that he disapproved of those boys in the Young Radical League who'd thought up that sneeze-gas trick.  "And now, what you've been waiting for," Mongery continued. "The final Trotter Poll's pre-election analysis." A novice Literate advanced, handing him a big loose-leaf book, which he opened with the reverence a Literate always displayed toward the written word. "This," he said, "is going to surprise you. For the whole state of Penn-Jersey-York, the poll shows a probable Radical-Socialist vote of approximately thirty million, an Independent-Conservative vote of approximately ten and a half million, and a vote of about a million for what we call the Who-Gives-A-Damn Party, which, frankly, is the party of your commentator's choice. Very few sections differ widely from this average--there will be a much heavier Radical vote in the Pittsburgh area, and traditionally Conservative Philadelphia and the upper Hudson Valley will give the Radicals a much smaller majority."  They all looked at one another, thunderstruck.  "If Mongery's admitting that, I'm in!" Pelton exclaimed.  "Yeah, we can start calling him Senator, now, and really mean it," Ray said. "Maybe old Mongie isn't such a bad sort of twerp, after all."  "Considering that the Conservatives carried this state by a substantial majority in the presidential election of two years ago, and by a huge majority in the previous presidential election of 2136," Mongery, in the screen, continued, "this verdict of the almost infallible Trotter Poll needs some explaining. For the most part, it is the result of the untiring efforts of one man, the dynamic new leader of the Radical-Socialists and their present candidate for the Consolidated States of North America Senate, Chester Pelton, who has transformed that once-moribund party into the vital force it is today. And this achievement has been due, very largely, to a single slogan which he had hammered into your ears: _Put the Literates in their place; our servants, not our masters!_" He brushed a hand deprecatingly over his white smock and fingered the badges on his belt.  "There has always been, on the part of the Illiterate public, some resentment against organized Literacy. In part, it has been due to the high fees charged for Literate services, and to what seems, to many, to be monopolistic practices. But behind that is a general attitude of anti-intellectualism which is our heritage from the disastrous wars of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries. Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman of this attitude. In his view, it was men who could read and write who hatched the diabolical political ideologies and designed the frightful nuclear weapons of that period. In his mind, Literacy is equated with '_Mein Kampf_' and '_Das Kapital_', with the A-bomb and the H-bomb, with concentration camps and blasted cities. From this position, of course, I beg politely to differ. Literate men also gave us the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence.  "Now, in spite of a lunatic fringe in the Consolidated Illiterates' Organization who want just that, Chester Pelton knows that we cannot abolish Literacy entirely. Even with modern audio-visual recording, need exists for some modicum of written recording, which can be rapidly scanned and selected from--indexing, cataloguing, tabulating data, et cetera--and for at least a few men and women who can form and interpret the written word. Mr. Pelton, himself, is the owner of a huge department store, employing over a thousand Illiterates; he must at all times have the services of at least fifty Literates."  "And pays through the nose for them, too!" Pelton growled. It was more than fifty; and Russ Latterman had been forced to get twenty extras sent in for the sale.  "Now, since we cannot renounce Literacy entirely, without sinking to _fellahin_ barbarism, and here I definitely part company with Mr. Pelton, he fears the potential power of organized Literacy. In a word, he fears a future Literate Dictatorship."  "Future? What do you think we have now?" Pelton demanded.  "Nobody," Mongery said, as though replying to him, "is stupid enough, today, to want to be a dictator. That ended by the middle of the Twenty-first Century. Everybody knows what happened to Mussolini, and Hitler, and Stalin, and all their imitators. Why, it is as much the public fear of Big Government as the breakdown of civil power because of the administrative handicap of a shortage of Literate administrators that is responsible for the disgraceful lawlessness of the past hundred years. Thus, it speaks well for the public trust in Chester Pelton's known integrity and sincerity that so many of our people are willing to agree to his program for socialized Literacy. They feel that he can be trusted, and, violently as I disagree with him, I can only say that that trust is not misplaced.  "Of course, there is also the question, so often raised by Mr. Pelton, that under the Hamilton machine, the politics, and particularly the enforcement of the laws, in this state, are unbelievably corrupt, but I wonder--"  Mongery paused. "Just a moment; I see a flash bulletin being brought in." The novice Literate came to his side and gave him a slip of paper, at which he glanced. Then he laughed heartily.  "It seems that shortly after I began speaking, the local blue-ribbon grand jury issued a summons for Chief Delaney to appear before them, with all his records. Unfortunately, the summons could not be served; Chief Delaney had just boarded a strato-rocket from Tom Dewey Field for Buenos Aires." He cocked an eye at the audience. "I know Irish is going to have a nice time, down there in the springtime of the Southern Hemisphere. And, incidentally, the Argentine is one of the few major powers which never signed the World Extradition Convention of 2087." He raised his hand to his audience. "And now, until tomorrow at breakfast, sincerely yours for Cardon's Black Bottle, Elliot C. Mongery."  "Well, whattaya know; that guy was plugging for you!" Ray said. "And see how he managed to slide in that bit about corruption, right before his stooge handed him that bulletin?"  "I guess every Literate has his price," Chester Pelton said. "I wonder how much of my money that cost. I always wondered why Frank Cardon sponsored Mongery. Now I know. Mongery can be had."  "Uh, beg your pardon, Mr. Pelton," a voice from the hall broke in.  He turned. Olaf Olafsson, the 'copter driver, was standing at the entrance to the breakfast nook, a smudge of oil on his cheek and his straw-colored hair in disorder. "How do I go about startin' this new 'copter?"  "What?" Olaf had been his driver for ten years. He would have been less surprised had the ceiling fallen in. "You don't know how to start it?"  "No, sir. The controls is all different from on the summer model. Every time I try to raise it, it backs up; if I try to raise it much more, we won't have no wall left on the landing stage."  "Well, isn't there a book?"  "There ain't no pictures in it; nothing but print. It's a Literate book," Olaf said in disgust, as though at something obscene. "An' there ain't nothin' on the instrument board but letters."  "That's right," Ray agreed. "I saw the book; no pictures in it at all."  "Well, of all the quarter-witted stupidity! The confounded imbeciles at that agency--"  Pelton started to his feet. Claire unlocked the table and slid it out of his way. Ray, on a run, started for the lift and vanished.  "I think some confounded Literate at the Rolls-Cadipac agency did that," he fumed. "Thought it would be a joke to send me a Literate instruction book along with a 'copter with a Literate instrument board. Ah, I get it! So I'd have to call in a Literate to show me how to start my own 'copter, and by noon they'd be laughing about it in every bar from Pittsburgh to Plattsburg. Sneaky Literate trick!" They went to the lift, and found the door closed in their faces. "Oh, confound that boy!"  Claire pressed the button. Ray must have left the lift, for the operating light went on, and in a moment the door opened. He crowded into the lift, along with his daughter and Olaf.  On the landing stage, Ray was already in the 'copter, poking at buttons on the board.  "Look, Olaf!" he called. "They just shifted them around a little from the summer model. This one, where the prop-control used to be on the old model, is the one that backs it up on the ground. Here's the one that erects and extends the prop,"--he pushed it, and the prop snapped obediently into place--"and here's the one that controls the lift."  An ugly suspicion stabbed at Chester Pelton, bringing with it a feeling of frightened horror.  "How do you know?" he demanded.  Ray's eyes remained on the instrument board. He pushed another button, and the propeller began swinging in a lazy circle; he pressed down with his right foot, and the 'copter lifted a foot or so.  "What?" he asked. "Oh, Jimmy showed me how theirs works. Mr. Hartnett got one like it a week ago." He motioned to Olaf, setting the 'copter down again. "Come here; I'll show you."  The suspicion, and the horror passed in a wave of relief.  "You think you and Olaf, between you, can get that thing to school?" he asked.  "Sure! Easy!"  "All right. You show Olaf how to run it. Olaf, as soon as you've dropped Ray at school, take that thing to the Rolls-Cadipac agency, and get a new one, with a proper instrument board, and a proper picture book of operating instructions. I'm going to call Sam Huschack up personally and give him royal hell about this. Sure you can handle it, now?"  He watched the 'copter rise to the two thousand foot local traffic level and turn in the direction of Mineola High School, fifty miles away. He was still looking anxiously after it as it dwindled to a tiny dot and vanished.  "They'll make it all right," Claire told him. "Olaf has a strong back, and Ray has a good head."  "It wasn't that that I was worried about." He turned and looked, half ashamed, at his daughter. "You know, for a minute, there, I thought ... I thought Ray could read!"  "Father!" She was so shocked that she forgot the nickname they had given him when he had announced his candidacy for Senate, in the spring. "You didn't!"  "I know; it's an awful thing to think, but--Well, the kids today do the craziest things. There's that Hartnett boy he runs around with; Tom Hartnett bought Literate training for him. And that fellow Prestonby; I don't trust him--"  "Prestonby?" Claire asked, puzzled.  "Oh, you know. The principal at school. You've met him."  Claire wrinkled her brow--just like her mother, when she was trying to remember something.  "Oh, yes. I met him at that P.T.A. meeting. He didn't impress me as being much like a teacher, but I suppose they think anything's good enough for us Illiterates."         *       *       *       *       *  Literate First Class Ralph N. Prestonby remained standing by the lectern, looking out over the crowded auditorium, still pleasantly surprised to estimate the day's attendance at something like ninety-seven per cent of enrollment. That was really good; why, it was only three per cent short of perfect! Maybe it was the new rule requiring a sound-recorded excuse for absence. Or it could have been his propaganda campaign about the benefits of education. Or, very easily, it could have been the result of sending Doug Yetsko and some of his boys around to talk to recalcitrant parents. It was good to see that that was having some effect beside an increase in the number of attempts on his life, or the flood of complaints to the Board of Education. Well, Lancedale had gotten Education merged with his Office of Communications, and Lancedale was back of him to the limit, so the complaints had died out on the empty air. And Doug Yetsko was his bodyguard, so most of the would-be assassins had died, also.  The "North American Anthem," which had replaced the "Star-Spangled Banner" after the United States-Canadian-Mexican merger, came to an end. The students and their white-smocked teachers, below, relaxed from attention; most of them sat down, while monitors and teachers in the rear were getting the students into the aisles and marching them off to study halls and classrooms and workshops. The orchestra struck up a lively march tune. He leaned his left elbow--Literates learned early, or did not live to learn, not to immobilize the right hand--on the lectern and watched the interminable business of getting the students marched out, yearning, as he always did at this time, for the privacy of his office, where he could smoke his pipe. Finally, they were all gone, and the orchestra had gathered up its instruments and filed out into the wings of the stage, and he looked up to the left and said, softly:  "All right, Doug; show's over."  With a soft thud, the big man dropped down from the guard's cubicle overhead, grinning cheerfully. He needed a shave--Yetsko always did, in the mornings--and in his leather Literates' guard uniform, he looked like some ogreish giant out of the mythology of the past.  [Illustration:]  "I was glad to have you up there with the Big Noise, this morning," Prestonby said. "What a mob! I'm still trying to figure out why we have such an attendance."  "Don't you get it, captain?" Yetsko was reaching up to lock the door of his cubicle; he seemed surprised at Prestonby's obtuseness. "Day before election; the little darlings' moms and pops don't want them out running around. We can look for another big crowd tomorrow, too."  Prestonby gave a snort of disgust. "Of course; how imbecilic can I really get? I didn't notice any of them falling down, so I suppose you didn't see anything out of line."  "Well, the hall monitors make them turn in their little playthings at the doors," Yetsko said, "but hall monitors can be gotten at, and some of the stuff they make in Manual Training, when nobody's watching them--"  Prestonby nodded. Just a week before, a crude but perfectly operative 17-mm shotgun had been discovered in the last stages of manufacture in the machine shop, and five out of six of the worn-out files would vanish, to be ground down into dirks. He often thought of the stories of his grandfather, who had been a major during the Occupation of Russia, after the Fourth World War. Those old-timers didn't know how easy they'd had it; they should have tried to run an Illiterate high school.  Yetsko was still grumbling slanders on the legitimacy of the student body. "One of those little angels shoots me, it's just a cute little prank, and we oughtn't to frown on the little darling when it's just trying to express its dear little personality, or we might give it complexes, or something," he falsettoed incongruously. "And if the little darling's mistake doesn't kill me outright and I shoot back, people talk about King Herod!" He used language about the Board of Education and the tax-paying public that was probably subversive within the meaning of the Loyalty Oath. "I wish I had a pair of 40-mm auto-cannons up there, instead of that sono gun."  "Each class is a little worse than the one before; in about five years, they'll be making H-bombs in the lab," Prestonby said. In the last week, a dozen pupils had been seriously cut or blackjacked in hall and locker-room fights. "Nice citizens of the future; nice future to look forward to growing old in."  "We won't," Yetsko comforted him. "We can't be lucky all the time; in about a year, they'll find both of us stuffed into a broom closet, when they start looking around to see what's making all the stink."         *       *       *       *       *  Prestonby took the thick-barreled gas pistol from the shelf under the lectern and shoved it into his hip pocket; Yetsko picked up a two-and-a-half foot length of rubber hose and tucked it under his left arm. Together, they went back through the wings and out into the hallway that led to the office. So a Twenty-second Century high school was a place where a teacher carried a pistol and a tear-gas projector and a sleep-gas gun, and had a bodyguard, and still walked in danger of his life from armed 'teen-age hooligans. It was meaningless to ask whose fault it was. There had been the World Wars, and the cold-war interbellum periods--rising birth rates, huge demands on the public treasury for armaments, with the public taxed to the saturation point, and no money left for the schools. There had been fantastic "Progressive" education experiments--even in the 'Fifties of the Twentieth Century, in the big cities, children were being pushed through grade school without having learned to read. And when there had been money available for education, school boards had insisted on spending it for audio-visual equipment, recordings, films, anything but textbooks. And there had been that lunatic theory that children should be taught to read by recognizing whole words instead of learning the alphabet. And more and more illiterates had been shoved out of the schools, into a world where radio and television and moving pictures were supplanting books and newspapers, and more and more children of illiterates had gone to school without any desire or incentive to learn to read. And finally, the illiterates had become Illiterates, and literacy had become Literacy.  And now, the Associated Fraternities of Literates had come to monopolize the ability to read and write, and a few men like William R. Lancedale, with a handful of followers like Ralph N. Prestonby, were trying--  The gleaming cleanliness of the corridor, as always, heartened Prestonby a little; it was a trophy of victory from his first two days at Mineola High School, three years ago. He remembered what they had looked like when he had first seen them.  "This school is a pig pen!" he had barked at the janitorial force. "And even if they are Illiterates, these children aren't pigs; they deserve decent surroundings. This school will be cleaned, immediately, from top to bottom, and it'll be kept that way."  The janitors, all political appointees, Independent-Conservative party-hacks, secure in their jobs, had laughed derisively. The building superintendent, without troubling to rise, had answered him:  "Young man, you don't want to get off on the wrong foot, here," he had said. "This here's the way this school's always been run, an' it's gonna take a lot more than you to change it."  The fellow's name, he recalled, was Kettner; Lancedale had given him a briefing which had included some particulars about him. He was an Independent-Conservative ward-committeeman. He had gotten his present job after being fired from his former position as mailman for listening to other peoples' mail with his pocket recorder-reproducer.  "Yetsko," he had said. "Kick this bum out on his face."  "You can't get away with--" Kettner had begun. Yetsko had yanked him out of his chair with one hand and started for the door with him.  "Just a moment, Yetsko," he had said.  Thinking that he was backing down, they had all begun grinning at him.  "Don't bother opening the door," he had said. "Just kick him out."  After the third kick, Kettner had gotten the door open, himself; the fourth kick sent him across the hall to the opposite wall. He pulled himself to his feet and limped away, never to return. The next morning, the school was spotless. It had stayed that way.  Beside him, Yetsko must also have returned mentally to the past.  "Looks better now than it did when we first saw it, captain," he said.  "Yes. It didn't take us as long to clean up this mess as it did to clean up that mutinous guards company in Pittsburgh. But when we cleaned that up, it stayed cleaned. This is like trying to bail out a boat with a pitchfork."  "Yeah. I wish we'dda stayed in Pittsburgh, captain. I wish we'd never seen this place!"  "So do I!" Prestonby agreed, heartily.  No, he didn't, either. If he'd never have come to Mineola High School, he'd never have found Claire Pelton.         *       *       *       *       *  Sitting down again at the breakfast table with her father, Claire levered another cigarette out of the Readilit and puffed at it with exaggeratedly bored slowness. She was still frightened. Ray shouldn't have done what he did, even if he had furnished a plausible explanation. The trouble with plausible explanations was having to make them. Sooner or later, you made too many, and then you made one that wasn't so plausible, and then all the others were remembered, and they all looked phony. And why had the Senator had to mention Ralph? Was he beginning to suspect the truth about that, too?  I hope not! she thought desperately. If he ever found out about that, it'd kill him. Just kill him, period!  Mrs. Harris must have turned off the video, after they had gone up to the landing stage. To cover her nervousness, she reached up and snapped it on again. The screen lit, and from it a young man with dark eyes under bushy black brows was shouting angrily:  "... Most obvious sort of conspiracy! If the Radical-Socialist Party leaders, or the Consolidated Illiterates' Organization Political Action Committee, need any further evidence of the character of their candidate and idolized leader, Chester Pelton, the treatment given to Pelton's candidacy by Literate First Class Elliot C. Mongery, this morning, ought to be sufficient to remove the scales from the eyes of the blindest of them. I won't state, in so many words, that Chester Pelton's sold out the Radical-Socialists and the Consolidated Illiterates' Organization to the Associated Fraternities of Literates, because, since no witness to any actual transfer of money can be found, such a statement would be libelous--provided Pelton had nerve enough to sue me."  "Why, you dirty misbegotten illegitimate--!" Pelton was on his feet. His hand went to his hip, and then, realizing that he was unarmed and, in any case, confronted only by an electronic image, he sat down again.  "Pelton's been yapping for socialized Literacy," the man on the screen continued. "I'm not going back to the old argument that any kind of socialization is only the thin edge of the wedge which will pry open the pit of horrors from which the world has climbed since the Fourth World War. If you don't realize that now, it's no use for me to repeat it again. But I will ask you, do you realize, for a moment, what a program of socialized Literacy would mean, apart from the implications of any kind of socialization? It would mean that inside of five years, the Literates would control the whole government. They control the courts, now--only a Literate can become a lawyer, and only a lawyer can become a judge. They control the armed forces--only a Literate can enter West Point or Fort MacKenzie or Chapultepec or White Sands or Annapolis. And, if Chester Pelton's socialization scheme goes into effect, there will be no branch of the government which will not be completely under the control of the Associated Fraternities of Literates!"  The screen went suddenly dark. Her father turned, to catch her with her hand still on the switch.  "Put it back on; I want to hear what that lying pimp of a Slade Gardner's saying about me!"  "Phooy; you'd have shot it out, yourself, if you'd had your gun on. I saw you reaching for it. Now be quiet, and take it easy," she ordered.  He reached toward the Readilit for a cigarette, then his hand stopped. His face was contorted with pain; he gave a gasp of suffocation.  Claire cried in dismay: "You're not going to have another of those attacks? Where are the nitrocaine bulbs?"  "Don't ... have any ... here. Some at the office, but--"  "I told you to get more," she accused.  "Oh, I don't need them, really." His voice was steadier, now; the spasm of pain had passed. He filled his coffee cup and sipped from it. "Turn on the video again, Claire. I want to hear what that Gardner's saying."  "I will not! Don't you have people at party headquarters monitoring this stuff? Well, then. Somebody'll prepare an answer, if he needs answering."  "I think he does. A lot of these dumbos'll hear that and believe it. I'll talk to Frank. He'll know what to do."  Frank again. She frowned.  "Look, Senator; you think Frank Cardon's your friend, but I don't trust him. I never could," she said. "I think he's utterly and entirely unscrupulous. Amoral, I believe, is the word. Like a savage, or a pirate, or one of the old-time Nazis or Communists."  "Oh, Claire!" her father protested. "Frank's in a tough business--you have no idea the lengths competition goes to in the beer business--and he's been in politics, and dealing with racketeers and labor unions, all his life. But he's a good sound Illiterate--family Illiterate for four generations, like ours--and I'd trust him with anything. You heard this fellow Mongery--I always have to pause to keep from calling him Mongrel--saying that I deserved the credit for pulling the Radicals out of the mud and getting the party back on the tracks. Well, I couldn't have begun to do it without Frank Cardon."         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Cardon stood on the sidewalk, looking approvingly into the window of O'Reilly's Tavern, in which his display crew had already set up the spread for the current week. On either side was a giant six-foot replica, in black glass, of the Cardon bottle, in the conventional shape accepted by an Illiterate public as containing beer, bearing the red Cardon label with its pictured bottle in a central white disk. Because of the heroic size of the bottles, the pictured bottle on the label bore a bottle bearing a label bearing a bottle bearing a bottle on a label.... He counted eight pictured bottles, down to the tiniest dot of black. There were four-foot bottles next to the six-foot bottles, and three-foot bottles next to them, and, in the middle background, a life-size tri-dimensional picture of an almost nude and incredibly pulchritudinous young lady smiling in invitation at the passing throng and extending a foaming bottle of Cardon's in her hand. Aside from the printed trademark-registry statements on the labels, there was not a printed word visible in the window.  He pushed through the swinging doors and looked down the long room, with the chairs still roosting sleepily on the tables, and made a quick count of the early drinkers, two thirds of them in white smocks and Sam Browne belts, obviously from Literates' Hall, across the street. Late drinkers, he corrected himself mentally; they'd be the night shift, having their drinks before going home.  "Good morning, Mr. Cardon," the bartender greeted him. "Still drinking your own?"  "Hasn't poisoned me yet," Cardon told him. "Or anybody else." He folded a C-bill accordion-wise and set it on edge on the bar. "Give everybody what they want."  "Drink up, gentlemen, and have one on Mr. Cardon," the bartender announced, then lowered his voice. "O'Reilly wants to see you. About--" He gave a barely perceptible nod in the direction of the building across the street.  "Yes; I want to see him, too." Cardon poured from the bottle in front of him, accepted the thanks of the house, and, when the bartender brought the fifteen-dollars-odd change from the dozen drinks, he pushed it back.  He drank slowly, looking around the room, then set down his empty glass and went back, past two doors which bore pictured half-doors revealing, respectively, masculine-trousered and feminine-stockinged ankles, and opened the unmarked office door beyond. The bartender, he knew, had pushed the signal button; the door was unlocked, and, inside, O'Reilly--baptismal name Luigi Orelli--was waiting.  "Chief wants to see you, right away," the saloon keeper said.  The brewer nodded. "All right. Keep me covered; don't know how long I'll be." He crossed the room and opened a corner-cupboard, stepping inside.  The corner cupboard, which was an elevator, took him to a tunnel below the street. Across the street, he entered another elevator, set the indicator for the tenth floor, and ascended. As the car rose, he could feel the personality of Frank Cardon, Illiterate brewer, drop from him, as though he were an actor returning from the stage to his dressing room.  The room into which he emerged was almost that. There was a long table, at which two white-smocked Literates drank coffee and went over some papers; a third Literate sprawled in a deep chair, resting; at a small table, four men in black shirts and leather breeches and field boots played poker, while a fifth, who had just entered and had not yet removed his leather helmet and jacket or his weapons belt, stood watching them.  Cardon went to a row of lockers along the wall, opened one, and took out a white smock, pulling it over his head and zipping it up to the throat. Then he buckled on a Sam Browne with its tablet holster and stylus gas projector. The Literate sprawling in the chair opened one eye.  "Hi, Frank. Feels good to have them on again, doesn't it?"  "Yes. Clean," Cardon replied. "It'll be just for half an hour, but--"  He passed through the door across from the elevator, went down a short hall, and spoke in greeting to the leather-jacketed storm trooper on guard outside the door at the other end.  "Mr. Cardon," the guard nodded. "Mr. Lancedale's expecting you."  "So I understand, Bert."  He opened the door and went through. William R. Lancedale rose from behind his desk and advanced to greet him with a quick handshake, guiding him to a chair beside the desk. As he did, he sniffed and raised an eyebrow.  "Beer this early, Frank?" he asked.  "Morning, noon, and night, chief," Cardon replied. "When you said this job was going to be dangerous, I didn't know you meant that it would lead straight to an alcoholic's grave."  "Let me get you a cup of coffee, and a cigar, then." The white-haired Literate executive resumed his seat, passing a hand back and forth slowly across the face of the commo, the diamond on his finger twinkling, and gave brief instructions. "And just relax, for a minute. You have a tough job, this time, Frank."  They were both silent as a novice Literate bustled in with coffee and individually-sealed cigars.  "At least, you're not one of these plain-living-and-right-thinking fanatics, like Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves," Cardon said. "On top of everything else, that I could not take."  Lancedale's thin face broke into a smile, little wrinkles putting his mouth in parentheses. Cardon sampled the coffee, and then used a Sixteenth Century Italian stiletto from Lancedale's desk to perforate the end of his cigar.  "Much as I hate it, I'll have to get out of here as soon as I can," he said. "I don't know how long O'Reilly can keep me covered, down at the tavern--"  Lancedale nodded. "Well, how are things going, then?"  "First of all, the brewery," Cardon began.  Lancedale consigned the brewery to perdition. "That's just your cover; any money it makes is purely irrelevant. How about the election?"  "Pelton's in," Cardon said. "As nearly in as any candidate ever was before the polls opened. Three months ago, the Independents were as solid as Gibraltar used to be. Today, they look like Gibraltar after that H-bomb hit it. The only difference is, they don't know what hit them, yet."  "Hamilton's campaign manager does," Lancedale said. "Did you hear his telecast, this morning?"  Cardon shook his head. Lancedale handed over a little half-inch, thirty-minute, record disk.  "All you need is the first three or four minutes," he said. "The rest of it is repetition."  Cardon put the disk in his pocket recorder and set it for play-back, putting the plug in his ear. After a while, he shut it off and took out the ear plug.  "That's bad! What are we going to do about it?"  Lancedale shrugged. "What are you going to do?" he countered. "You're Pelton's campaign manager--Heaven pity him."  Cardon thought for a moment. "We'll play it for laughs," he decided. "Some of our semantics experts could make the joke of the year out of it by the time the polls open tomorrow. The Fraternities bribing their worst enemy to attack them, so that he can ruin their business; who's been listening to a tape of 'Alice in Wonderland' at Independent-Conservative headquarters?"  "That would work," Lancedale agreed. "And we can count on our friends Joyner and Graves to give you every possible assistance with their customary bull-in-a-china-shop tactics. I suppose you've seen these posters they've been plastering around: _If you can read this, Chester Pelton is your sworn enemy! A vote for Pelton is a vote for your own enslavement!_"  "Naturally. And have you seen the telecast we've been using--a view of it, with a semantically correct spoken paraphrase?"  Lancedale nodded. "And I've also noticed that those posters have been acquiring different obscene crayon-drawings, too. That's just typical of the short-range Joyner-Graves mentality. Why, they've made more votes for Pelton than he's made for himself. Is it any wonder we're convinced that people like that aren't to be trusted to formulate the future policy of the Fraternities?"  "Well ... they've proved themselves wrong. I wonder, though, if we can prove ourselves right, in the long run. There are times when this thing scares me, chief. If anything went wrong--"  "What, for instance?"  "Somebody could get to Pelton." Cardon made a stabbing gesture with the stiletto, which he still held. "Maybe you don't really know how hot this thing's gotten. What we had to cut out of Mongery's report, this morning--"  "Oh, I've been keeping in touch," Lancedale understated gently.  "Well then. If anything happened to Pelton, there wouldn't be a Literate left alive in this city twelve hours later. And I question whether or not Graves and Joyner know that."  "I think they do. If they don't, it's not because I've failed to point it out to them. Of course, there are the Independent-Conservative grafters; a lot of them are beginning to hear jail doors opening for them, and they're scared. But I think routine body-guarding ought to protect Pelton from them, or from any isolated fanatics."  "And there is also the matter of Pelton's daughter, and his son," Cardon said. "We know, and Graves and Joyner know, and I assume that Slade Gardner knows, that they can both read and write as well as any Literate in the Fraternities. Suppose that got out between now and the election?"  "And that could not only hurt Pelton, but it would expose the work we've been doing in the schools," Lancedale added. "And even inside the Fraternities, that would raise the devil. Joyner and Graves don't begin to realize how far we've gone with that. They could kick up a simply hideous row about it!"  "And if Pelton found out that his kids are Literates--_Woooo!_" Cardon grimaced. "Or what we've been doing to him. I hope I'm not around when that happens. I'm beginning to like the cantankerous old bugger."  "I was afraid of that," Lancedale said. "Well, don't let it interfere with what you have to do. Remember, Frank; the Plan has to come first, always."  He walked with O'Reilly to the street door, talking about tomorrow's election; after shaking hands with the saloon keeper, he crossed the sidewalk and stepped onto the beltway, moving across the strips until he came to the twenty m.p.h. strip. The tall office buildings of upper Yonkers Borough marched away as he stood on the strip, appreciatively puffing at Lancedale's cigar. The character of the street changed; the buildings grew lower, and the quiet and fashionable ground-floor shops and cafes gave place to bargain stores, their audio-advertisers whooping urgently about improbable prices and offerings, and garish, noisy, crowded bars and cafeterias blaring recorded popular music. There was quite a bit of political advertising in evidence--huge pictures of the two major senatorial candidates. He estimated that Chester Pelton's bald head and bulldog features appeared twice for every one of Grant Hamilton's white locks, old-fashioned spectacles and self-satisfied smirk.  Then he came to the building on which he had parked his 'copter, and left the beltway, entering and riding up to the landing stage on the helical escalator. There seemed to have been some trouble; about a dozen Independent-Conservative storm troopers, in their white robes and hoods, with the fiery-cross emblem on their breasts, were bunched together, most of them with their right hands inside their bosoms, while a similar group of Radical-Conservative storm troopers, with their black sombreros and little black masks, stood watching them and fingering the white-handled pistols they wore in pairs on their belts. Between the two groups were four city policemen, looking acutely unhappy.  The group in the Lone Ranger uniforms, he saw, were standing in front of a huge tri-dimensional animated portrait of Chester Pelton. As he watched, the pictured candidate raised a clenched fist, and Pelton's recorded and amplified voice thundered:  "_Put the Literates in their place! Our servants, not our masters!_"  He recognized the group leader of the Radical-Socialists--the masks were too small to be more than token disguises--and beckoned to him, at the same time walking toward his 'copter. The man in black with the white-handled pistols followed him, spurs jingling.  "Hello, Mr. Cardon," he said, joining him. "Nothing to it. We got a tip they were coming to sabotage Big Brother, over there. Take out our sound-recording, and put in one of their own, like they did over in Queens, last week. The town clowns got here in time to save everybody's face, so there wasn't any shooting. We're staying put till they go, though."  "_Put the Literates in their place! Our servants, not our masters!_" the huge tridianimate bellowed.  Over in Queens, the Independents had managed to get at a similar tridianimate, had taken out the record, and had put in one: _I am a lying fraud! Vote for Grant Hamilton and liberty and sound government!_  "Smart work, Goodkin," he approved. "Don't let any of your boys start the gunplay. The city cops are beginning to get wise to who's going to win the election, tomorrow, but don't antagonize them. But if any of those Ku Kluxers tries to pull a gun, don't waste time trying to wing him. Just hold on to that fiery something-or-other on his chest and let him have it, and let the coroner worry about him."  "Yeah. With pleasure," Goodkin replied. "You know, that nightshirt thing they wear is about the stupidest idea for a storm-troop uniform I ever saw. Natural target in a gunfight, and in a rough-and-tumble it gets them all tangled up. Ah, there go a couple of coppers to talk to them; that's what they've been waiting on. Now they can beat it without looking like they been run out by our gang."  Cardon nodded. "Tell your boys to stay around for a while; they may expect you to leave right after they do, and then they'll try to slip back. You did a good job; got here promptly. Be seeing you, Goodkin."  He climbed into his own 'copter and started the motor.  "_Put the Literates in their place!_" the tri-dimensional colossus roared triumphantly after the retreating Independents. "_Our servants, not our masters!_"         *       *       *       *       *  At eight thousand, he got the 'copter onto the lower Manhattan beam and relaxed. First of all, he'd have to do something about answering Slade Gardner's telecast propaganda. That stuff was dangerous. The answer ought to go on the air by noon, and should be stepped up through the afternoon. First as a straight news story; Elliot Mongery had fifteen minutes, beginning at 1215--no, that wouldn't do. Mongery's sponsor for that time was Atomflame Heaters, and Atomflame was a subsidiary of Canada Northwest Fissionables, and Canada Northwest was umbilicus-deep in that Kettle River lease graft that Pelton had sworn to get investigated as soon as he took office. Professional ethics wouldn't allow Mongery to say anything in Pelton's behalf on Atomflame's time. Well, there was Guthrie Parham, he came on at 1245, and his sponsor was all right. He'd call Parham and tell him what he wanted done.  [Illustration:]  The buzzer warned him that he was approaching the lower Manhattan beacon; he shifted to manual control, dropped down to the three-thousand-foot level, and set his selector beam for the signal from Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise. Down toward the tip of the island, in the section that had been rebuilt after that Stalin Mark XV guided missile had gotten through the counter-rocket defenses in 1987, he could see the quadrate cross of his goal, with public landing stages on each of the four arms, and the higher central block with its landing stage for freight and store personnel. Above the four public stages, helicopters swarmed like May flies--May flies which had mutated and invented ritual or military drill or choreography--coming in in four streams to the tips of the arms and rising vertically from the middle. There was about ten times the normal amount of traffic for this early in the morning. He wondered, briefly, then remembered, and cursed. That infernal sale!  Grudgingly, he respected Russell Latterman's smartness, and in consequence, the ability of Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves in selecting a good agent to plant in Pelton's store. Latterman gave a plausible impersonation of the Illiterate businessman, loyal Prime Minister of Pelton's commercial empire, Generalissimo in the perpetual war against Macy & Gimbel's. From that viewpoint, the sale was excellent business--Latterman had gotten the jump on all the other department stores for the winter fashions and fall sports trade. He had also turned the store into a madhouse at the exact time when Chester Pelton needed to give all his attention to the election.  Pressing the button that put on his private recognition signal, he rose above the incoming customers and began to drop toward the private landing stage, circling to get a view of the other four stages. Maybe the sale could be turned to some advantage, at that. A free souvenir with each purchase, carrying a Pelton-for-Senator picture-message--  He broke off, peering down at the five-hundred-foot-square landing stage above the central block, then brought his 'copter swooping down rapidly. The white-clad figures he had seen swarming up the helical escalator were not wearing the Ku Klux robes of the Independent-Conservative storm troops, as he had first feared--they were in Literate smocks, and among them were the black leather jackets and futuristic helmets of their guards. They were led, he saw, by Stephen S. Bayne, the store's Chief Literate; with him were his assistant, Literate Third Class Roger B. Feinberg, and the novices carrying books and briefcases and cased typewriters, and the guards, and every Literate employed in the store. Four or five men in ordinarily vivid-colored business suits were obviously expostulating about something. As he landed and threw back the transparent canopy, he could hear a babel of voices, above which Feinberg was crying: "Unfair! Unfair! Unfair to Organized Literacy!"  He jumped out and hurried over.         *       *       *       *       *  "But you simply can't!" a white-haired man in blue-and-orange business clothes was protesting. "If you do, the Associated Fraternities'll be liable for losses we incur; you know that!"  Bayne, his thin face livid with anger--and also, Cardon noticed, with what looked like a couple of fresh bruises--ignored him. Feinberg broke off his chant of "Unfair! Unfair!" long enough to answer:  "A Literate First Class has been brutally assaulted by the Illiterate owner of this store. Literate service for this store is, accordingly, being discontinued, pending a decision by the Grand Council of the local Fraternity."  Cardon grabbed the blue-and-orange clad man and dragged him to one side.  "What happened, Hutschnecker?" he demanded.  "They're walking out on us," Hutschnecker told him, unnecessarily. "The boss had a fight with Bayne; knocked him down a couple of times. Bayne tried to pull his tablet gun, and I grabbed it away from him, and somebody else grabbed Pelton before he could pull his, and a couple of store cops got all the other Literates in the office covered. Then Bayne put on the general-address system and began calling out the Literates--"  "Yes, but why did Pelton beat Bayne up?"  "Bayne made a pass at Miss Claire. I wasn't there when it happened; she came into the office--"  Cardon felt his face tighten into a frown of perplexity. That wasn't like Literate First Class Stephen S. Bayne. He made quite a hobby of pinching salesgirls behind the counter which was one thing; the boss' daughter was quite another.  "Where's Latterman?" he asked, looking around.  "Down in the office, with the others, trying to help Mr. Pelton. He's had another of those heart attacks--"  Cardon swore and ran for the descending escalator, running down the rotating spiral to the executive floor and jumping off into the gawking mob of Illiterate clerks crowded in the open doors of Pelton's office. He hit and shoved and elbowed and cursed them out of the way, and burst into the big room beyond, and then, for a moment, he was almost sorry he had come.  Pelton was slumped in his big relaxer chair, his face pale and twisted in pain, his breath coming in feeble gasps. His daughter was beside him, her blond head bent over him; Russell Latterman was standing to one side, watching intently. For an instant, Cardon was reminded of a tomcat watching a promising mouse hole.  "Claire!" Cardon exploded, "give him a nitrocaine bulb. Why are you all just standing around?"  Claire turned. "There are none," she said, looking at him with desperate eyes. "The box is empty; he must have used them all."  He shot a quick glance at Latterman, catching the sales manager before he could erase a look of triumph from his face. Things began to add up. Latterman, of course, was the undercover man for Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves and the rest of the Conservative faction at Literates' Hall, just as he, himself, was Lancedale's agent. Obsessed with immediate advantages and disadvantages, the Joyner-Graves faction wanted to secure the re-election of Grant Hamilton, and the way things had been going in the past two months, only Chester Pelton's death could accomplish that. Latterman had probably thrown out Pelton's nitrocaine capsules and then put Bayne up to insulting Pelton's daughter, knowing that a fit of rage would bring on another heart attack, which could be fatal without the medicine.  "Well, send for more!"  "The prescription's in the safe," she said faintly.  The office safe was locked, and only a Literate could open it. The double combination was neatly stenciled on the door, the numbers spelled out as words and the letters spelled in phonetic equivalents. All three of them--himself, Claire, and Russell Latterman--could read them. None of them dared admit it. Latterman was fairly licking his chops in anticipation. If Cardon opened the safe, Pelton's campaign manager stood convicted as a Literate. If Claire opened it, the gaggle of Illiterate clerks in the doorway would see, and speedily spread the news, that the daughter of the arch-foe of Literacy was herself able to read. Maybe Latterman hadn't really intended his employer to die. Maybe this was the situation he had really intended to contrive.  Chester Pelton couldn't be allowed to die. If Grant Hamilton were returned to the Senate, the long-range planning of William Lancedale would suffer a crushing setback, and the public reaction would be catastrophic. _The Plan comes first_, Lancedale had told him. He made his decision, and then saw that he hadn't needed to make it. Claire had straightened, left her father, crossed quickly to the safe, and was kneeling in front of it, her back stiff with determination, her fingers busy at the dials, her eyes going from them to the printed combination and back again. She swung open the door, skimmed through the papers inside, unerringly selected the prescription, and rose.  "Here, Russ; go get it filled at once," she ordered. "And hurry!"  Oh, no, you don't, Cardon thought. One chance is enough for you, Russ. He snatched the prescription from her and turned to Latterman.  "I'll get it," he told the sales manager. "You're needed for the sale; stay on the job here."  "But with the Literates walked out, we can't--"  Cardon blazed: "Do I have to teach you your business? Have a sample of each item set aside at the counter, and pile sales slips under it. And for unique items, just detach the tag and put it with the sales slip. Now get out of here, and get cracking with it!" He picked up the pistol that had been taken from Pelton when he had tried to draw it on Bayne, checking the chamber and setting the safety. "Know how to use this?" he asked Claire. "Then hang onto it, and stay close to your father. This wasn't any accident, it was a deliberate attempt on his life. I'll have a couple of store cops sent in here; see that they stay with you."  He gave her no chance to argue. Pushing Latterman ahead of him, he drove through the mob of clerks outside the door.  "... Course she can; didn't you see her open the safe?" he heard. "... Nobody but a Literate--" "Then she's a Literate, herself!"  A couple of centuries ago, they would have talked like that if it had been discovered that the girl were pregnant; a couple of centuries before that, they would have been equally horrified if she had been discovered to have been a Protestant, or a Catholic, or whatever the locally unpopular religion happened to be. By noon, this would be all over Penn-Jersey-York; coming on top of Slade Gardner's accusations--         *       *       *       *       *  He ran up the spiral escalator, stumbling and regaining his footing as he left it. Bayne and his striking Literates were all gone; he saw a sergeant of Pelton's store police and went toward him, taking his spare identity-badge from his pocket.  "Here," he said, handing it to the sergeant. "Get another officer, and go down to Pelton's office. Show it to Miss Pelton, and tell her I sent you. There's been an attempt on Chester Pelton's life; you're to stay with him. Use your own judgment, but don't let anybody, and that definitely includes Russell Latterman, get at him. If you see anything suspicious, shoot first and ask questions afterwards. What's your name, sergeant?"  "Coccozello, sir. Guido Coccozello."  "All right. There'll be a medic or a pharmacist--a Literate, anyhow--with medicine for Mr. Pelton. He'll ask for you, by name, and mention me. And there'll be another Literate, maybe; he'll know your name, and use mine. Hurry, now, sergeant."  He jumped into his 'copter, pulled forward the plexiglass canopy, and took off vertically to ten thousand feet, then, orienting himself, swooped downward toward a landing stage on the other side of the East River, cutting across traffic levels with an utter contempt for regulations.  The building on which he landed was one of the principal pharmacies; he spiraled down on the escalator to the main floor and went directly to the Literate in charge, noticing that he wore on his Sam Browne not only the badges of retail-merchandising, pharmacist and graduate chemist but also that of medic-in-training. Snatching a pad and pencil from a counter, he wrote hastily: _Your private office, at once; urgent and important._  Looking at it, the Literate nodded in recognition of Cardon's Literacy.  "Over this way, sir," he said, guiding Cardon to his small cubicle office.  "Here." Cardon gave him the prescription. "Nitrocaine bulbs. They're for Chester Pelton; he's had a serious heart attack. He needs these with all speed. I don't suppose I need tell you how many kinds of hell will break loose if he dies now and the Fraternities are accused, as the Illiterates' Organization will be sure to, of having had him poisoned."  "Who are you?" the Literate asked, taking the prescription and glancing at it. "That,"--he gestured toward Cardon's silver-laced black Mexican jacket--"isn't exactly a white smock."  Cardon had his pocket recorder in his hand. He held it out, pressing a concealed stud; the stylus-and-tablet insignia glowed redly on it for a moment, then vanished. The uniformed Literate nodded.  "Fill this exactly; better do it yourself, to make sure, and take it over to Pelton's yourself. I see you have a medic-trainee's badge. Ask for Sergeant Coccozello, and tell him Frank Cardon sent you." The Literate, who had not recognized him before, opened his eyes at the name and whistled softly. "And fix up a sedative to keep him quiet for not less than four nor more than six hours. Let me use your visiphone for a while, if you please."  The man in the Literate smock nodded and hurried out. Cardon dialed William R. Lancedale's private number. When Lancedale's thin, intense face appeared on the screen, he reported swiftly.  "The way I estimate it," he finished, "Latterman put Bayne up to making a pass at the girl, after having thrown out Pelton's nitrocaine bulbs. Probably told the silly jerk that Claire was pining away with secret passion for him, or something. Maybe he wanted to kill Pelton; maybe he just wanted this to happen."  "I assume there's no chance of stopping a leak?"  Cardon laughed with mirthless harshness. "That, I take it, was rhetorical."  "Yes, of course." Lancedale's face assumed the blank expression that went with a pause for semantic re-integration. "Can you cover yourself for about an hour?"  "Certainly. 'Copter trouble. Visits to campaign headquarters. An appeal on Pelton's behalf for a new crew of Literates for the store--"  "Good enough. Come over. I think I can see a way to turn this to advantage. I'm going to call for an emergency session of the Grand Council this afternoon, and I'll want you sitting in on it; I want to talk to you about plans now." He considered for a moment. "There's too much of a crowd at O'Reilly's, now; come the church way."  Breaking the connection, Cardon dialed again. A girl's face, over a Literate Third Class smock, appeared in the screen; a lovely golden voice chimed at him:  "Mineola High School; good morning, sir."  "Good morning. Frank Cardon here. Let me talk, at once, to your principal, Literate First Class Prestonby."         *       *       *       *       *  Ralph Prestonby cleared his throat, slipped a master disk into the recording machine beside his desk, and pressed the start button.  "Dear Parent or Guardian," he began. "Your daughter, now a third-year student at this school, has reached the age of eligibility for the Domestic Science course entitled, 'How To Win and Hold a Husband.' Statistics show that girls who have completed this valuable course are sooner, longer, and happier married than those who have not enjoyed its advantages. We recommend it most highly.  "However, because of the delicate nature of some of the visual material used, your consent is required. You can attach such consent to this disk by running it for at least ten seconds after the sign-off and then switching from 'Play' to 'Transcribe.' Kindly include your full name, as well as your daughter's, and place your thumbprint on the opposite side of the disk. Very sincerely yours, Literate First Class Ralph C. Prestonby, Principal."  He put the master disk in an envelope, checked over a list of names and addresses of parents and girl students, and put that in also. He looked over the winter sports schedule, and signed and thumbprinted it. Then he loaded the recorder with his morning's mail, switched to "Play," and started it. As he listened, he blew smoke rings across the room and toyed with a dagger, made from a file, which had been thrown down the central light-well at him a few days before. The invention of the pocket recorder, which put a half-hour's conversation on a half-inch disk, had done more to slow down business and promote inane correspondence than anything since the earlier inventions of shorthand, typewriters and pretty stenographers. Finally, he cleared the machine, dumping the whole mess into a basket and carrying it out to his secretary.  "Miss Collins, take this infernal rubbish and have a couple of the girls divide it between them, play it off, and make a digest of it," he said. "And here. The sports schedule, and this parental-consent thing on the husband-trapping course. Have them taken care of."  "This stuff," Martha Collins said, poking at the pile of letter disks. "I suppose about half of it is threats, abuse and obscenities, and the other half is from long-winded bores with idiotic suggestions and ill-natured gripes. I'll use that old tag line, again--'hoping you appreciate our brevity as much as we enjoyed yours--'"  "Yes. That'll be all right." He looked at his watch. "I'm going to make a personal building-tour, instead of using the TV. The animals are sort of restless, today. The election; the infantile compulsion to take sides. If you need me for anything urgent, don't use oral call. Just flash my signal, red-blue-red-blue, on the hall and classroom screens. Oh, Doug!"  Yetsko, his length of rubber hose under his arm, ambled out of Prestonby's private office, stopping to stub out his cigarette. The action reminded Prestonby that he still had his pipe in his mouth; he knocked it out and pocketed it. Together, they went into the hall outside.  "Where to, first, captain?" Yetsko wanted to know.  "Cloak-and-Dagger Department, on the top floor. Then we'll drop down to the shops, and then up through Domestic Science and Business and General Arts."  "And back here. We hope," Yetsko finished.         *       *       *       *       *  They took a service elevator to the top floor, emerging into a stockroom piled with boxes and crates and cases of sound records and cans of film and stacks of picture cards, and all the other impedimenta of Illiterate education. Passing through it to the other end, Prestonby unlocked a door, and they went down a short hall, to where ten or fifteen boys and girls had just gotten off a helical escalator and were queued up at a door at the other end. There were two Literate guards in black leather, and a student-monitor, with his white belt and rubber truncheon, outside the door.  Prestonby swore under his breath. He'd hoped they'd miss this, but since they hadn't, there was nothing for it but to fall in at the tail of the queue. One by one, the boys and girls went up, spoke briefly to the guards and the student-monitor, and were passed through the door, Each time, one of the guards had to open it with a key. Finally, it was Prestonby's turn.  "B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, T, V, X, Y," he recited to the guardians of the door.  "A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q, S, U, W, Y," the monitor replied solemnly. "The inkwell is dry, and the book is dusty."  "But tomorrow, there will be writing and reading for all," Prestonby answered.  The guard with the key unlocked the door, and he and Yetsko went through, into an utterly silent sound-proofed room, and from it into an inner, noisy, room, where a recorded voice was chanting:  "Hat--_huh-ah-tuh._ H-a-t. Box--_buh-oh-ksss_. B-o-x. Gun--_guh-uh-nnn_. G-u-n. Girl--_guh-ih-rrr-lll_," while pictures were flashed on a screen at the front, and words appeared under them.  There were about twenty boys and girls, of the freshman-year age-bracket at desk-seats, facing the screen. They'd started learning the alphabet when school had opened in September; now they had gotten as far as combining letters into simple words. In another month, they'd be as far as diphthongs and would be initiated into the mysteries of silent letters. Maybe sooner than that; he was finding that children who had not been taught to read until their twelfth year learned much more rapidly than the primary grade children in the Literate schools.  What he was doing here wasn't exactly illegal. It wasn't even against the strict letter of Fraternity regulations. But it had to be done clandestinely. What he'd have liked to have done would have been to have given every boy and girl in English I the same instruction this selected group was getting, but that would have been out of the question. The public would never have stood for it; the police would have had to intervene to prevent a riotous mob of Illiterates from tearing the school down brick by brick, and even if that didn't happen, the ensuing uproar inside the Fraternity would have blown the roof off Literates' Hall. Even Lancedale couldn't have survived such an explosion, and the body of Literate First Class Ralph N. Prestonby would have been found in a vacant lot the next morning. Even many of Lancedale's supporters would have turned on him in anger at this sudden blow to the Fraternities' monopoly of the printed Word.  So it had to be kept secret, and since adolescents in possession of a secret are under constant temptation to hint mysteriously in the presence of outsiders, this hocus-pocus of ritual and password and countersign had to be resorted to. He'd been in conspiratorial work of other kinds, and knew that there was a sound psychological basis for most of what seemed, at first glance, to be mere melodramatic claptrap.  He and Yetsko passed on through a door across the room, into another sound-proofed room. The work of soundproofing and partitioning the old stockroom had been done in the last semester of his first year at Mineola High, by members of the graduating class of building-trades students, who had then gone their several ways convinced that they had been working on a set of music-class practice rooms. The Board of Education had never even found out about it. In this second room, a Literate teacher, one of the Lancedale faction, had a reading class of twenty-five or thirty. A girl was on her feet, with a book in her hand, reading from it:      "We are not sure of sorrow;       And joy was never sure;     Today will die tomorrow;       Time stoops to no man's lure;     And love, grown faint and fretful     With lips but half regretful     Sighs, and with eyes forgetful       Weeps that no loves endure."  Then she handed the book--it was the only copy--to the boy sitting in front of her, and he rose to read the next verse. Prestonby, catching the teacher's eye, nodded and smiled. This was a third-year class, of course, but from h-a-t spells hat to Swinburne in three years was good work.  There were three other classes, a total of little over a hundred students. There was no trouble; they were there for one purpose only--to learn. He spoke with one of the teachers, whose class was busy with a written exercise; he talked for a while to another whose only duty at the moment was to answer questions and furnish help to a small class who were reading silently from a variety of smuggled-in volumes.  "Only a hundred and twenty, out of five thousand," Yetsko said to him, as they were dropping down in the elevator by which they had come. "Think you'll ever really get anything done with them?"  "I won't. Maybe they won't," he replied. "But the ones they'll teach will. They're just a cadre; it'll take fifty years before the effects are really felt. But some day--"  The shops--a good half of the school was trades-training--were noisy and busy. Here Prestonby kept his hand on his gas-projector, and Yetsko had his rubber hose ready, either to strike or to discard in favor of his pistol. The instructors were similarly on the alert and ready for trouble--he had seen penitentiaries where the guards took it easier. Carpentry and building trades. Machine shop. Welding. 'Copter and TV repair shops--he made a minor and relatively honest graft there, from the sale of rebuilt equipment. Even an atomic-equipment shop, though there was nothing in the place that would excite a Geiger more than the instructor's luminous-dial watch.  Domestic Science--Home Decorating, Home Handicrafts, Use of Home Appliances, Beautician School, Charm School. He and Yetsko sampled the products of the Cooking School, intended for the cafeteria, and found them edible if uninspired.  Business--classes in recording letters, using Illiterate business-machines, preparing Illiterate cards for same, filing recordings--always with the counsel, "When in doubt, consult a Literate."  General Arts--Spanish and French, from elaborate record players, the progeny of the old Twentieth Century Linguaphone. English, with recorded-speech composition, enunciation training, semantics, and what Prestonby called English Illiterature. The class he visited was drowsing through one of the less colorful sections of "Gone With The Wind." World History, with half the students frankly asleep through an audio-visual on the Feudal System, with planted hints on how nice a revival of same would be, and identifying the clergy of the Middle Ages with the Fraternities of Literates. American History, with the class wide awake, since Custer's Massacre was obviously only moments away.  "Wantta bet one of those little cherubs doesn't try to scalp another before the day's out?" Yetsko whispered.  Prestonby shook his head. "No bet. Remember that film on the Spanish Inquisition, that we had to discontinue?"  It was then that the light on the classroom screen, which had been flickering green and white, suddenly began flashing Prestonby's wanted-at-office signal.         *       *       *       *       *  Prestonby found Frank Cardon looking out of the screen in his private office. The round, ordinarily cheerful, face was serious, but the innocent blue eyes were as unreadable as ever. He was wearing one of the new Mexican _charro_-style jackets, black laced with silver.  "I can't see all your office, Ralph," he said as Prestonby approached. "Are you alone?"  "Doug Yetsko's all," Prestonby said, and, as Cardon hesitated, added: "Don't be silly, Frank; he's my bodyguard. What could I be in that he wouldn't know all about?"  Cardon nodded. "Well, we're in a jam up to here." A handwave conveyed the impression that the sea of troubles had risen to his chin. He spoke at some length, describing the fight between Chester Pelton and Stephen S. Bayne, the Literate strike at Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise, Pelton's heart attack, and the circumstances of Claire's opening the safe. "So you see," he finished. "Maybe Latterman tried to kill Pelton, maybe he just tried to do what he did. I can't take chances either way."  Prestonby thought furiously. "You say Claire's alone at the store with her father?"  "And a couple of store cops, sterling characters with the hearts of lions and the brains of goldfish," Cardon replied. "And Russ Latterman, and maybe four or five Conservative goons he's managed to infiltrate into the store."  Prestonby was still thinking, aloud, now. "Maybe they did mean to kill Pelton; in that case, they'll try again. Or maybe they only wanted to expose Claire's literacy. It's hard to say what else they'd try--maybe kidnap her, to truth-drug her and use her as a guest-artist on a Conservative telecast. I'm going over to the store, now."  "That's a good idea, Ralph. If you hadn't thought of it, I was going to suggest it. Land on the central stage, ask for Sergeant Coccozello of the store police, and give my name. Even aside from everything else, it'd be a good idea to have somebody there who can read and dares admit it, till a new crew of Literates can get there. You were speaking about the possibility of kidnaping; how about the boy? Ray?"  Prestonby nodded. "I'll have him come here to my office, and stay there till I get back; I'll have Yetsko stay with him." He turned to where the big man in black leather stood guard at the door. "Doug, go get Ray Pelton and bring him here. Check with Miss Collins for where he'd be, now." He turned back to the screen. "Anything else, Frank?"  "Isn't that enough?" the brewer-Literate demanded. "I'll call you at the store, after a while. 'Bye."  The screen darkened as Cardon broke the connection. Prestonby got to his feet, went to his desk, and picked up a pipe, digging out the ashes from the bowl with an ice pick that one of the teachers had taken from a sixteen-year-old would-be murderer. He checked his tablet gun, made sure that there was an extra loaded clip in the holster, and got two more spare clips from the arms locker. Then, to make sure, he called Pelton's store, talking for a while to the police sergeant Cardon had mentioned. By the time he was finished, the door opened and Yetsko ushered Ray Pelton in.  "What's happened?" the boy asked. "Doug told me that the Senator ... my father ... had another heart attack."  "Yes, Ray. I don't believe he's in any great danger. He's at the store, resting in his office." He went on to tell the boy what had happened, exactly and in full detail. He was only fifteen, but already he had completed the four-year reading course and he could think a great deal more logically than seventy per cent of the people who were legally entitled to vote. Ray listened seriously, and proved Prestonby's confidence justified by nodding.  "Frame-up," he said succinctly. "Stinks like a glue factory of a put-up job. Something's going to happen to Russ Latterman, one of these days."  "I think you'd better let Frank Cardon take care of him, Ray," Prestonby advised. "I think there are more angles to this than he told me. Now, I'm going over to the store. Somebody's got to stay with Claire. I want you to stay here, in this room. If anybody sends you any message supposed to be from me, just ignore it. It'll be a trap. If I want to get in touch with you, I'll call you, with vision-image."  "Mean somebody might try to kidnap me, or Claire, to force the Senator to withdraw, or something?" Ray asked, his eyes widening.  "You catch on quickly, Ray," Prestonby commended him. "Doug, you stay with Ray till I get back. Don't let him out of your sight for an instant. At noon, have Miss Collins get lunches for both of you sent up; if I'm not back by fifteen-hundred, take him to his home, and stay with him there."         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration:]  For half an hour, Frank Cardon made a flying tour of Radical-Socialist borough headquarters. Even at the Manhattan headquarters, which he visited immediately after his talk with Prestonby, the news had already gotten out. The atmosphere of optimistic triumph which had undoubtedly followed Mongery's telecast and his report on the Trotter Poll, had evaporated. The Literate clerical help was gathered in a tight knot, obviously a little worried, and just as obviously enjoying the reaction. In smaller and constantly changing groups, the volunteers, the paid helpers, the dirt-squirters, the goon gangs, gathered, talking in worried or frightened or angry voices. When Cardon entered and was recognized, there was a concerted movement toward him. His two regular bodyguards, both on leave from the Literate storm troops, moved quickly to range themselves on either side of him. With a gesture, he halted the others.  "Hold it!" he called. "I know what you're worried about. I was there when it happened, and saw everything."  He paused, to let them assimilate that, and continued: "Now get this, all of you! Our boss, and--_if he lives_--our next senator, was the victim of a deliberate murder attempt, by Literate First Class Bayne, who threw out his supply of nitrocaine bulbs and then goaded him into a heart attack which, except for his daughter, would have been fatal. Claire Pelton deserves the deepest gratitude of every Radical-Socialist in the state. She's a smart girl, and she saved the life of her father and our leader.  "But--she is _not_ a Literate!" he cried loudly. "All she did was something any of you could have done--something I've done, myself, so that I won't be locked out of my own safe and have to wait for a Literate to come and open, it for me. She simply kept her eye on the Literates who were opening the safe, and learned the combination from the positions to which they turned the dial. And you believe, on the strength of that, that she's a Literate? The next thing, you'll be believing that professional liar of a Slade Gardner. And you call yourselves politicians!" He fairly gargled obscenities.  Looking around, he caught sight of a pair who seemed something less than impressed with his account of it. Joe West, thick-armed, hairy-chested, blue-jowled; Horace Yingling, thin and gangling. They weren't Radical-Socialist party people; they were from the Political Action Committee of the Consolidated Illiterates Organization, and their slogan was simpler and more to the point than Chester Pelton's--the only good Literate is a dead Literate. He tensed himself and challenged them directly.  "Joe; Horace. How about you? Satisfied the Pelton girl isn't a Literate, now?"  Yingling looked at West, and West looked back at him questioningly. Evidently the _suavitor in modo_ was Yingling's province, and the _fortior in re_ was West's.  "Yeh, sure, Mr. Cardon," Yingling said dubiously. "Now that you explain it, we see how it was."         *       *       *       *       *  It was worse than that in some of the other boroughs. One fanatic, imagining that Cardon himself was a crypto-Literate, drew a gun. Cardon's guards disarmed him and beat him senseless. At another headquarters, some character was circulating about declaring that not only Claire Pelton but her younger brother, Ray, as well, were Literates. Cardon's two men hustled him out of the building, and, after about twenty minutes, returned alone. Cardon hoped that the body would not be found until after the polls closed, the next day.  Finally, leaving his guards with the 'copter at a public landing stage, he made his way, by devious routes, to William R. Lancedale's office, and found Lancedale at his desk, seeming not to have moved since he had showed his agent out earlier in the day.  "Well, we're in a nice puddle of something-or-other," Cardon greeted him. "On top of that Gardner telecast, this morning--"  "Guthrie Parham's taking care of that, and everything's going to be done to ridicule Gardner," Lancedale told him. "And even this business at the store can be turned to some advantage. Before we're through, we may gain more votes than we lose for Pelton. And we had an informal meeting--Joyner for Retail Merchandising, Starke for Grievance Settlements, and four or five others including myself, to make up a quorum. We had Bayne in, and heard his story of it, and we got a report from one of our stoolies in the store. Bayne thought he was due for a commendation; instead, he got an eat-out. Of course, it was a fact that Pelton'd hit him, and we can't have Literates punched around, regardless of provocation. So we voted to fine Pelton ten million for beating Bayne up, and to award him ten million for losses resulting from unauthorized withdrawal of Literate services. We ordered a new crew of Literates to the store, and we exiled Bayne to Brooklyn, to something called Stillman's Used Copter and Junk Bazaar. For the next few months, the only thing he'll find that's round and pinchable will be second-hand tires. But don't be too hard on him; I think he did us a favor."  "You mean, starting a rift between Pelton and the Consolidated Illiterates' Organization, which we can widen after the election?"  "No. I hadn't thought of it that way, Frank," Lancedale smiled. "It's an idea worth keeping in mind, and we'll exploit it, later. What I was thinking about was the more immediate problem of the election--"  The buzzer on Lancedale's desk interrupted, and a voice came out of the commo box:  "Message, urgent and private, sir. Source named as Sforza."  Cardon recognized the name. Maybe the Independent-Conservatives have troubles, too, he thought hopefully. Then Lancedale's video screen became the frame for an almost unbelievably commonplace set of features.  "Sforza, sir," the man in the screen said. "Sorry I'm late, but I was able to get out of the building only a few minutes ago, and I had to make sure I wasn't wearing a tail. I have two new facts. First, the Conservatives have been bringing storm troops in from outside, from Philadelphia, and from Wilkes-Scranton, and from Buffalo. They are being concentrated in lower Manhattan, in plain clothes, with only concealed weapons, and carrying their hoods folded up under their coats. Second, I overheard a few snatches of conversation between two of the Conservative storm troop leaders, as follows: '... Start it in China ... thirteen-thirty,' and '... Important to make it appear either spontaneous or planned for business motives.'"  "Try to get us more information, as quickly as possible," Lancedale directed. "Obviously, we should know, by about thirteen hundred, what's being planned."  "Right, sir." Lancedale's spy at Independent-Conservative headquarters nodded and vanished from the screen.  "What does it sound like to you, Frank?" Lancedale asked.  "China is obviously a code-designation for some place in downtown Manhattan, where the Conservative goon gangs are being concentrated. The only thing I can say is that it probably is not Chinatown. They'd either say 'Chinatown' and not 'China,' or they would use some code-designation that wasn't so close to the actual name," Cardon considered. "What they're going to start, at thirteen-thirty, which is only two hours and a half from now, is probably some kind of a riot."  "A riot which could arise from business motives," Lancedale added. "That sounds like the docks, or the wholesale district, or the garment district, or something like that." He passed his hand rapidly over the photoelectric eye of the commo box. "Get me Major Slater," he said; and, a little later, "Major, get a platoon out to Long Island, to Chester Pelton's home; have the place searched for possible booby traps, and maintain guard there till further notice. You'll have no trouble with the servants, they're all in our pay. That platoon must not, repeat not, wear uniform or appear to have any connection with the Fraternities. Put another platoon in Pelton's store. Concealed weapons, and plain clothes. They should carry their leather helmets in shopping bags, and roam about in the store, ostensibly shopping. And a full company, uniformed and armed with heavy weapons, alerted and ready for immediate 'copter movement." He went on to explain about the intelligence report and the conclusions drawn from it. The guards officer repeated back his instructions, and Lancedale broke the connection.  "Now, Frank," he said, "I told you that this revelation of Claire Pelton's Literacy can be turned to our advantage. There's to be a full Council meeting at thirteen hundred. Here's what I estimate Joyner and Graves will try to do, and here's what I'm going to do to counter it--"         *       *       *       *       *  A couple of men in the maroon uniform of Pelton's store police were waiting as Prestonby's 'copter landed on the top stage; one of them touched his cap-visor with his gas-billy in salute and said: "Literate Prestonby? Miss Pelton is expecting you; she's in her father's office. This way, if you please, sir."  He had hoped to find her alone, but when he entered the office, he saw five or six of the store personnel with her. Since opening her father's safe, she had evidently dropped all pretense of Illiteracy; there was a mass of papers spread on the big desk, and she was referring from one to another of them with the deft skill of a regular Fraternities Literate, while the others watched in fascinated horror.  "Wait a moment, Mr. Hutschnecker," she told the white-haired man in the blue and orange business suit with whom she had been talking, and laid the printed price-schedule down, advancing to meet him.  "Ralph!" she greeted him. "Frank Cardon told me you were coming. I--"  For a moment, he thought of the afternoon, over two years ago, when she had entered his office at the school, and he had recognized her as the older sister of young Ray Pelton.  "Professor Prestonby," she had begun, accusingly, "you have been teaching my brother, Raymond Pelton, to read!"  He had been prepared for that; had known that sooner or later there would be some minor leak in the security screen around the classrooms on the top floor.  "My dear Miss Pelton," he had protested pleasantly. "I think you've become overwrought over nothing. This pretense to Literacy is a phase most boys of Ray's age pass through; they do it just as they play air-pirates or hi-jackers a few years earlier. The usual trick is to memorize something heard from a record disk, and then pretend to read it from print."  "Don't try to kid me, professor. I know that Ray can read. I can prove it."  "And supposing he has learned a few words," he had parried. "Can you be sure I taught him? And if so, what had you thought of doing about it? Are you going to expose me as a corrupter of youth?"  "Not unless I have to," she had replied coolly. "I'm going to blackmail you, professor. I want you to teach me to read, too."  Now, with this gang of her father's Illiterate store officials present, a quick handclasp and a glance were all they could exchange.  "How is he, Claire?" he asked.  "Out of danger, for the present. There was a medic here, who left just before you arrived. He brought nitrocaine bulbs, and gave father something to make him sleep. He's lying down, back in his rest room." She led him to a door at the rear of the office and motioned him to enter, following him. "He's going to sleep for a couple of hours, yet."  The room was a sort of bedroom and dressing room, with a miniscule toilet and shower beyond. Pelton was lying on his back, sleeping; his face was pale, but he was breathing easily and regularly. Two of the store policemen, a sergeant and a patrolman, were playing cards on the little table, and the patrolman had a burp gun within reach.  "All right, sergeant," Claire said. "You and Gorman go out to the office. Call me if anything comes up that needs my attention, in the next few minutes."  The sergeant started to protest. Claire cut him off.  "There's no danger here. This Literate can be trusted; he's a friend of Mr. Cardon's. Works at the brewery. It's all right."  The two rose and went out, leaving the door barely ajar. Prestonby and Claire, like a pair of marionettes on the same set of strings, cast a quick glance at the door and then were in each other's arms. Chester Pelton slept placidly as they kissed and whispered endearments.  It was Claire who terminated the embrace, looking apprehensively at her slumbering father.  "Ralph, what's it all about?" she asked. "I didn't even know that you and Frank Cardon knew each other, let alone that he had any idea about us."  Prestonby thought furiously, trying to find a safe path through the tangle of Claire Pelton's conflicting loyalties, trying to find a path between his own loyalties and his love for her, wondering how much it would be safe to tell her.  "And Cardon's gone completely cloak-and-dagger-happy," she continued. "He's talking about plots against my father's life, and against me, and--"  "A lot of things are going on under cloaks, around here," he told her. "And under Literate smocks, and under other kinds of costume. And a lot of daggers are out, too. You didn't know Frank Cardon was a Literate, did you?"  Her eyes widened. "I thought I was Literate enough to spot Literacy in anybody else," she said. "No, I never even suspected--"  Somebody rapped on the door. "Miss Pelton," the sergeant's voice called. "Visiphone call from Literates' Hall."  Prestonby smiled. "I'll take it, if you don't mind," he said. "I'm acting-chief-Literate here, now, I suppose."  She followed him as he went out into Pelton's office. When he snapped on the screen, a young man in a white smock, with the Fraternities Executive Section badge, looked out of it. He gave a slight start when he saw Prestonby.  "Literate First Class Ralph N. Prestonby, acting voluntarily for Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise during emergency," he said.  "Literate First Class Armandez, Executive Section," the man in the screen replied. "This call is in connection with the recent attack of Chester Pelton upon Literate First Class Bayne."  "Continue, understanding that we admit nothing," Prestonby told him.  "An extemporary session of the Council has found Pelton guilty of assaulting Literate Bayne, and has fined him ten million dollars," Armandez announced.  "We enter protest," Prestonby replied automatically.  "Wait a moment, Literate. The Council has also awarded Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise damages to the extent of ten million dollars, for losses incurred by suspension of Literate service, and voted censure against Literate Bayne for ordering said suspension without consent of the Council. Furthermore, a new crew of Literates, with their novices, guards, et cetera, is being sent at once to your store. Obviously, neither the Fraternities, nor Pelton's, nor the public, would be benefitted by returning Literate Bayne or any of his crew; he has been given another assignment."  "Thank you. And when can we expect this new crew of Literates?" Prestonby asked.  The man in the screen consulted his watch. "Probably inside of an hour. We've had to do some re-shuffling; you know how these things are handled. And if you'll pardon me, Literate; just what are you doing at Pelton's? I understood that you were principal of Mineola High School."  "That's a good question." Prestonby hastily assessed the circumstances and their implications. "I'd suggest that you ask it of my superior, Literate Lancedale, however."  The Literate in the screen blinked; that was the equivalent, for him, of anybody else's jaw dropping to his midriff.  "Well! A pleasure, Literate. Good day."         *       *       *       *       *  "Miss Pelton!" The man in the blue-and-orange suit was still trying to catch her attention. "Where are we going to put that stuff? Russ Latterman's out in the store, somewhere, and I can't get in touch with him."  "What did you say it was?" she replied.  "Fireworks, for the Peace Day trade. We want to get it on sale about the middle of the month."  "This was a fine time to deliver them. Peace Day isn't till the Tenth of December. Put them down in the fireproof vault."  "That place is full of photographic film, and sporting ammunition, and other merchandise; stuff we'll have to draw out to replace stock on the shelves during the sale," the Illiterate objected.  "The weather forecast for the next couple of days is fair," Prestonby reminded her. "Why not just pile the stuff on the top stage, beyond the control tower, and put up warning signs?"  The man--Hutschnecker, Prestonby remembered hearing Claire call him--nodded.  "That might be all right. We could cover the cases with tarpaulins."  A buzzer drew one of the Illiterates to a handphone. He listened for a moment, and turned.  "Hey, there's a Mrs. H. Armytage Zydanowycz down in Furs; she wants to buy one of those mutated-mink coats, and she's only got half a million bucks with her. How's her credit?"  Claire handed Prestonby a black-bound book. "Confidential credit-rating guide; look her up for us," she said.  Another buzzer rasped, before Prestonby could find the entry on Zydanowycz, H. Armytage; the Illiterate office worker, laying down one phone, grabbed up another.  "They're all outta small money in Notions; every son and his brother's been in there in the last hour to buy a pair of dollar shoestrings with a grand-note."  "I'll take care of that," Hutschnecker said. "Wait till I call control tower, and tell them about the fireworks."  "How much does Mrs. H. Armytage Zydanowycz want credit for?" Prestonby asked. "The book says her husband's good for up to fifteen million, or fifty million in thirty days."  "Those coats are only five million," Claire said. "Let her have it; be sure to get her thumbprint, though, and send it up here for comparison."  "Oh, Claire; do you know how we're going to handle this new Literate crew, when they get here?"  "Yes, here's the TO for Literate service." She tossed a big chart across the desk to him. "I made a few notes on it; you can give it to whoever is in charge."         *       *       *       *       *  It went on, like that, for the next hour. When the new Literate crew arrived, Prestonby was delighted to find a friend, and a fellow-follower of Lancedale, in charge. Considering that Retail Merchandising was Wilton Joyner's section, that was a good omen. Lancedale must have succeeded to an extraordinary degree in imposing his will on the Grand Council. Prestonby found, however, that he would need some time to brief the new chief Literate on the operational details at the store. He was unwilling to bring Claire too prominently into the conference, although he realized that it would be a matter of half an hour, at the outside, before every one of the new Literate crew would have heard about her Literate ability. If she'd only played dumb, after opening that safe--  Finally, by 1300, the new Literates had taken over, and the sale was running smoothly again. Latterman was somewhere out in the store, helping them; Claire had lunch for herself and Prestonby sent up from the restaurant, and for a while they ate in silence, broken by occasional spatters of small-talk. Then she returned to the question she had raised and he had not yet answered.  "You say Frank Cardon's a Literate?" she asked. "Then what's he doing managing the Senator's campaign? Fifth-columning?"  He shook his head. "You think the Fraternities are a solid, monolithic, organization; everybody agreed on aims and means, and working together in harmony? That's how it's supposed to look, from the outside. On the inside, though, there's a bitter struggle going on between two factions, over policy and for control. One faction wants to maintain the _status quo_--a handful of Literates doing the reading and writing for an Illiterate public, and holding a monopoly on Literacy. They're headed by two men, Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves. Bayne was one of that faction."  He paused, thinking quickly. If Lancedale had gotten the upper hand, there was likely to be a revision of the Joyner-Graves attitude toward Pelton. In that case, the less he said to incriminate Russell Latterman, the better. Let Bayne be the villain, for a while, he decided.  "Bayne," he continued, "is one of a small minority of fanatics who make a religion of Literacy. I believe he disposed of your father's medicine, and then deliberately goaded him into a rage to bring on a heart attack. That doesn't represent Joyner-Graves policy; it was just something he did on his own. He's probably been disciplined for it, by now. But the Joyner-Graves faction are working for your father's defeat and the re-election of Grant Hamilton.  "The other faction is headed by a man you've probably never heard of, William R. Lancedale. I'm of his faction, and so is Frank Cardon. We want to see your father elected, because the socialization of Literacy would eventually put the Literates in complete control of the government. We also want to see Literacy become widespread, eventually universal, just as it was before World War IV."  "But Wouldn't that mean the end of the Fraternities?" Claire asked.  "That's what Joyner and Graves say. We don't believe so. And suppose it did? Lancedale says, if we're so incompetent that we have to keep the rest of the world in ignorance to earn a living, the world's better off without us. He says that every oligarchy carries in it the seeds of its own destruction; that if we can't evolve with the rest of the world, we're doomed in any case. That's why we want to elect your father. If he can get his socialized Literacy program adopted, we'll be in a position to load the public with so many controls and restrictions and formalities that even the most bigoted Illiterate will want to learn to read. Lancedale says, a private monopoly like ours is bad, but a government monopoly is intolerable, and the only way the public can get rid of it would be by becoming Literates, themselves."  She glanced toward the door of Pelton's private rest room.  "Poor Senator!" she said softly. "He hates Literacy so, and his own children are Literates, and his program against Literacy is being twisted against itself!"  "But you agree that we're right and he's wrong?" Prestonby asked. "You must, or you'd never have come to me to learn to read."  "He's such a good father. I'd hate to see him hurt," she said. "But, Ralph, you're my man. Anything you're for, I'm for, and anything you're against, I'm against."  He caught her hand, across the table, forgetful of the others in the office.  "Claire, now that everybody knows--" he began.         *       *       *       *       *  "_Top emergency! Top emergency!_" a voice brayed out of the alarm box on the wall. "_Serious disorder in Department Thirty-two! Serious disorder in Department Thirty-two!_"  The voice broke off as suddenly as it had begun, but the box was not silent. From it came a medley of shouts, curses, feminine screams and splintering crashes. Prestonby and Claire were on their feet.  "You have wall screens?" he asked. "How do they work? Like the ones at school?"  Claire twisted a knob until the number 32 appeared on a dial, and pressed a button. On the screen, the Chinaware Department on the third floor came to life in full sound and color. The pickup must have been across an aisle from the box from whence the alarm had come; they could see one of Pelton's Illiterate clerks lying unconscious under it, and the handphone dangling at the end of its cord. The aisles were full of jostling, screaming women, trampling one another and fighting frantically to get out, and, among them, groups of three or four men were gathered back to back. One such group had caught a store policeman; three were holding him while a fourth smashed vases over his head, grabbing them from a nearby counter. A pink dinner plate came skimming up from the crowd, narrowly missing the wired TV pickup. A moment later, a blue-and-white sugar bowl, thrown with better aim, came curving at them in the screen. It scored a hit, and brought darkness, though the bedlam of sound continued.  [Illustration:]  [Illustration:]  Cardon looked at his watch as he entered the Council Chamber at Literates' Hall, smoothing his smock hastily under his Sam Browne. He'd made it with very little time to spare, before the doors would be sealed and the meeting would begin. He'd been all over town, tracking down that report of Sforza's; he'd even made a quick visit to Chinatown, on the off chance that "China" had been used in an attempt at the double concealment of the obvious, but, as he'd expected, he'd found nothing. The people there hardly knew there was to be an election. Accustomed for millennia to ideographs read only by experts, they viewed the current uproar about Literacy with unconcern.  At the door, he deposited his pocket recorder--no sound-recording device was permitted, except the big audio-visual camera in front, which made the single permanent record. Going around the room counterclockwise to the seats of his faction, he encountered two other Lancedale men: Gerald K. Toppington, of the Technological Section, thin-faced, sandy-haired, balding; and Franklin R. Chernov, commander of the local Literates' guards brigade, with his ragged gray mustache, his horribly scarred face, and his outsize tablet-holster almost as big as a mail-order catalogue.  "What's Joyner-Graves trying to do to us, Frank?" Chernov rumbled gutturally.  "It's what we're going to do to them," Cardon replied. "Didn't the chief tell you?"  Chernov shook his head. "No time. I only got here fifteen minutes ago. Chasing all over town about that tip from Sforza. Nothing, of course. Nothing from Sforza, either. The thing must have been planned weeks ago, whatever it is, and everybody briefed personally, and nothing on disk or tape about it. But what's going to happen here? Lancedale going to pull a rabbit out of his hat?"  Cardon explained. Chernov whistled. "Man, that's no rabbit; that's a full-grown Bengal tiger! I hope it doesn't eat us, by mistake."  Cardon looked around, saw Lancedale in animated argument with a group of his associates. Some of the others seemed to be sharing Chernov's fears.  "I have every confidence in the chief," Toppington said. "If his tigers make a meal off anybody, it'll be--" He nodded in the direction of the other side of the chamber, where Wilton Joyner, short, bald, pompous, and Harvey Graves, tall and cadaverous, stood in a Rosencrantz-Guildenstern attitude, surrounded by half a dozen of their top associates.  The Council President, Morehead, came out a little door onto the rostrum and took his seat, pressing a button. The call bell began clanging slowly. Lancedale, glancing around, saw Cardon and nodded. On both sides of the chamber, the Literates began taking seats, and finally the call bell stopped, and Literate President Morehead rapped with his gavel. The opening formalities were hustled through. The routine held-over business was rubber-stamped with hasty votes of approval, even including the decisions of the extemporary meeting of that morning on the affair at Pelton's. Finally, the presiding officer rapped again and announced that the meeting was now open for new business.  At once, Harvey Graves was on his feet.  "Literate President," he began, as soon as the chair had recognized him, "this is scarcely _new_ business, since it concerns a problem, a most serious problem, which I and some of my colleagues have brought to the attention of this Council many times in the past--the problem of Black Literacy!" He spat out the two words as though they were a mouthful of poison. "Literate President and fellow Literates, if anything could destroy our Fraternities, to which we have given our lives' devotion, it would be the widespread tendency to by-pass the Fraternities, the practice of Literacy by non-Fraternities people--"  "We've heard all that before, Wilton!" somebody from the Lancedale side called out. "What do you want to talk about that you haven't gotten on every record of every meeting for the last thirty years?"  "Why, this Pelton business," Graves snapped back at him. "You know what I mean. Your own associates are responsible for it!" He turned back to face the chair, and, with a surprising minimum of invective, described the scene in which Claire Pelton had demonstrated her Literacy. "And that's not all, brother Literates," he continued. "Since then, I've been receiving reports from the Pelton store. Claire Pelton has been openly doing the work of a Literate; going over the store's written records, checking inventories, checking the credit guide, handling the price lists--"  "What's that got to do with Black Literacy?" Gerald Toppington demanded. "Black Literacy is a term which labels the professional practice of Literacy, for hire, by a non-Fraternity Literate, or Literate service furnished for criminal or politically subversive purposes, or the betrayal of a client by a Fraternity Literate. There's nothing of the sort involved here. This girl, who does appear to be Literate, is simply looking after the interests of her family's business."  "She was taught by a Literate, a Fraternities-member, under, to say the very least, irregular circumstances, and without payment of any fee. Any fee, that is, that the Fraternities can collect any percentage on. And the Literate who taught her also taught her younger brother, Ray Pelton, and this Literate, who is known to be her lover--"  "Suppose he is her lover, so what?" one of Lancedale's partisans demanded. "You say, yourself, that she's a Literate. That ought to remove any objection. Why, if she were to come forward and admit and demonstrate her Literacy, there'd be no possible objection from the Fraternities' viewpoint to her marrying young Prestonby."  "And as for Prestonby's action in teaching Literacy to her and to her brother," Cardon spoke up, "I think he deserves the thanks and commendation of the Fraternities. He's put a period to four generations of bigoted Illiterates."  Wilton Joyner was on his feet. "Will Literate Graves yield for a motion?" he asked. "Thank you, Harvey. Literate President, and brother Literates: I yield to no man in my abhorrence of Black Literacy, or in my detestation for the political principles of which Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman, but I deny that we should allow the acts and opinions of the Illiterate parent to sway us in our consideration of the Literate children. It has come to my notice, as it has to Literate Graves', that this young woman, Claire Pelton, is Literate to a degree that would be a credit to any Literate First Class, and her brother can match his Literacy creditably against that of any novice in our Fraternities. To show that we respect Literate ability, wherever we find it; to show that we are not the monopolistic closed-corporation our enemies accuse us of being; to show that we are not animated by a vindictive hatred of anything bearing the name of Pelton--I move, and ask that my motion be presented for seconding, that Claire Pelton, and her brother, Raymond Pelton, be duly elected, respectively, to the positions of Literate Third Class and Literate Novice, as members of the Associated Fraternities of Literates!"  From the Joyner-Graves side, there were dutiful cries of, "Yes! Yes! Admit the young Peltons!" and also gasps of horrified surprise from the rank-and-filers who hadn't been briefed on what was coming up.  Lancedale was on his feet in an instant. "Literate President!" he cried. "In view of the delicate political situation, and in view of Chester Pelton's violent denunciation of our Fraternities--"  "Literate Lancedale," the President objected. "The motion is not to be debated until it has been properly seconded."  "What does the Literate President think I'm doing?" Lancedale retorted. "I second the motion!"  Joyner looked at Lancedale in angry surprise, which gradually became fearful suspicion. His stooge, who had already risen with a prepared speech of seconding, simply gaped.  "Furthermore," Lancedale continued, "I move an amendment to Literate Joyner's motion. I move that the ceremony of the administration of the Literates' Oath, and the investiture in the smock and insignia, be carried out as soon as possible, and that an audio-visual recording be made, and telecast this evening, before twenty-one hundred."  Brigade commander Chernov, prodded by Cardon, jumped to his feet.  "Excellent!" he cried. "I second the motion to amend the motion of Literate Joyner."  If there were such a thing as a bomb which would explode stunned silence, Lancedale and Chernov had dropped such a bomb. Cardon could guess how Joyner and Graves felt; they were now beginning to be afraid of their own proposition. As for the Lancedale Literates, he knew how many of them felt. He'd felt the same way, himself, when Lancedale had proposed the idea. He got to his feet.  "Literate President, brother Literates," he raised his voice. "I call for an immediate vote on this amended motion, which I, personally, endorse most heartily, and which I hope to see carried unanimously."  "Now, wait a minute!" Joyner objected. "This motion ought to be debated--"  "What do you want to debate about it?" Chernov demanded. "You presented it, didn't you?"  "Well, I wanted to give the Council an opportunity to discuss it, as typical of our problems in dealing with Black ... I mean, non-Fraternities ... Literacy--"  "You mean, you didn't know it was loaded!" Cardon told him. "Well, that's your hard luck; we're going to squeeze the trigger!"  "I withdraw the motion!" Joyner shouted.  "Literate President," Lancedale said gently, his thin face lighting with an almost saintly smile, "Literate Joyner simply cannot withdraw his motion, now. It has been properly seconded and placed before the house, and so has my own humble contribution to it. I demand that the motion be acted upon."  "Vote! Vote! Vote!" the Lancedale Literates began yelling.  "I call on all my adherents to vote against this motion!" Joyner shouted.  "Now look here, Wilton!" Harvey Graves shouted, reddening with anger. "You're just making a fool out of me. This was your idea, in the first place! Do you want to smash everything we've ever done in the Fraternities?"  "Harvey, we can't go on with it," Joyner replied. He crossed quickly to Graves' seat and whispered something.  "For the record," Lancedale said sweetly, "our colleague, Literate Joyner, has just whispered to Literate Graves that since I have seconded his motion, he's now afraid of it. I think Literate Graves is trying to assure him that my support is merely a bluff. For the information of this body, I want to state categorically that it is not, and that I will be deeply disappointed if this motion does not pass."  An elderly Literate on the Joyner-Graves side, an undersized man with a bald head and a narrow mouth, was on his feet. He looked like an aged rat brought to bay by a terrier.  "I was against this fool idea from the start!" he yelled. "We've got to keep the Illiterates down; how are we ever going to do that if we go making Literates out of them? But you two thought you were being smart--"  "Shut up and sit down, you old jackass!" one of Joyner's people shouted at him.  "Shut up, yourself, Ginter," a hatchet-faced woman Literate from the Finance Section squawked.  Literate President Morehead, an amiable and ineffective maiden aunt in trousers, pounded frantically with his gavel. "Order!" he fairly screamed. "This is disgraceful!"  "You can say that again!" Brigade commander Chernov boomed. "What do you people over on the right think this is; an Illiterates' Organization Political Action meeting?"  "Vote! Vote!" Cardon bellowed.  Literate President Morehead banged his gavel and, in a last effort, started the call bell clanging.  "The motion has been presented and seconded; the amendment has been presented and seconded. It will now be put to a vote!"  "Roll call!" Cardon demanded. Four or five other voices, from both sides of the chamber, supported him.  "The vote will be by roll call," Literate President Morehead agreed. "Addison, Walter G."  "Aye!" He was a subordinate of Harvey Graves.  "Agostino, Pedro V."  "Aye!" He was a Lancedale man.  So it went on. Graves voted for the motion. Joyner voted against it. All the Lancedale faction, now convinced that their leader had the opposition on the run, voted loudly for it.  "The vote has been one hundred and eighty-three for, seventy-two against," Literate President Morehead finally announced. "The motion is herewith declared carried. Literate Lancedale, I appoint you to organize a committee to implement the said motion, at once."         *       *       *       *       *  Prestonby flung open the door of the rest room where Sergeant Coccozello and his subordinate were guarding the unconscious Pelton.  "Sergeant! Who's in charge of store police, now?"  Coccozello looked blank for an instant. "I guess I am," he said. "Lieutenant Dunbar's off on his vacation, in Mexico, and Captain Freizer's in the hospital; he was taken sick suddenly last evening."  Probably poisoned, Prestonby thought, making a mental note to find out which hospital and get in touch with one of the Literate medics there.  "Well, come out here, sergeant, and have a look around the store on the TV. We have troubles."  Coccozello could hear the noise that was still coming out of the darkened screen. As he stepped forward, Claire got another pickup, some distance from the one that had been knocked out. A mob of women customers were surging away from the Chinaware Department, into Glassware; they were running into the shopping crowd there, with considerable disturbance. A couple of store police were trying to get through the packed mass of humanity, and making slow going of it. Coccozello swore and started calling on his reserves on one of the handphones.  "Wait a moment, sergeant," Prestonby stopped him. "Don't commit any of your reserves down there. We're going to need them to hold the executive country, up here. This is only the start of a general riot."  "Who are you and what do you know about it?" Coccozello challenged.  "Listen to him, Guido," Claire said. "He knows what he's doing."  "Claire, you have some way of keeping a running count of the number of customers in and out of the store, haven't you?" Prestonby asked.  "Why, yes; here." She pointed to an indicator on Chester Pelton's desk, where constantly changing numbers danced.  "And don't you have a continuous check on sales, too? How do they jibe?"  "They don't; look. Sales are away below any expectation from the number of customers, even allowing for shopping habits of a bargain-day crowd. But what's that got to do--"  Prestonby was back at the TV, shifting from pickup to pickup.  "Look, sergeant, Claire. That isn't a normal bargain-day crowd, is it? Look at those groups of men, three or four to a group, shifting around, waiting for something to happen. This store's been infiltrated by a big goon gang. That business in Chinaware's just the start, to draw our reserves down to the third door. Look at that, now."  He had a pickup on the twelfth floor, the floor just under the public landing stages, and at the foot of the escalators leading to the central executive block.  "See how they're concentrating, there?" he pointed out. "In that ladies' wear department, there are three men for every woman, and the men are all drifting from counter to counter over in the direction of our escalators."  Coccozello swore again, feelingly. "Literate, you know your stuff!" he said. "That fuss in China is just a feint; this is where they're really going to hit. What do you think it is? Macy & Gimbel's trying to bust up our sale, or politics?"  Prestonby shrugged. "Take your choice. A competitor would concentrate where your biggest volume of sale was going on, though; political enemies would try to get up here, and that's what this gang's trying to do."  "He's absolutely right, Guido," Claire told the sergeant. "Do whatever he tells you."  Sergeant Coccozello looked at him, awaiting orders.  "We can't commit our reserves in that Chinaware Department fight; we need them up here. Where are they, now, and how many?"  "Thirteen, counting myself and the man in there." He nodded toward the room where Chester Pelton lay in drugged sleep. "In the squad room, on the floor below."  "And for the mob below to get up here?"  "Two escalators, sir, northeast and southwest corners of office country. And we got some new counters that Mr. Latterman had built, that didn't get put out in time for the sale. We can use them to build barricades, if we have to."  "How about a 'copter attack on the roof?"  Coccozello grinned. "I'd like to see that, now, Literate. We got plenty of A-A equipment up there--four 7-mm machine guns, two 12-mm's, and one 20-mm auto-cannon. We could hold off the State Guard with that."  "That isn't saying much, but they're not even that good. So it'll be the escalators. Think, now, sergeant. Fires, burglary, holdups--"  The sergeant's grin widened. "High-pressure fire hose, one at the head of each escalator, and a couple more that can be dragged over from other outlets. Say we put two men on each hose, lying down at the head of the escalators. And we got plenty of firearms; we can arm some of these clerks, up here--"  "All right; do that. And put out an emergency call, by inter-department telephone, not by public address, to floorwalkers from the fifth floor down, to gather up all male clerks and other store personnel in their departments, arm them with anything they can find, and rush them to Chinaware. Tell them to shout 'Pelton!' when they hit the mob, to avoid breaking each others' heads in the confusion, and tell them they're expected to hold the Chinaware and Glassware departments themselves, without any help from the store police."  "Why not?" Claire wanted to know.  "That's how battles come to happen at the wrong time and place," Prestonby told her. "Two small detachments collide, and each sends back for re-enforcements, and the next thing anybody knows, there's a full-size battle going on where nobody wants to fight one. We're going to fight our main battle at the head of the escalators from the twelfth floor."  "You've done this sort of work before, Literate," Coccozello grinned. "You talk like a storm-troop captain. What else?"  "Well, so far, we've just been talking defense. We need to take the offensive, ourselves." He glanced around. "Is there a freight elevator from this block to the basement?"  "Yeah. Wait till I see." Coccozello went to the TV-screen and dialed. "Yeah, and the elevator's up here, too," he said.  "Well, you take what men you can spare--a couple of your cops, and a couple of the office crew--arm them with pistols, carbines, clubs, whatever you please, and take them down to the basement. Gather up all the warehouse gang, down there, and arm them. And as soon as you get to the basement, send the elevator back up here. That's our life line; we can't risk having it captured. You'll organize flying squads to go up into the store from the basement. Bust up any trouble that seems to be getting started, if you can, but your main mission will be to rescue store police, Literates, Literates' guards, and store help, and get them back to the basement. They'll be picked up from there and brought up here on the elevator." He picked up a pad from a desk and wrote a few lines on it. "Show this to any Literate you meet; get Literate Hopkinson to countersign it for you, when you find him. Tell him we want his whole gang up here as soon as possible."  "How about getting help from outside?" Claire asked. "The city police, or--"  "City police won't lift a finger," Prestonby told her. "They never help anybody who has a private police force; they have too much to do protecting John Q. Citizen. Hutschnecker; suppose you call Radical-Socialist campaign headquarters; tell them to rush some of their Lone Rangers around here--"         *       *       *       *       *  [Illustration:]  Russell M. Latterman was lunching in the store restaurant, at a table next the thick glass partition, where he could look out across Confectionery and Pastries toward the Tobacco Shoppe and the Liquor Department. There were two ways of looking at it, of course. He was occupying a table that might have been used by a customer, but, on the other hand, he was known by sight to many of the customers, and the fact that he was eating here had some advertising value, and he could keep his eye on the business going on around him. Off in the distance, he caught the white flash of a Literate smock at one of the counters; one of the new crew sent in to replace the ones Bayne had pulled out. He was glad and at the same time disturbed. He had had his doubts about staging a Literates' strike, and he was almost positive that Wilton Joyner had known nothing about it. The whole thing had been Harvey Graves' idea. There was a serious question of Literate ethics involved, to say nothing of the effect on the public. The trick of forcing Claire Pelton to reveal her secret Literacy was all right, although he wished that it had been Frank Cardon who had opened that safe. Or did he? Cardon would have brazened it out, claimed to have memorized the combination after having learned it by observation, and would probably have gotten away with it. But that silly girl had lost her head afterward, and had gone on to brand herself, irrevocably, as a Literate.  One of the waitresses was hurrying toward him, almost falling over herself in excitement. She began talking when she was ten feet from the table.  "Mr. Latterman! Mr. Latterman!" she was calling to him. "A terrible fight, down in Chinaware--!"  "Well, what do we have store police for?" he demanded. "They can take care of it. Now be quiet, Madge; don't get the customers excited!"  He returned to his lunch, watching, with satisfaction, the crowd that was packing into the Liquor Department, next to the restaurant. That special loss-leader, Old Atom-Bomb Rye, had been a good idea. In the first place, the stuff was fit for nothing but cleaning drains and removing varnish; if he were Pelton, he would have fired that fool buyer who got them overstocked on it. But the audio-advertiser, outside, was reiterating: "_Choice whiskies, two hundred dollars a sixth and up!_" and pulling in the customers, who, when they discovered that the two-hundred-dollar bargain was Old Atom-Bomb, were shelling out five hundred to a grand a sixth for good liquor.  He finished his coffee and got to his feet. Be a good idea to look in on Liquor, and see how things were going. The department was getting more and more crowded every minute; three customers were entering for every one who left.  On the way, he passed two women, and caught a snatch of conversation:  "Don't go down on the third floor, for Heaven's sake ... terrible fight ... smashing everything up--"  Worried, he continued into Liquor, and the looks of the crowd there increased his worries. Too many men between twenty and thirty, all dressed alike, looking alike, talking and acting alike. It looked like a goon-gang infiltration, and he was beginning to see why Harvey Graves had wanted the Literates pulled out, and why Joyner, bound by ethics to do nothing against the commercial interests of Pelton's, had known nothing about it. He started toward a counter, to speak to a clerk, but one of the stocky, quietly-dressed young men stepped in front of him.  "Gimme a bottle of Atom-Bomb," he said. "Don't bother wrapping it."  "Yes, sir." The clerk seemed worried, too. He got the bottle and set it on the counter. "That'll be two C, sir."  "I see you're wearing a Radical-Socialist button," the customer commented. "Because you want to, or because Chet Pelton makes you?"  "Mr. Pelton never interferes with his employees' political convictions," the clerk replied loyally.  Saying nothing, the customer took the bottle, swung it by the neck, and smashed it over the clerk's head, knocking him senseless.  "That's all that rotgut's good for," the customer said, jumping over the counter. "All right, boys; help yourselves!"         *       *       *       *       *  For a surprisingly long time, the riot was localized in China, where it had begun. Using, alternately, three TV-pickups around the scene of the disturbance, Prestonby watched its progress, and watched successive details of store personnel, armed with clubs and a few knives and sono pistols, hit the riot, shouting their battle cry, and vanish. They were, of course, lambs of sacrifice, however unlamblike their conduct. They were buying time, and they were drawing groups of goons into the action in China and Glassware who might have been making trouble elsewhere.  There was an outbreak on the sixth floor, in Liquor; Claire, touring the store on the other TV-screen, spotted it and called his attention to it. Back of the shattered glass partition, a mob of men were snatching bottles from the shelves and tossing them out to the crowd. One of the clerks, in his gray uniform jacket, was lying unconscious outside. While Prestonby watched, another, and another, came flying out the doorway. A fourth victim, in ordinary business clothes, tattered and disheveled, came flying out after them, to land in a heap, stunned for an instant, and then pick himself up. Prestonby laughed heartily when he recognized Literate--undercover--First Class Russell M. Latterman.  "I ought to have anticipated that," he said. "Any time there's a riot, the liquor stores are the first things looted. The liquor stores, and the--Claire! See what's going on in Sporting Goods!"  Sporting Goods, between Tools & Hardware and Toys, on the fifth floor, was swamped. One of the clerks was lying on the floor in a puddle of blood, past any help; none of the others were in sight. The gun racks and pistol cases were being cleaned out systematically. This had been organized in advance. There were four or five men working industriously wiping grease out of bores and actions before handing out firearms, and a couple more making sure that the right cartridges went with each weapon. Somebody had brought a small grinding wheel over from Tools and plugged it in, and was grinding points on the foils and epees. Others were collecting baseball bats, golf clubs, and football helmets and catchers' masks. The Tool Department was being stripped of everything that could be used as a weapon, too.  The whole store, by this time, was an approximation of Mutiny in a Madhouse. Dressgoods was being looted by a howling mob of women, who were pulling bolts of material from shelves and fighting among themselves over them. Somebody had turned on the electric fans, and long streams of flimsy fabric were blowing about like a surrealist maypole dance. Somebody in Household Furnishings had turned on a couple of fans, too, and a mob of hoodlums were opening cans of paint and throwing them into the fan blades.  The little Antiques Department, in a corner of the fourth floor back of the Gift Shoppe, was an island of peace in the general chaos. There was only one way into it, and one of the clerks, who had gotten himself into a suit of Fifteenth Century battle armor, was standing in the entrance, leaning on a two-hand sword. There was blood on the long blade, and more blood splashed on the floor in front of him. He was being left entirely alone.         *       *       *       *       *  Hutschnecker, called to the telephone, spoke briefly, listened for a while, spoke again in hearty thanks, and hung up.  "Macy & Gimbel's," he told Prestonby. "They heard about our trouble--probably one of their price-spotters phoned in about it--and they're offering to send twenty of their store-cops to help us out. They'll be landing on our stage in eight minutes, rifles and steel helmets."  Prestonby nodded. It would have been quite conceivable that Pelton's chief competitor had started the riot; since they hadn't, their offer of armed aid was just as characteristic of the bitter but mutually-respectful rivalries of the commercial world. A few minutes later, another call came in, this time on the visiphone. Prestonby took it when he saw a Literates' Guards officer in the screen and recognized him.  "That you, Prestonby?" the officer, Major Slater, asked in some surprise. "Didn't know you were at Pelton's. What's going on, there?"  Prestonby told him, briefly.  "Yes; we had some of our people at the store, in plain clothes," Slater said. "Just in case of trouble. On Mr. L.'s orders. They reported a riot starting, but naturally, their reports were incomplete. Can you get one of your landing stages cleared for us? We have two hundred men, in twenty 'copters." Then he must have noticed some of the store Illiterates back of Prestonby, and realized that this offer of help to Literacy's worst enemy would arouse suspicion. "Not that we care what happens to Chester Pelton, but we have to protect our own people at the store."  "Yes, of course," Prestonby agreed. "Come in on our north stage. You'll probably find a fight going on on our twelfth floor, just inside. Anybody who's trying to get up the escalators to the office block will be an enemy."  "Right. We're halfway there now." The Literates' Guards officer broke the connection.  "You heard that?" he asked, turning to the others in the office. "If we can hold out till they get here, we're all right. Did you contact Radical-Socialist headquarters, yet, Hutschnecker?"  "Yes. I talked to a fellow named Yingling. He said that all the party storm troops had been lured out to some kind of a disturbance in North Jersey Borough; he'd try to get them recalled."  Prestonby swore bitterly. "By the time his own party-goons get here, the Literates' Guards and Macy & Gimbel's will have pulled Pelton's bacon off the fire for him. Nice friends he has!"  An alarm buzzer went off suddenly, and an urgent voice came out of the box on the wall:  "Here come the goons! South escalator!"  Prestonby grabbed a burp gun and a canvas musette bag full of clips. By the time he had gotten down to what, in deference to the superstitions of the Illiterate store force, was known as the fourteenth floor, an attack on the north escalator had developed as well. In both cases, the attackers seemed to expect no organized resistance. They simply jumped onto the escalators, adding their own running speed, and came rushing up, firing pistols ahead of them at random.  The defenders, however, had been ready: the fire hoses caught those in the lead and hurled them back. Some of them vaulted the barrier between the ascending and descending spirals and let themselves be carried down again. Less than five minutes after the buzzer had sounded the warning, the attack stopped. The noise on the twelfth floor increased, however, and, leaning over into the escalator-way, Prestonby could see the rioters firing in the direction of the entrance from the north landing stage. Within a matter of thirty seconds, they began to flee, and a wave of Literates' Guards, in their futuristic "space cadet" uniforms, came pouring in after them.         *       *       *       *       *  Douglass MacArthur Yetsko put the burp gun back together again, tried the action, and laid it aside with a sigh. He had cleaned every weapon in his and Prestonby's private arsenal, since lunch, and now he had to admit the unpalatable fact that there was nothing left to do but turn on the TV. Ray had been no company at all; the boy hadn't spoken a word since he'd started rummaging among the captain's books. Gloomily, he snapped on the screen to sample the soap shows.  Della Pallas was in jail again, this time accused of murdering the lawyer who had gotten her acquitted on a previous murder rap. Considering the fact that she had languished in jail for almost a year during the other trial, Yetsko felt that she had a sound motive. Rudolf Barstow, in "Broadway Wife," was, like Bruce's spider, spinning his five hundredth web to ensnare the glamorous Marie Knobble. And there was a show about a schoolteacher and her class of angelic little tots that almost brought Yetsko's lunch up.  He shifted the dial again; a young Literate announcer was speaking quickly, excitedly:  "... Scene of the riot, already the worst this year, and growing steadily worse. We take you now to downtown Manhattan, where our portable units and commentators have just arrived, and switch you to Ed Morgan."  The screen went black, and Yetsko swore angrily. Ray lifted his head quickly from his book and reached for the sono pistol Yetsko had given him.  "Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and just a moment, until we can give you the picture. We're having what is usually labeled as 'slight technical difficulties,' in this case the difficulty of avoiding having a hole shot in our camera or in your commentator's head. Yes, that's shooting you hear; there, somebody's using an auto rifle! How are you coming, Steve?"  A voice muttered something which, two centuries ago, would have caused an earth-shaking scandal in the whole radio-TV industry.  "Well, till Steve gets things fixed up, a brief review, to date, of what's sure to go down in history as the Battle of Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise--"  "Huh?" Ray fairly shouted, the book forgotten.  "... Started in the Chinaware Department, as a relatively innocent brawl, and spread to the Liquor Department, and then, all of a sudden, everybody started playing rough. At first, it was suspected that Macy & Gimbel's had sent a goon gang around to break up Pelton's fall sale, but when the former concern rallied to the assistance of their competitor with a force of twenty riflemen, that began to look less likely, and we're beginning to think that it might be the work of some of Pelton's political enemies. About ten minutes ago, Major James F. Slater, of the Literates' Guards, arrived with two hundred of his men, to protect the Literates on duty at the store. They captured the entire twelfth floor, where we are, now, with the exception of the Ladies' Lingerie and Hosiery departments around one of the escalators to the lower floors; here the gang who started the riot, and who are now donning white hoods to distinguish themselves from the various other factions involved, have thrown up barricades of counters and display tables and are fighting bitterly to keep control of the escalator head. Ah, here we are!"  The screen lit suddenly, and they were looking, Ray over Yetsko's shoulder, across the devastated expanse of what had been the Ladies' Frocks department, toward Lingerie and Hosiery, which seemed to have been thoroughly looted, then stripped of everything that could be used to build a barricade.  "... Seems to have been quite a number of heavy 'copters just landed on the east stage, filled with more goons, probably to re-enforce the gang back of that barricade. The firing's gotten noticeably heavier--"         *       *       *       *       *  Yetsko had turned from the screen, and was pawing in the arms locker. For a job like this, he'd need firepower. He took the ten-shot clip from the butt of his pistol and inserted one with a curling hundred-shot drum at the bottom, and shoved two more like it into the pockets of his jacket. And now, something to clear the way with. He took out a three-foot length of weighted fire hose.  Then he saw Ray. That kid was pinning him down, here, while the captain was probably fighting for his life! But the captain'd told him to stay with Ray--He dropped the weighted hose.  "What's the matter, Doug?" the boy asked. "Pick it up and let's get going."  He shook his head. "Can't. The captain told me I had to take care of you."  The boy opened his mouth to speak, closed it again, and thought for a moment. Then he asked:  "Doug, didn't Captain Prestonby tell you to stay with me?"  "Yes--"  "All right. You do just that, because I'm going to help Claire and the senator. That's who that goon gang's after."  Yetsko considered the proposition for a moment, horrified. Why, this was the captain's girl's kid brother; if anything happened to him--His mind refused to contemplate what the captain would do to him.  "No. You gotta stay here, Ray," he said. "The captain--"  Then his eye caught the screen. Ed Morgan must have found a place where he could run his camera up on an extension rod from behind something; they were looking down, from almost ceiling height, at the barricade, and at the Literates' guards who were firing from cover at it. A sudden blast of automatic-weapons burst from the barricade; more men in white hoods came boiling up the escalator, and they all rushed forward. The few Literates' guards skirmishers were overwhelmed. He saw one of them, a man he knew, Sam Igoe, from Company 5, go down wounded; he saw one of the white-hooded goons pause to brain him with a carbine butt before charging on.  "Why, you dirty rotten Illiterate--!" he roared, retrieving his weighted hose. "Come on, Ray; let's go!"  Ray hesitated, as though in thought. "Ken Dorchin; Harry Cobb; Dick Hirschfield; Jerry McCarty; Ramon Nogales; Pete Shawne; Tom Hutchinson--"  "Who--?" Yetsko began. "What've they gotta do with--?"  "We need a gang; the two of us'd last about as long as a pint of beer at a Dutch picnic." Ray went to the desk, grabbed a pen, and made a list of names, in a fair imitation of Ralph Prestonby's neat block-printing. "Give this to the girl outside, and tell her to have them called for and sent in here," the boy directed. "And see if you can find us some transport. I think there ought to be a couple of big 'copters finished down at the shops. And if you can find a couple more Literates' guards you can talk into going with us--"  Yetsko nodded and took the paper without question. He was not, and he would be the first to admit it, of the thinking type. He was a good sergeant, but he had to have an officer to tell him what to do. Ray Pelton might be only fifteen years old, but his sister was the captain's girl, and that put him in the officer class. A very young and recently-commissioned second lieutenant, say, but definitely an officer. Yetsko took the list and looked at it. Like most Literates' guards, he could read, after a fashion. He recognized the names; the boys were all members of the top floor secret society. He went out and gave the list to Martha Collins.  He'd expected some argument with her, but she seemed to accept Ray Pelton's printing as Prestonby's; she began checking room charts and class lists, and calling for the boys to be sent at once to the office. He went out, and down to the 'copter repair shop, where he found that a big four-ton air truck that the senior class had been working on for several weeks was finished.  "That thing been tested, yet?" he asked the instructor.  "Yes; I had it up, myself, this morning. Flew it over to the Bronx and back with a load of supplies."  "O. K. Have somebody you can trust--one of your guards, preferably--bring it around behind the Administration Wing. Captain Prestonby wants it. I'm to take some boys from Fourth Year Civics on a tour. Something about election campaign methods."  The instructor called a Literates' guard and gave him instructions. Yetsko went to the guards' squad room on the second floor, where he found half a dozen of the reserves loafing.  "All right; you guys start earning your pay," he said. "We're going to a party."  The men got to their feet and began gathering their weapons.  "Mason," he continued, "you have your big 'copter here; the gang of you can all get in it. I'm taking off in a four-ton truck, with some of these kids. I want you boys to follow us. We're going to Pelton's store. There's a fight going on there, and the captain's in the middle of it. We gotta get him out."  They all looked at him in puzzled surprise, but nobody gave him any argument. Funny, now that he thought of it; it had been quite a long time since anybody had ever given him any argument about anything. A couple of guys out in Pittsburgh had tried it, but somehow they'd lost interest in arguing, after a little--  When he returned to the office and opened the door, a blast of shots greeted him through the open door of Prestonby's private office. He had his pistol out before he realized that the shooting was going on at Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise, ten miles away. Literate Martha Collins, in the inner room, was fairly screaming: "Shut that infernal thing off and listen to me!"  The dozen-odd boys whom Ray had recruited for the improvised relief-expedition were pulling weapons out of the gun locker, pawing through the boxes on the ammunition shelf, trying to explain to one another the working of machine carbines and burp guns. Yetsko shouldered through them and turned down the sound volume of the TV.  "This is absolutely outrageous!" Literate Martha Collins stormed at him. "You ought to be ashamed of yourself, taking these children to a murderous battle like that--"  "Well, maybe it ain't right, using savages in a civilized riot," Yetsko admitted, "but I don't care. The captain's in a jam, and I'd use live devils, if I could catch a few." He took a burp gun from one of the boys, who had opened the action and couldn't get it closed again. "Here; you kids don't want this kinda stuff," he reproved. "Sono guns, and sleep-gas guns, that's all right. But these things are killing tools!"  "It's what we'll have to use, Doug," Ray told him. "Things have been happening, since you went out. Look at the screen."  Yetsko looked, and swore blisteringly. Then he gave the burp gun back to the boy.  "Look; you gotta press this little gismo, here, to let the action shut when there's no clip in, or when the clip's empty. When you got a loaded clip in, you just pull back on this and let go--"         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Cardon looked at his watch, and saw that it was 1345, as it had been ten seconds before, when he had last looked. He started to drum nervously on his chair arm with his fingers, then caught himself as he saw Lancedale, who must have been every bit as anxious as himself, standing outwardly calm and unruffled.  "Well, that's the situation which now confronts us, brother Literates," the slender, white-haired man was finishing. "You must see, by now, that the policy of unyielding opposition which some of you have advocated and pursued is futile. You know the policy I favor, which now remains the only policy we can follow; it is summed up in that law of political strategy: If you can't lick 'em, join 'em, and, after joining, take control.  "In spite of the Radical-Socialist victory in this state at tomorrow's election, it will not be possible, in the next Congress, to enact Pelton's socialized Literacy program into law. The Radicals will not be able to capture enough seats in the lower house, and there are too many uncontested seats in the Senate now held by Independent-Conservatives. But, and this is inevitable, barring some unforeseen accident of the order of a political cataclysm, they will control both houses of Congress after the election of 2144, two years hence, and we can also be sure that two years hence Chester Pelton will be nominated and overwhelmingly elected president of the Consolidated States of North America. Six months thereafter, the socialized Literacy program will be the law of the land.  "So, we have until mid-2145 to make our preparations. I would estimate that, if we do not destroy ourselves by our own folly in the meantime, we should, two years thereafter, be in complete if secret control of the whole Consolidated States Government. If any of you question that last statement, you can merely ask yourselves one question: How, in the name of all that is rational, can Illiterates control and operate a system of socialized Literacy? Who but Literates can keep such a program from disintegrating into complete and indescribable confusion?  "I don't ask for any decision at this time. I do not ask for any debate at this time. Let each of us consider the situation in his or her own mind, and let us meet again a week from today to consider our future course of action, each of us realizing that any decision we take then will determine forever the fate of our Fraternities." He looked around the room. "Thank you, brother Literates," he said.  Instantly, Cardon was on his feet with a motion to recess the meeting until 1300 the following Monday, and Brigade commander Chernov seconded the motion immediately. As soon as Literate President Morehead's gavel banged, Cardon, still on his feet, was running for the double doors at the rear; the two Literates' guards on duty there got them unsealed and opened by the time he had reached them.  There was another guard in the hall, waiting for him with a little record-disk.  "From Major Slater; call came in about ten minutes ago," he said.  Cardon snapped the disk into his recorder-reproducer and put in the ear plug.  "Frank," Slater's voice came out of the small machine. "You'd better get busy, or you won't have any candidate when the polls open tomorrow. Just got a call from Pelton's store--place infiltrated by goons, estimated strength two hundred, presumed Independent-Conservatives. Serious rioting already going on; I'm taking my reserve company there. And if you haven't found out, yet, where China is, it's on the third floor, next to Glassware."  Cardon pulled out the ear plug, stuffed the recorder into his trouser pocket, and began unbuckling his Sam Browne as he ran for the nearest wall visiphone. He was dialing the guard room on that floor with one hand as he took off the belt.  "Get a big ambulance on the roof, with a Literate medic and orderly-driver," he ordered, unbuttoning his smock. "And four guards, plain clothes if possible, but don't waste time changing clothes if you don't have anybody out of uniform. Heavy-duty sono guns, sleep-gas projectors, gas masks and pistols. Hurry." He threw the smock and belt at the guard. "Here, Pancho; put these away for me. Thanks." He tossed the last word back over his shoulder as he ran for the escalator.  [Illustration:]  It was three eternal minutes after he had reached the landing stage above before the ambulance arrived, medic and orderly on the front seat and the four guards, all in conservatively cut civilian clothes, inside. He crowded in beside the medic, told him, "Pelton's store," and snapped the door shut as the big white 'copter began to rise.  They climbed to five thousand feet, and then the driver nosed his vehicle up, cut his propeller and retracted it, and fired his rocket, aiming toward downtown Manhattan. Four minutes later, after the rocket stopped firing and they were on the down-curve of their trajectory, the propeller was erected and they began letting down toward the central landing stage of Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise. Cardon cut in the TV and began calling the control tower.  "Ambulance, to evacuate Mr. Pelton," he called. "What's the score, down there?"  One of Pelton's traffic-control men appeared on Cardon's screen. "You're safe to land on the central stage, but you'd better come in at a long angle from the north," he said. "We control the north public stage, but the east and south stages are in the hands of the goons; they'd fire on you. Land beside that big pile of boxes under tarpaulins up here, but be careful; it's fireworks we didn't have time to get into storage."  The ambulance came slanting in from uptown, and Cardon looked around anxiously. The May-fly dance of customers' 'copters had stopped; there was a Sabbath stillness about the big store, at least visually. A few small figures in Literates' guards black leather moved about on the north landing stage, and several Pelton employees were on the central stop stage. The howling of the 'copter propeller overhead effectively blocked out any sounds that might be coming from the building, at least until the ambulance landed. Then a spatter of firing from below was audible.  Cardon, the medic and the guards piled out, the latter with the stretcher. The orderly-driver got out his tablet pistol and checked the chamber, then settled into a posture of watchful relaxation. Major Slater was waiting for them by one of the vertical lift platforms.  "I tried to get hold of you, but that blasted meeting was going on, and they had the doors sealed, and--" he began.  Cardon hushed him quickly. "Around here, I'm an Illiterate," he warned. "Where's Pelton? We've got to get him and his daughter out of here, at once."  "He's still flat on his back, out cold," Slater said. "The medic you sent around here gave him a shot of hypnotaine: he'll be out for a couple of hours, yet. Prestonby's still here. He's commanding the defense; doing a good job, too."  That was good. Ralph would help get Claire to Literates' Hall, after they'd gotten her father to safety.  "There must be about five hundred Independent-Conservative storm troopers in the store," Slater was saying. "Most of them got here after we did. The city cops have all the street approaches roped off; they're letting nobody but Grant Hamilton's thugs in."  "They were fairly friendly this morning," Cardon said. "Mayor Jameson must have passed the word." They all got off the lift two floors down, where they found Claire Pelton and Ralph Prestonby waiting. "Hello, Ralph. Claire. What's the situation?"  "We have all the twelfth floor," Prestonby said. "We have about half the eleventh, including the north and west public stages. We have the basement and the storerooms and the warehouse--Sergeant Coccozello's down there, with as many of the store police and Literates and Literates' guards and store-help as he could salvage, and the warehouse gang. They've taken most of the ground floor, the main mezzanine, and parts of the second floor. We moved two of the 7-mm machine guns down from the top, and we control the front street entrance with them and a couple of sono guns. The store's isolated from the outside by the city police, who are allowing re-enforcements to come through for the raiders, but we're managing to stop them at the doors."  "Have you called Radical-Socialist headquarters for help?"  "Yes, half a dozen times. There's some fellow named Yingling there, who says that all their storm troops are over in North Jersey, on some kind of a false-alarm riot-call, and can't be contacted."  "So?" Cardon commented gently. "That's too bad, now." Too bad for Horace Yingling and Joe West; this time tomorrow, they'll be a pair of dead traitors, he thought. "Well, we'll have to make do with what we have. Where's Russ Latterman, by the way?"  Prestonby gave a sidewise glance toward Claire and shook his head, his lips pressed tightly together. _She doesn't know, yet_, Cardon interpreted.  "Down in the basement, with Coccozello," Prestonby said, aloud. "We're in telephone communication with Coccozello, and have a freight elevator running between here and the basement. Coccozello says Latterman is using a rifle against the raiders, killing every one he can get a shot at."  Cardon nodded. Probably vindictive about being involved in action injurious to Pelton's commercial interests; just another odd quirk of Literate ethics.  "We'd better get him up here," he said. "You and I have got to leave, at once; we have to get Pelton and Claire to safety. He can help Major Slater till we can get back with re-enforcements. I am going to kill a man named Horace Yingling, and then I'm going to round up the storm troops he diverted on a wild-goose chase to North Jersey." He nodded to the medic and the four plain-clothes guards. "Get Pelton on the stretcher. Better use the canvas flaps and the straps. He's under hypnotaine, but it's likely to be a rough trip. Claire, get anything you want to take with you. Ralph will take you where you'll be safe for a while."  "But the store--" Claire began.  "Your father has riot-insurance, doesn't he? I know he does; they doubled the premium on him when he came out for Senate. Let the insurance company worry about the store."  The medic and the guards moved into Chester Pelton's private rest room with the stretcher. Claire went to the desk and began picking up odds and ends, including the pistol Cardon had given her, and putting them in her handbag.  "We've got to keep her away from her father, for a few days, Ralph," he told Prestonby softly. "It's all over town that she can read and write. We've got to give him a chance to cool off before he sees her again. Take her to Lancedale. I have everything fixed up; she'll be admitted to the Fraternities this afternoon, and given Literate protection."  Prestonby grabbed his hand impulsively. "Frank! I'll never be able to repay you for this, not if I live to be a thousand--" he began.  There was a sudden blast of sound from overhead--the banging of machine guns, the bark of the store's 20-mm auto-cannon, the howling of airplane jets, and the crash of explosions. Everybody in the room jerked up and stood frozen, then Prestonby jumped for the TV-screen and pawed at the dials. A moment later, after the screen flashed and went black twice, they were looking across the topside landing stage from a pickup at one corner.  A slim fighter-bomber, with square-tipped, backswept, wings, was jetting up in almost perpendicular flight; another was coming in toward the landing stage, and, as they watched, a flight of rockets leaped forward from under its wings. Cardon saw the orderly-driver of the ambulance jump down and start to run for the open lift-shaft. He got five steps away from his vehicle. Then the rockets came in, and one of them struck the tarpaulin-covered pile of boxes beside the ambulance. There was a flash of multicolored flame, in which the man and the vehicle he had left both vanished. Immediately, the screen went black.  The fireworks had mostly exploded at the first blast; however, when Cardon and Major Slater and one or two others reached the top landing stage, there were still explosions. A thing the size and shape of a two-gallon kettle, covered with red paper, came rolling toward them, and suddenly let go with a blue-green flash, throwing a column of smoke, in miniature imitation of an A-bomb, into the air. Something about three feet long came whizzing at them on the end of a tail of fire, causing them to fling themselves flat; involuntarily, Cardon's head jerked about and his eyes followed it until it blew up with a flash and a bang three blocks uptown. Here and there, colored fire flared, small rockets flew about, and firecrackers popped.  The ambulance was gone, blown clear off the roof. The other 'copters on the landing stage were a tangled mass of wreckage. The 20-mm was toppled over; the gunner was dead, and one of the crew, half-dazed, was trying to drag a third man from under the overturned gun. The control tower, with the two 12-mm machine guns, was wrecked. The two 7-mm's that had been left on the top had vanished, along with the machine gunners, in a hole that had been blown in the landing stage.  Cardon, Slater, and the others dashed forward and pulled the auto-cannon off the injured man, hauling him and his companion over to the lift. The two rakish-winged fighter-bombers were returning, spraying the roof with machine-gun bullets, and behind them came a procession of fifteen big 'copters. They dropped the lift hastily; Slater jumped off when it was still six feet above the floor, and began shouting orders.  "Falk: take ten men and get to the head of this lift-shaft! Burdick, Levine: get as many men as you can in thirty seconds, and get up to the head of the escalator! Diaz: go down and tell Sternberg to bring all his gang up here!"  Cardon caught up a rifle and rummaged for a bandolier of ammunition, losing about a minute in the search. The delay was fortunate; when he got to the escalators, he was met by a rush of men hurrying down the ascending spiral or jumping over onto the descending one.  "Sono guns!" one of them was shouting. "They have the escalator head covered; you'll get knocked out before you get off the spiral!"  He turned and looked toward the freight lift. It was coming down again, with Falk and his men unconscious on it, knocked senseless by bludgeons of inaudible sound, and a half a dozen of the 'copter-borne raiders, all wearing the white robes and hoods of the Independent-Conservative storm troops. He swung his rifle up and began squeezing the trigger, remembering to first make sure that the fire-control lever was set forward for semiauto, and remembering his advice to Goodkin, that morning. By the time the platform had stopped, all the men in white robes were either dead or wounded, and none of the unconscious Literates' guards along with them had been injured. The medic who had come with Cardon, assisted by a couple of the office force, got the casualties sorted out. There was nothing that could be done about the men who had been sono-stunned; in half an hour or so, they would recover consciousness with no ill effects that a couple of headache tablets wouldn't set right.  The situation, while bad, was not immediately desperate. If the white-clad raiders controlled the top landing stage, they were pinned down by the firearms and sono guns of the defenders, below, who were in a position to stop anything that came down the escalators or the lift shaft. The fate of the first party was proof of that. And the very magnitude of the riot guaranteed that somebody on the outside, city police, State guards, or even Consolidated States regulars, would be taking a hand shortly. The air attack and 'copter-landing on the roof had been excellent tactics, but it had been a serious policy-blunder. As long as the disturbance had been confined to the interior of the store, the city police could shrug it off as another minor riot on property supposed to be protected by private police, and do nothing about it. The rocket-attack on the top landing stage and the spectacular explosion of the fireworks temporarily stored there, however, was something that simply couldn't be concealed or dismissed. The cloud of varicolored smoke alone must have been visible all over the five original boroughs of the older New York, and there were probably rumors of atom-bombing going around.  "What gets me," Slater, who must have been thinking about the same thing, said to Cardon, "is where they got hold of those two fighter-bombers. That kind of stuff isn't supposed to be in private hands."  "A couple of hundred years ago, they had something they called the Sullivan Law," Cardon told him. "Private citizens weren't even allowed to own pistols. But the gangsters and hoodlums seemed to be able to get hold of all the pistols they wanted, and burp guns, too. I know of four or five racket gangs in this area that have aircraft like that, based up in the Adirondacks, at secret fields. Anybody who has connections with one of those gangs can order an air attack like this on an hour's notice, if he's able to pay for it. What I can't understand is the Independent-Conservatives doing anything like this. The facts about this business will be all over the state before the polls open tomorrow--" He snapped his fingers suddenly. "Come on; let's have a look at those fellows who came down on the lift!"  There were two dead men in white Independent-Conservative robes and hoods, lying where they had been dragged from the lift platform. Cardon pulled off the hoods and zipped open the white robes. One of the men was a complete stranger; the other, however, was a man he had seen, earlier in the day, at the Manhattan headquarters of the Radical-Socialist Party. One of the Consolidated Illiterates' Organization people; a follower of West and Yingling.  "So that's how it was!" he said, straightening. "Now I get it! Let's go see if any of those wounded goons are in condition to be questioned."         *       *       *       *       *  Ray Pelton and Doug Yetsko had their heads out an open window on the right side of the cab of the 'copter truck; Ray was pointing down.  "That roof, over there, looks like a good place to land," he said. "We can get down the fire escape, and the hatch to the conveyor belt is only half a block away."  Yetsko nodded. There'd be a watchman, or a private cop, in the building on which Ray intended landing. A couple of hundred dollars would take care of him, and they could leave two of Mason's boys with the vehicles to see that he stayed bribed.  "Sure we can get in on the freight conveyor?" he asked. "Maybe it'll be guarded."  "Then we'll have to crawl in through the cable conduit," Ray said. "I've done that, lots of times; so have most of the other guys." He nodded toward the body of the truck, behind, where his dozen-odd 'teen-age recruits were riding. "I've played all over the store, ever since I've been big enough to walk; I must know more about it than anybody but the guy who built it. That's why I said we'd have to bring bullet guns; down where we're going, we'd gas ourselves with gas guns, and if we used sono guns, we'd knock ourselves out with the echo."  "You know, Ray, you'll make a real storm trooper," Yetsko said. "If you manage to stay alive for another ten years, you'll be almost as good a storm troop captain as Captain Prestonby."  That, Ray knew, was about as high praise as Doug Yetsko could give anybody. He'd have liked to ask Doug more about Captain Prestonby--Doug could never seem to get used to the idea of his officer being a schoolteacher--but there was no time. The 'copter truck was already settling onto the roof.  The watchman proved amenable to reason. He took one look at Yetsko, with three feet of weighted fire hose in his hand, and gulped, then accepted the two C-notes Yetsko gave him. They left a couple of Literates' guards with the vehicles, and Ray led the way to the fire escape, and down into the alley. A few hundred feet away, there was an iron grating which they pulled up. Ray drew the pistol he had gotten out of Captain Prestonby's arms locker and checked the magazine, chamber, and safety, knowing that Yetsko and the other guards were watching him critically, and then started climbing down the ladder.  The conduit was halfway down. Yetsko, climbing behind him, examined it with his flashlight, probably wondering how he was going to fit himself into a hole like that. They climbed down onto the concrete walkway beside the conveyor belts, and in the dim light of the overhead lamps Ray could see that the two broad belts, to and from the store, were empty for as far as he could see in either direction. Normally, there should be things moving constantly in both directions--big wire baskets full of parcels for delivery, and trash containers, going out, and bales and crates and cases of merchandise, and empty delivery baskets and trash containers coming in. He pointed this out to Yetsko.  "Sure," the big Literates' guards sergeant nodded. "They got control of the opening from the terminal, and they probably got a gang up at the other end, too," he shouted, over the noise of the conveyor belts. "I hope they haven't got into the basement of the store."  "If they have, I know a way to get in," Ray told him. "You'd better stay here for about five minutes, and let me scout ahead. We don't want to run into a big gang of them ahead."  Yetsko shook his head. "No, Ray; the captain told me I was to stick with you. I'll go along with you. And we better take another of these kids, for a runner, in case we have to send word back."  "Ramon, you come with us," Ray said. "The rest of you, stay here for five minutes, and then, if you don't hear from us, follow us."  "Mason, you take over," Yetsko told the guards corporal. "And keep an eye out behind you. We're in a sandwich, here; they're behind us, and in front of us. If anything comes at you from behind, send the kids forward to the next conduit port."  Ray and Yetsko and Ramon Nogales started forward. Halfway to the next conduit port, there was a smear of lubricating oil on the concrete, and in it, and away from it in the direction of the store, they found footprints. It was Ramon Nogales who noticed the oil on the ladder to the next conduit port.  "You stick here," Yetsko told him, "and when Mason and the others come up, hold them here. Tell Mason to send one of the guards forward, and use the rest of the gang to grab anybody who comes out. Come on, Ray."  At the port beyond, they halted, waiting for Mason's man to come up. They lost some time, thereafter, but they learned that the section of conduit between the two ports was empty and that the main telephone line to the store had been cut. Whoever had cut it had gone, either forward or back away from the store. A little farther on, the sound of shots ahead became audible over the clanking and rattling of the conveyor belts.  "Well, I guess this is where we start crawling," Yetsko said. "Your father's people seem to be holding the store basement against a gang in the conveyor tunnel."  One of the boys scouted ahead, and returned to report that they could reach the next conduit port, but that the section of both conveyor belts ahead of him was stopped, apparently wedged.  Yetsko stood for a moment, grimacing in an effort to reach a decision.  "I'd like to just go forward and hit them from behind," he said. "But I don't know how many of them there are, and we'd have to be careful, shooting into them, that we didn't shoot up your father's gang, beyond them. I wish--"  "Well, let's go through the conduit, then," Ray said. "We can slide down a branch conduit that runs a power line into the basement. I'll go ahead; everybody at the store knows me, and they don't know you. They might shoot you before they found out you were a friend."  Before Yetsko could object, he started up the ladder, Yetsko behind him and the others following. At the next conduit port, they could hear shooting very plainly, seeming to be in front of them. At the next one, the shooting seemed to be going on directly under them, in the tunnel. With the flashlight Yetsko had passed forward to him, Ray could see that the dust on the concrete floor of the three-foot by three-foot passage between and under the power and telephone cables was undisturbed.  A little farther on, there was an opening on the left, and a power cable branched off downward, at a sharp angle, overhead. Ray was able to turn about and get his feet in front of him; Yetsko had to crawl on until he had passed it, and then back into it after Ray had entered. Bracing one foot on either side, Ray inched his way down the forty-degree slope, hoping that the two hundred pound weight of Doug Yetsko wouldn't start sliding upon him.  Ahead, he could hear voices. He drew his hands and feet away from the sides of the branch conduit and let himself slip, landing in a heap in the electricians' shop, above the furnace rooms. Two men, who had been working at a bench, trying to assemble a mass of equipment into a radio, whirled, snatching weapons. Ray knew both of them--Sam Jacobowitz and George Nyman, who serviced the store's communications equipment. They both stared at him, swearing in amazement.  "All right, Doug!" Ray called out. "We're in! Bring the gang down!"         *       *       *       *       *  Frank Cardon and Ralph Prestonby were waiting at the freight-elevator door when it opened and Russell Latterman emerged, a rifle slung over one shoulder. Cardon stepped forward and took the rifle from him.  "Come on over here, Russ," he said. "And don't do anything reckless."  They led him to one side. Latterman looked from one to the other apprehensively, licking his lips.  "It's all right; we're not going to hurt you, Russ," Cardon assured him. "We just want a few facts. Beside rigging that business with Bayne, and almost killing Chet Pelton, and forcing Claire to blow her cover, how much did you have to do with this business?"  "And who put you up to it?" Prestonby wanted to know. "My guess is Joyner and Graves. Am I right?"  "Graves," Latterman said. "Joyner didn't have anything to do with it; didn't know anything about it. He's in charge of the Retail Merchandising section, and any action like this would be unethical, since Pelton's is a client of the Retail Merchandising section. All Graves told me to do was fix up a situation, using my own judgment, that would provoke a Literate strike and force either Claire or Frank here to betray Literacy. But I had no idea that it would involve a riot like this. If I had, I'd have stood on Literates' ethics and refused to have any part in it."  "That's about how I thought it would be," Cardon nodded. "Graves probably was informed by Literates with the Independent-Conservatives that this riot was planned; he wanted to get our people out of the store. Unfortunately for him, he wasn't present at the extemporary meeting that reversed Bayne's action in calling the strike." He handed the rifle back to Latterman. "I just took this in case you might get excited, before I could explain. And you can forget about the Graves-Joyner opposition to Pelton. We had a meeting, right after noon. Lancedale gained the upper hand; Joyner and Graves are co-operating, now; the plan is to support Pelton and get on the inside of the socialized Literacy program, when it's enacted."  "I still think that's a suicidal policy," Latterman said. "But not as suicidal as splitting the Fraternities and trying to follow two policies simultaneously. I wonder if I could put a call through to Literates' Hall without some of these picture-readers overhearing me."  "You've been out of touch, down in the cellar, Russ." Prestonby told him. "Our telephone line's cut, and the radio is smashed." He told Latterman about the rocket attack on the control tower, which also housed the store's telecast station. "So we're sandwiched, here; one gang has us blocked at the twelfth floor, and another gang's up on the roof, trying to get down at us from above, and we've no way to communicate with the outside. We can pick up the regular telecasts, but nobody outside seems to be paying much attention to us."  "There's a lot of equipment down in the electricians' shop," Latterman said. "Maybe we could rig up a sending set that could contact one of the telecast stations outside."  "That's an idea," Prestonby said. "Let's see what we can do about it."  They went into Pelton's office. The store owner was still lying motionless on his stretcher. Claire was fiddling with a telecast receiving set; she had just tuned out a lecture on Home Beautifications and had gotten the mid-section of a serial in which three couples were somewhat confused over just who was married to whom.  "Nobody seems to realize what's happening to us!" she said, turning the knob again. Then she froze, as Elliot C. Mongery--this time sponsored by Parc, the Miracle Cleanser--appeared on the screen.  "... And it seems that the attack on Chester Pelton has picked up new complications; somebody seems determined to wipe out the whole Pelton family, because, only ten minutes ago, some twenty armed men invaded the Mineola High School, where Pelton's fifteen-year-old son, Raymond, is a student, and forced their way to the office of Literate First Class Ralph N. Prestonby, in an attempt to kidnap young Pelton. Neither Literate Prestonby, the principal, nor the Pelton boy, who was supposed to be in his office, could be found. The raiders were put to flight by the presence of mind of Literate Martha B. Collins, who pressed the button which turned in the fire alarm, filling the halls with a mob of students. The interlopers fled in panic after being set upon and almost mobbed--"  Prestonby looked worried. "I left Ray in my office, with Doug Yetsko," he said. "I can't understand--"  [Illustration:]  "Maybe Yetsko got a tip that they were coming and got Ray out of the school," Cardon suggested. "I hope he took him home." He caught himself just in time to avoid mentioning the platoon of Literates' guards at the Pelton home, which he was not supposed to know about. "Don't worry, Claire; if anything'd happened to Ray, Mongery'd have been screaming about it to high heaven. That's what he's paid to do."  "Well, I'll stake my life on it; if anybody tried to do anything to Ray while Yetsko was with him, you'd have heard about it," Prestonby said. "It'd have been a bigger battle than this one."  "... Can't seem to find out anything about what's going on at Pelton's store," Mongery continued. "Telephone and radio communication seems to be broken, and, although there is continuous firing going on inside the building, the city police, who have a cordon completely around it, say that the situation in the store is well in hand. Considering Chester Pelton's attacks on the city administration and particularly the police department, I leave to your imagination what they mean by that. We do know that a large body of unidentified plug-uglies whom Police Inspector Cassidy claims are 'special officers' are holding the conveyor line into the store at the downtown Manhattan terminal, and nobody seems to know what's going on at the other end--"  "They have the sections of both belts at the store entrance end wedged," Latterman said, coming up at the moment. "Coccozello has a barricade thrown up across the store end of the tunnel, and they have a barricade about fifty yards down the tunnel. That's where I was fighting when you called me up."  "Anything being done about gold-berging up a radio sending-set?" Prestonby asked.  "Yes. I just called Coccozello," Latterman said. "Fortunately, the inter-department telephone is still working. He's put a couple of men to work, and thinks he may have a set in operation in about half an hour."  "... And if, as I much fear, Chester Pelton has been murdered, then I advise all listening to me to go to the polls tomorrow and vote the straight Anarchist ticket. If we've got to have anarchy in this country, let's have anarchy for all, and not just for Grant Hamilton and his political adherents!" Mongery was saying.         *       *       *       *       *  There was a series of heavy explosions on the floor above. Everybody grabbed weapons and hurried outside, crowding onto the escalators. The floor above was a shambles, with bodies lying about, and the descending escalator was packed with white-robed attackers, who had apparently prepared for their charge by tossing down a number of heavy fragmentation bombs. Cardon had a burp gun, this time; he emptied the fifty-shot magazine into the hooded hoodlums who were coming down. Prestonby, beside him, had a heavy sono gun; he kept it trained on the head of the escalator and held the trigger back until it was empty, then slapped in a fresh clip of the small blank cartridges which produced the sound waves that were amplified and altered to stunning vibrations. Still, many of the attackers got through. More were dropping down the lift-platform shaft. Cardon's submachine-gun ceased firing, the action open on an empty clip. He dropped it and yanked the heavy pistol from his shoulder holster. Then, from the direction of the freight elevator, reinforcements arrived, headed by a huge man in the black leather of the Literates' guard, who swung a three-foot length of fire hose with his right hand and fired a pistol with his left, and a boy in a black-and-red jacket who was letting off a burp gun in deliberate, parsimonious, bursts. It was a second or two before Cardon recognized them as Prestonby's bodyguard, Doug Yetsko, and Claire Pelton's brother Ray. There were four Literates' guards and about a dozen boys with them, all firing with a variety of weapons.  At the same time, others were arriving on the escalators from the floors below, firing as they came off--Slater's Literates' guards, the Literates and their black-jacketed troopers of Hopkinson's store service crew, the fifteen survivors of the twenty riflemen from Macy & Gimbel's. The attackers turned and crowded onto the ascending escalator. Most of them got away, the casualties being carried up by the escalator. Doug Yetsko bounded forward and brought his fire hose down on the back of one invader's neck. Then, after a last spatter of upward-aimed shots from the defenders, there was silence.  Cardon stepped forward and yanked the hood from the man whom Yetsko had knocked down, hoping that he had a stunned prisoner who could be interrogated. The man was dead, however, with a broken neck. For a moment, Cardon looked down at the heavy, brutal features of Joe West, the Illiterates' Organization man. If Chester Pelton got out of this mess alive and won the election tomorrow, there was going to have to be a purge in the Radical-Socialist party, and something was going to have to be done about the Consolidated Organization of Illiterates. He turned to Yetsko.  "You and your gang got here just in the nick of time," he said. "How did you get into the store?"  "Through the freight conveyor, into the basement."  "But I thought those goons had both ends of that plugged."  "They did," Yetsko grinned. "But Ray Pelton took us in at the middle, and we crawled through a cable conduit to get around the gang at this end."  Cardon looked around quickly, in search of Ray. The boy, having come out of the excitement of battle, was looking around at the litter of dead and wounded on the blood-splashed floor. His eyes widened, and he gulped. Then, carefully setting the safety of his burp gun and slinging it, he went over and leaned against the wall, and was sick.  Prestonby, with Claire Pelton beside him, started toward the white-faced, retching boy. Yetsko put out a hamlike hand to stop them.  "If the kid wants to be sick, let him be sick," he said. "He's got a right to. I was sicker'n that, after my first fight. But he won't do that the next time."  "There isn't going to be any next time!" Claire declared, with maternal protectiveness.  "That's what you think, Miss Claire," Yetsko told her. "That boy's gonna make a great storm trooper," he declared. "Every bit as great as Captain Prestonby, here."  Claire looked up at Prestonby almost worshipfully. "And I never knew anything about your being a fighting-man, till today," she said. "Ralph, there's so much about you that I don't know."  "There'll be plenty of time to find out, now, honey," he told her.  Cardon stepped over the body of Joe West and went up to them.  "Sorry to intrude on you two," he said, "but we've got to figure on how to get out of here. Could we get out the same way you got in?" he asked Yetsko. "And take Mr. Pelton with us?"  Yetsko frowned. "Part of the way, we gotta crawl through this conduit; it's only about a yard square. And we'd have to go up a ladder, and out a manhole, to get out of the conveyor tunnel. What sorta shape's Mr. Pelton in?"  "He's under hypnotaine, completely unconscious," Prestonby said.  "Then we'd have to drag him," Yetsko said. "Strap him up in a tarp, or load him into a sleeping bag, if we can get hold of one."  "There are plenty, down in the warehouse," Latterman interrupted, joining them. "And the warehouse is in our hands."  "All right," Cardon decided. "We'll take him out, now, and take him home. I have some men there who'll take care of him. We'll have to get you and Ray out, too," he told Claire. "I think we'll take both of you to Literates' Hall; you'll be absolutely safe there."  "But the store," Claire started to object. "And all these people who came here to help us--"  "As soon as I have your father home, I'm going to start rounding up a gang to raise the siege," Cardon said. "Radical-Socialist storm troops, and--" He grinned suddenly. "The insurance company; the one that has the store insured against riot! Why didn't I think of them before? They're losing money every second this thing goes on. It'll be worth their while to start doing something to stop it!"         *       *       *       *       *  The trip out through the conduit was not so difficult, even with the encumbrance of the unconscious Chester Pelton, but Prestonby was convinced that, except for the giant strength of Doug Yetsko, it would have been nearly impossible. Ray Pelton, recovered from his after-battle nausea and steeled by responsibility, went first. Cardon crawled after him, followed by a couple of the boys. Then came Yetsko, dragging the sleeping bag in which Chester Pelton was packed like a mummy. Prestonby himself followed, pushing on his future father-in-law's feet, and Claire crawled behind, with the rest of Ray's schoolmates for a rearguard.  They got past the battle which was still going on at the entrance to the store basement, letting Pelton down with a rope and carrying him onto the outward-bound belt. They left it in time to assemble under the ladder leading to the alley through which Ray said they had entered, and hauled Pelton up after them. Then, when they were all out in the open again, Ray ran up the alley and mounted a fire escape, and, in a few minutes, a big 'copter truck which had been parked on the roof let down to them. Into this, Cardon ordered the unconscious senatorial candidate loaded, and the boys who had come with Ray.  "I'll take him home, and then run the boys to the school," he told Prestonby. "You and Ray and Claire get in this other 'copter and go straight to Literates' Hall." He pointed up to the passenger vehicle which was hovering above, waiting for the truck to leave. "Go in the church way, and go straight to Lancedale's office. And here." He scribbled an address and a phone number and a couple of names. "These men have my 'copter at this address. Call them as soon as you get to Literates' Hall and have them take it at once to Pelton's home, on Long Island."  Prestonby nodded and watched Cardon climb into the truck. The Literates' guard who was driving lifted it up and began windmilling away toward the east. The passenger 'copter, driven by another guard from the school, settled down. Putting Ray and Claire into it, he climbed in after them.  "Ray," he said, "how would you like to be a real white-smock Literate?"  Ray's eyes opened. "You think I'm good enough?"  "Good enough to be a novice, to start with. And I don't think you'll stay a novice long."  Claire looked at him inquiringly, saying nothing.  "You, too, honey," he said. "Frank fixed it all up. You and Ray will be admitted to the Fraternities, this afternoon. And that will remove any objection to our being married."  "But ... how about the Senator?" she asked.  Prestonby shrugged. "It's all over the state now that you can read; there's nothing that you can do about it. And Frank has a lot of influence with him; he'll talk him around to where he'll be willing to make the best of it, in a week or so."         *       *       *       *       *  Russell Latterman noticed that Major Slater was looking at him in a respectfully inquiring manner. He said nothing, and, at length, the Literates' guards officer broke the silence.  "You didn't go out with the others."  Latterman shook his head. "No, major; I'm an executive of Pelton's Purchasers' Paradise, however unlike its name it may look at the moment. My job's here. I'm afraid I'll have to lean pretty heavily on you, until Mr. Cardon can get help to us. I'm not particularly used to combat."  "You've been doing all right with that rifle," Slater told him.  "I can hit what I aim at, yes. But I'm not used to commanding men in combat, and I'm not much of a tactician."  Slater thrust out his hand impulsively. "I took a sort of poor view of you, at first. I'm sorry," he said. "Want me to take command?"  "If you please, major."  "What are you going to do, after this thing's over?" Slater asked.  "Stay on with Pelton's, provided Mr. P. doesn't find out that I organized that trick with his medicine and the safe," Latterman said. "Since Lancedale seems to have gotten on top at the Hall, I am, as of now, a Lancedale partisan. That's partly opportunism, and it's partly because, since a single policy has been adopted, I feel obliged to go along with it. I'll have to get the store back in operation, as soon as possible. Pelton's going to need money, badly, if he's going to try for the presidency in '44." He looked around him. "You know, I've always wanted to run a fire sale; this'll be even better--a battle sale!"         *       *       *       *       *  Cardon watched Chester Pelton apprehensively as the bald-headed merchant and senatorial candidate sipped from the tall glass in his hand and then set it on the table beside him. His face was pale, and he had the look of a man who has just been hit with a blackjack.  "That's an awful load of bricks to dump on a man, all at once, Frank," he said reproachfully.  "You'd rather I told you, now, than turn on the TV and hear some commentator talking about it, wouldn't you?" Cardon asked.  Pelton swore vilely, in a lifeless monotone, cursing Literacy, and all Literates back to the invention of the alphabet. Then he stopped short.  "No, Frank, I don't mean that, either. My own son and daughter are Literates; I can't say that about them. But how long--?"  "Oh, for about a year, I'd say. I understand, now, that they were admitted to the Fraternities six months ago," he invented.  "And they were working against me, all that time?" Pelton demanded.  Cardon shook his head. "No, Chet; they were for you, all the way. Your daughter exposed her Literacy to save your life. Your son and his teacher came to your store and fought for you. But there are Literates who want to see you defeated, and they're the ones who made that audio-visual, secretly, of the ceremony in which your son and daughter took the Literates' Oath and received the white smock, and they're going to telecast it this evening at twenty-one hundred. Coming on top of the stories that have been going around all afternoon, and Slade Gardner's speech, this morning, they think that'll be enough to defeat you."  "Well, don't you?" Pelton gloomed. "My own kids, Literates!" He seemed to have reached a point at which he was actually getting a masochistic pleasure out of turning the dagger in his wounds. "Who'd trust me, after this?"  "No, Chet; it isn't enough to beat you--if you just throw away that crying towel and start fighting. They made one mistake that's going to wreck them."  "What's that, Frank?" Pelton brightened, by about one angstrom unit.  "The timing, of course!" Cardon told him, impatiently. "I thought you'd see that, at once. This telecast comes on at twenty-one hundred. Your final speech comes on at twenty-one thirty. As soon as they've shown this business of Claire and Ray taking the Literate Oath, you'll be on the air, yourself, and if you put on any kind of a show worth the name, it won't be safe for anybody in this state to be caught wearing a white smock. Now, if they'd only had the wit to wait till after you'd delivered that speech you've been practicing on for the last two weeks, and then spring this on you, that would have been different. They'd have had you over a barrel. But this way, you have them!"  Pelton took another gulp from the tall glass at his elbow, emptying it. "Fix me up another of these, Frank," he said. "I feel like a new man, already." Then his face clouded again. "But we have no time to prepare a speech, now, and I just can't ad lib one."  Cardon drew a little half-inch record-disk from his pocket case.  "Play this off," he said. "I had it fixed up, as soon as I got wise to what was going to happen. The voice is one of the girls in my office, over at the brewery. Pronunciation, grammar, elocution and everything correct."  Pelton snapped the disk onto his recorder and put in the ear plug. Then, before he pressed the stud, he looked at Cardon curiously.  "How'd you get onto this, anyhow, Frank?" he wanted to know.  "Well ... I hope you don't ask me for an accounting of all the money I've been spending in this campaign, because some of the items would look funny as hell, but--"  "No accounting, Frank. After all, you spent as much of your own money as you did of mine," Pelton interrupted.  "... But I bought myself a pipe line into Literates' Hall big enough to chase an elephant through," Cardon went on, ignoring the interruption. "This fellow Mongery, for instance." Elliot Mongery was one of Literate Frank Cardon's best friends; he comforted his conscience with the knowledge that Mongery would slander him just as unscrupulously, if the interests of the Lancedale Plan were at stake. "I have Mongery just like this." He made a clutching and lifting gesture, as though he were picking up some small animal by the scruff of the neck. "So, as soon as I got word of it, I started getting this thing together. It isn't the kind of a job a Literate semanticist would do, but it's all honest Illiterate thinking, in Illiterate language. Turn it on, and tell me what you think of it."  While Pelton listened to the record, Cardon mixed him another of the highballs, adding a little of the heart-stimulant the medic had given him. Pelton was grinning savagely when he turned off the little machine and took out the ear plug.  "Great stuff, Frank! And I won't have to ham it much; it's just about the way I feel." He thought for a moment. "You have me talking about my ruined store, there. Just how bad is it, anyhow?"  "Pretty bad, Chet. Latterman says it's going to take some time to get it fixed up, but he expects to be open for business by Thursday or Friday. He's going to put on a big Battle Sale; he says it's going to make retail-merchandising history. And the insurance covers most of the damage."  "Well, tell me about it. How did you get the riot stopped, after you got me out? And how did you--?"  Cardon shook his head. "You play that record over again; get yourself in the mood. When you go on, we'll have you in a chair, wrapped in a blanket ... you're supposed to have crawled back out of the Valley of the Shadow of Death to make this speech ... and we'll have the wire run down inside the blanket, so that you can listen to the speech while you're giving it. Chet, this is going to be one of the great political speeches of all time--"         *       *       *       *       *  Literate William R. Lancedale looked up from his desk and greeted his visitor with a smile.  "Well, Frank! Sit down and accept congratulations! I suppose you got the returns?"  Cardon nodded, dropping into a chair beside the desk. "Just came from campaign headquarters. This automatic tally system they use on the voting machines is really something. Complete returns tabulated and reported for the whole state within forty minutes after the polls closed. I won't be silly enough to ask you if you got the returns."  "I deserved that, of course," Lancedale chuckled. "Can I offer you refreshment? A nice big stein of Cardon's Black Bottle, for instance?"  Cardon shuddered and grimaced horribly. "I've been drinking that slop by the bucketful, all day. And Pelton's throwing a victory party, tonight, and I'll have to choke down another half gallon of it. Give me a cup of coffee, and one of those good cigars of yours."  Lancedale grinned at him. "Ah, yes, the jolly brewer. His own best advertisement. How's Pelton reacting to his triumph? And what's his attitude toward his children? I've been worrying about that; vestigial traces of a conscience, I suppose."  "Well, I had to keep him steamed up, till after he went off the air," Cardon said. "Chet isn't a very good actor. But after that, I talked to him like a Dutch uncle. Told him what a swell pair of kids and a fine son-in-law he had. He got sore at me. Tried to throw me out of the house, a couple of times. I was afraid he was going to have another of those attacks. But by the time Ralph and Claire get back from their honeymoon and Ray finishes that cram-course for Literate prep school, he'll be ready to confer the paternal blessing all around. I'm going to stay in town and make sure of it, and then I'm taking about a month's vacation."  "You've earned it, all right." Lancedale poured Cardon's coffee and passed him the cigar humidor. "How's Pelton's attitude toward the Consolidated Illiterates' Organization, now?"  Cardon, having picked up the Italian stiletto to puncture his cigar, looked at it carefully to make sure that it really had no edge, and then drew it quickly across his throat.  "Just like that. You know what really happened, yesterday afternoon, at the store, don't you?"  "Well, in general, yes. I wish you'd fill me in on some of the details, though, Frank."  "Details he wants. Well." Cardon blew on his coffee and sipped it. "The way we played it for propaganda purposes, of course, there was only one big riot, and it was all the work of the wicked Literates and their Independent-Conservative hirelings. Actually, there were two riots. First, there was one the Independents had planned for about a week in advance; that was the one Sforza tipped us on, the one that started in China. Graves knew about it, enough to advise Latterman to get all the Literates out of the store before noon, which Latterman did, with trimmings.  "Then, there was another riot, masterminded by a couple of Illiterates' Organization Action Committee people named Joe West and Horace Yingling, both deceased. That was the result of Latterman's bright idea to trap Claire and/or me into betraying Literacy. These Illiterate fanatics made up their minds, to speak rather loosely, that the whole Pelton family were Literates, including Chet himself. They decided that it was better to kill off their candidate and use him for a martyr two years from now than to elect him and have him sell them out. They got about a hundred or so of their goons dressed in Independent-Conservative KKK costumes, bought air support from Patsy Callazo's mob, up in Vermont, and made that attack on the top landing stage, after starting a fake riot in North Jersey, to draw off the regular Radical-Socialist storm troops. Incidentally, when I found out it was Callazo's gang that furnished those fighter bombers, I hired another mob to go up and drop a block-buster on Callazo's field, to teach him to keep his schnozzle out of politics."  Lancedale nodded briskly. "That I approve of. How about West and Yingling?"  "Prestonby's muscle man, Yetsko, killed West. I took care of Comrade Yingling, myself, after I'd gotten reinforcements to the store--first a couple of free-lance storm troops that the insurance company hired, and then as many of the Radical Rangers as I could gather up."  "And Pelton knows about all this?"  "He certainly does! After this caper, the Illiterates' Organization's through, as far as any consideration or patronage from the Radicals is concerned."  "Well, that's pretty nearly the best thing I've heard out of the whole business," Lancedale said. "In about eight or ten years, we may want to pull the Independent-Conservative party together again, to cash in on public dissatisfaction with Pelton's socialized Literacy program, which ought to be coming apart at the seams by then. And if we have the Illiterates split into two hostile factions--"  Cardon finished his coffee. "Well, chief, I've got to be getting along. O'Reilly can only cover me for a short while, and I have to be getting to this victory party of Pelton's--"  Lancedale rose and shook hands with him. "I can't tell you, too many times, what a fine job you did, Frank," he said. "I hope ... no, knowing you, I'm positive ... that you'll be able to engineer a reconciliation between Pelton and his son and daughter and young Prestonby. And then, have yourself a good vacation."  "I mean to. I'm going deer hunting, to a place up in the mountains, along the old Pennsylvania-New York state line. A little community of about a thousand people, where everybody, men, women and children, can read."  Lancedale was interested. "A community of Literates?"  Cardon shook his head. "Not Literates-with-a-big-L; just people who can read and write," he replied. "It's a kind of back-eddy sort of place, and I imagine, a couple of hundred years ago, the community was too poor to support one of these 'progressive' school systems that made Illiterates out of the people in the cities. Probably couldn't raise enough money in school taxes to buy all the expensive audio-visual equipment, so they had to use old-fashioned textbooks, and teach the children to read from them. They have radios, and TV, of course, but they also have a little daily paper, and they have a community library."  Lancedale was thoughtful, for a moment. "You know, Frank, there must be quite a few little enclaves of lower-case-literacy like that, in back-woods and mountain communities, especially in the west and the south. I'm going to make a project of finding such communities, helping them, and getting recruits from them. They'll fit into the Plan. Well, I'll be seeing you some time tomorrow, I suppose?"  He watched Cardon go out, and then poured a glass of port for himself and sipped slowly, holding the glass to the light and watching the ruby glow it cast on the desk top. It had been over thirty years ago, when he had been old Jules de Chambord's assistant, that the Plan had been first conceived. De Chambord was dead these twenty years, and he had taken the old man's place, and they had only made the first step. Things would move faster, now, but he would still die before the Plan was completed, and Frank Cardon, whom he had marked as his successor, would be an old man, and somebody like young Ray Pelton would be ready to replace him, but the Plan would go on, until everybody would be literate, not Literate, and illiteracy, not Illiteracy, would be a mark of social stigma, and most people would live their whole lives without personal acquaintance with an illiterate.  There were a few years, yet, to prepare for the next step. The white smocks would have to go; Literates would have to sacrifice their paltry titles and distinctions. There would have to be a re-constitution of the Fraternities. Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves and the other Conservative Literates would have to be convinced, emotionally as well as intellectually, of the need for change. There were a few of the older brothers who could never adjust their thinking; they would have to be promoted to positions with higher salaries and more impressive titles and no authority whatever.  But that was all a matter of tactics; the younger men, like Frank Cardon and Elliot Mongery and Ralph Prestonby, could take care of that. Certain changes would occur: A stable and peaceful order of society, for one thing. A rule of law, and the liquidation of these goon gangs and storm troops and private armies. If a beginning at that were made tomorrow, using the battle at Pelton's store to mobilize public opinion, it would still take two decades to get anything really significant done. And a renaissance of technological and scientific progress--Today, the manufacturers changed the 'copter models twice a year--and, except for altering the shape of a few chromium-plated excrescences or changing the contours slightly, they were the same 'copters that had been buzzing over the country at the time of the Third World War. Every month, the pharmaceutical companies announced a new wonder drug--and if it wasn't sulfa, it was penicillin, and if it wasn't penicillin it would be aureomycin. Why, most of the scientific research was being carried on by a few Literates in the basements of a few libraries, re-discovering the science of two centuries ago.  He sighed, and finished his port, and, as he did probably once every six months, he re-filled the glass. He'd be seventy-two next birthday. Maybe he'd live long enough to see--   THE ENDHUNTER PATROL  By H. BEAM PIPER and JOHN J. McGUIRE       +Many men have dreamed of world peace, but none have been able to      achieve it. If one man did have that power, could mankind afford to      pay the price?+   At the crest of the ridge, Benson stopped for an instant, glancing first at his wrist-watch and then back over his shoulder. It was 0539; the barrage was due in eleven minutes, at the spot where he was now standing. Behind, on the long northeast slope, he could see the columns of black oil smoke rising from what had been the Pan-Soviet advance supply dump. There was a great deal of firing going on, back there; he wondered if the Commies had managed to corner a few of his men, after the patrol had accomplished its mission and scattered, or if a couple of Communist units were shooting each other up in mutual mistaken identity. The result would be about the same in either case--reserve units would be disorganized, and some men would have been pulled back from the front line. His dozen-odd UN regulars and Turkish partisans had done their best to simulate a paratroop attack in force. At least, his job was done; now to execute that classic infantry maneuver described as, "Let's get the hell outa here." This was his last patrol before rotation home. He didn't want anything unfortunate to happen.  There was a little ravine to the left; the stream which had cut it in the steep southern slope of the ridge would be dry at this time of year, and he could make better time, and find protection in it from any chance shots when the interdictory barrage started. He hurried toward it and followed it down to the valley that would lead toward the front--the thinly-held section of the Communist lines, and the UN lines beyond, where fresh troops were waiting to jump from their holes and begin the attack.  There was something wrong about this ravine, though. At first, it was only a vague presentiment, growing stronger as he followed the dry gully down to the valley below. Something he had smelled, or heard, or seen, without conscious recognition. Then, in the dry sand where the ravine debouched into the valley, he saw faint tank-tracks--only one pair. There was something wrong about the vines that mantled one side of the ravine, too....  An instant later, he was diving to the right, breaking his fall with the butt of his auto-carbine, rolling rapidly toward the cover of a rock, and as he did so, the thinking part of his mind recognized what was wrong. The tank-tracks had ended against the vine-grown side of the ravine, what he had smelled had been lubricating oil and petrol, and the leaves on some of the vines hung upside down.  Almost at once, from behind the vines, a tank's machine guns snarled at him, clipping the place where he had been standing, then shifting to rage against the sheltering rock. With a sudden motor-roar, the muzzle of a long tank-gun pushed out through the vines, and then the low body of a tank with a red star on the turret came rumbling out of the camouflaged bay. The machine guns kept him pinned behind the rock; the tank swerved ever so slightly so that its wide left tread was aimed directly at him, then picked up speed. Aren't even going to waste a shell on me, he thought.  Futilely, he let go a clip from his carbine, trying to hit one of the vision-slits; then rolled to one side, dropped out the clip, slapped in another. There was a shimmering blue mist around him. If he only hadn't used his last grenade, back there at the supply-dump....  The strange blue mist became a flickering radiance that ran through all the colors of the spectrum and became an utter, impenetrable blackness....         *       *       *       *       *  There were voices in the blackness, and a softness under him, but under his back, when he had been lying on his stomach, as though he were now on a comfortable bed. They got me alive, he thought; now comes the brainwashing!  He cracked one eye open imperceptibly. Lights, white and glaring, from a ceiling far above; walls as white as the lights. Without moving his head, he opened both eyes and shifted them from right to left. Vaguely, he could see people and, behind them, machines so simply designed that their functions were unguessable. He sat up and looked around groggily. The people, their costumes--definitely not Pan-Soviet uniforms--and the room and its machines, told him nothing. The hardness under his right hip was a welcome surprise; they hadn't taken his pistol from him! Feigning even more puzzlement and weakness, he clutched his knees with his elbows and leaned his head forward on them, trying to collect his thoughts.  "We shall have to give up, Gregory," a voice trembled with disappointment.  "Why, Anthony?" The new voice was deeper, more aggressive.  "Look. Another typical reaction; retreat to the foetus."  Footsteps approached. Another voice, discouragement heavily weighting each syllable: "You're right. He's like all the others. We'll have to send him back."  "And look for no more?" The voice he recognized as Anthony faltered between question and statement.  A babel of voices, in dispute; then, clearly, the voice Benson had come to label as Gregory, cut in:  "I will never give up!"  He raised his head; there was something in the timbre of that voice reminding him of his own feelings in the dark days when the UN had everywhere been reeling back under the Pan-Soviet hammer-blows.  "Anthony!" Gregory's voice again; Benson saw the speaker; short, stocky, gray-haired, stubborn lines about the mouth. The face of a man chasing an illusive but not uncapturable dream.  "That means nothing." A tall thin man, too lean for the tunic-like garment he wore, was shaking his head.  Deliberately, trying to remember his college courses in psychology, he forced himself to accept, and to assess, what he saw as reality. He was on a small table, like an operating table; the whole place looked like a medical lab or a clinic. He was still in uniform; his boots had soiled the white sheets with the dust of Armenia. He had all his equipment, including his pistol and combat-knife; his carbine was gone, however. He could feel the weight of his helmet on his head. The room still rocked and swayed a little, but the faces of the people were coming into focus.         *       *       *       *       *  He counted them, saying each number to himself: one, two, three, four, five men; one woman. He swung his feet over the edge of the table, being careful that it would be between him and the others when he rose, and began inching his right hand toward his right hip, using his left hand, on his brow, to misdirect attention.  "I would classify his actions as arising from conscious effort at cortico-thalamic integration," the woman said, like an archaeologist who has just found a K-ration tin at the bottom of a neolithic kitchen-midden. She had the peculiarly young-old look of the spinster teachers with whom Benson had worked before going to the war.  "I want to believe it, but I'm afraid to," another man for whom Benson had no name-association said. He was portly, gray-haired, arrogant-faced; he wore a short black jacket with a jewelled zipper-pull, and striped trousers.  Benson cleared his throat. "Just who are you people?" he inquired. "And just where am I?"  Anthony grabbed Gregory's hand and pumped it frantically.  "I've dreamed of the day when I could say this!" he cried. "Congratulations, Gregory!"         *       *       *       *       *  That touched off another bedlam, of joy, this time, instead of despair. Benson hid his amusement at the facility with which all of them were discovering in one another the courage, vision and stamina of true patriots and pioneers. He let it go on for a few moments, hoping to glean some clue. Finally, he interrupted.  "I believe I asked a couple of questions," he said, using the voice he reserved for sergeants and second lieutenants. "I hate to break up this mutual admiration session, but I would appreciate some answers. This isn't anything like the situation I last remember...."  "He remembers!" Gregory exclaimed. "That confirms your first derivation by symbolic logic, and it strengthens the validity of the second...."  The schoolteacherish woman began jabbering excitedly; she ran through about a paragraph of what was pure gobbledegook to Benson, before the man with the arrogant face and the jewelled zipper-pull broke in on her.  "Save that for later, Paula," he barked. "I'd be very much interested in your theories about why memories are unimpaired when you time-jump forward and lost when you reverse the process, but let's stick to business. We have what we wanted; now let's use what we have."  "I never liked the way you made your money," a dark-faced, cadaverous man said, "but when you talk, it makes sense. Let's get on with it."  Benson used the brief silence which followed to study the six. With the exception of the two who had just spoken, there was the indefinable mark of the fanatic upon all of them--people fanatical about different things, united for different reasons in a single purpose. It reminded him sharply of some teachers' committee about to beard a school-board with an unpopular and expensive recommendation.  Anthony--the oldest of the lot, in a knee-length tunic--turned to Gregory.  "I believe you had better...." he began.  "As to who we are, we'll explain that, partially, later. As for your question, 'Where am I?' that will have to be rephrased. If you ask, 'When and where am I?' I can furnish a rational answer. In the temporal dimension, you are fifty years futureward of the day of your death; spatially, you are about eight thousand miles from the place of your death, in what is now the World Capitol, St. Louis."  Nothing in the answer made sense but the name of the city. Benson chuckled.  "What happened; the Cardinals conquer the world? I knew they had a good team, but I didn't think it was that good."  "No, no," Gregory told him earnestly. "The government isn't a theocracy. At least not yet. But if The Guide keeps on insisting that only beautiful things are good and that he is uniquely qualified to define beauty, watch his rule change into just that."  "I've been detecting symptoms of religious paranoia, messianic delusions, about his public statements...." the woman began.  "Idolatry!" another member of the group, who wore a black coat fastened to the neck, and white neck-bands, rasped. "Idolatry in deed, as well as in spirit!"         *       *       *       *       *  The sense of unreality, partially dispelled, began to return. Benson dropped to the floor and stood beside the table, getting a cigarette out of his pocket and lighting it.  "I made a joke," he said, putting his lighter away. "The fact that none of you got it has done more to prove that I am fifty years in the future than anything any of you could say." He went on to explain who the St. Louis Cardinals were.  "Yes; I remember! Baseball!" Anthony exclaimed. "There is no baseball, now. The Guide will not allow competitive sports; he says that they foster the spirit of violence...."  The cadaverous man in the blue jacket turned to the man in the black garment of similar cut.  "You probably know more history than any of us," he said, getting a cigar out of his pocket and lighting it. He lighted it by rubbing the end on the sole of his shoe. "Suppose you tell him what the score is." He turned to Benson. "You can rely on his dates and happenings; his interpretation's strictly capitalist, of course," he said.  Black-jacket shook his head. "You first, Gregory," he said. "Tell him how he got here, and then I'll tell him why."  "I believe," Gregory began, "that in your period, fiction writers made some use of the subject of time-travel. It was not, however, given serious consideration, largely because of certain alleged paradoxes involved, and because of an elementalistic and objectifying attitude toward the whole subject of time. I won't go into the mathematics and symbolic logic involved, but we have disposed of the objections; more, we have succeeded in constructing a time-machine, if you want to call it that. We prefer to call it a temporal-spatial displacement field generator."  "It's really very simple," the woman called Paula interrupted. "If the universe is expanding, time is a widening spiral; if contracting, a diminishing spiral; if static, a uniform spiral. The possibility of pulsation was our only worry...."  "That's no worry," Gregory reproved her. "I showed you that the rate was too slow to have an effect on...."  "Oh, nonsense; you can measure something which exists within a microsecond, but where is the instrument to measure a temporal pulsation that may require years...? You haven't come to that yet."  "Be quiet, both of you!" the man with the black coat and the white bands commanded. "While you argue about vanities, thousands are being converted to the godlessness of The Guide, and other thousands of his dupes are dying, unprepared to face their Maker!"  "All right, you invented a time-machine," Benson said. "In civvies, I was only a high school chemistry teacher. I can tell a class of juniors the difference between H_{2}O and H_{2}SO_{4}, but the theory of time-travel is wasted on me.... Suppose you just let me ask the questions; then I'll be sure of finding out what I don't know. For instance, who won the war I was fighting in, before you grabbed me and brought me here? The Commies?"  "No, the United Nations," Anthony told him. "At least, they were the least exhausted when both sides decided to quit."  "Then what's this dictatorship.... The Guide? Extreme Rightist?"  "Walter, you'd better tell him," Gregory said.         *       *       *       *       *  "We damn near lost the war," the man in the black jacket and striped trousers said, "but for once, we won the peace. The Soviet Bloc was broken up--India, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Russia, the Ukraine, all the Satellite States. Most of them turned into little dictatorships, like the Latin American countries after the liberation from Spain, but they were personal, non-ideological, generally benevolent, dictatorships, the kind that can grow into democracies, if they're given time."  "Capitalistic dictatorships, he means," the cadaverous man in the blue jacket explained.  "Be quiet, Carl," Anthony told him. "Let's not confuse this with any class-struggle stuff."  "Actually, the United Nations rules the world," Walter continued. "What goes on in the Ukraine or Latvia or Manchuria is about analogous to what went on under the old United States government in, let's say, Tammany-ruled New York. But here's the catch. The UN is ruled absolutely by one man."  "How could that happen? In my time, the UN had its functions so subdivided and compartmented that it couldn't even run a war properly. Our army commanders were making war by systematic disobedience."  "The charter was changed shortly after ... er, that is, after...." Walter was fumbling for words.  "After my death." Benson finished politely. "Go on. Even with a changed charter, how did one man get all the powers into his hands?"  "By sorcery!" black-coat-and-white-bands fairly shouted. "By the help of his master, Satan!"  "You know, there are times when some such theory tempts me," Paula said.  "He was a big moneybags," Carl said. "He bribed his way in. See, New York was bombed flat. Where the old UN buildings were, it's still hot. So The Guide donated a big tract of land outside St. Louis, built these buildings--we're in the basement of one of them, right now, if you want a good laugh--and before long, he had the whole organization eating out of his hand. They just voted him into power, and the world into slavery."  Benson looked around at the others, who were nodding in varying degrees of agreement.  "Substantially, that's it. He managed to convince everybody of his altruism, integrity and wisdom," Walter said. "It was almost blasphemous to say anything against him. I really don't understand how it happened...."  "Well, what's he been doing with his power?" Benson asked. "Wise things, or stupid ones?"  "I could be general, and say that he has deprived all of us of our political and other liberties. It is best to be specific," Anthony said. "Gregory?"  "My own field--dimensional physics--hasn't been interfered with much, yet. It's different in other fields. For instance, all research in sonics has been arbitrarily stopped. So has a great deal of work in organic and synthetic chemistry. Psychology is a madhouse of ... what was the old word, licentiousness? No, lysenkoism. Medicine and surgery--well, there's a huge program of compulsory sterilization, and another one of eugenic marriage-control. And infants who don't conform to certain physical standards don't survive. Neither do people who have disfiguring accidents beyond the power of plastic surgery."         *       *       *       *       *  Paula spoke next. "My field is child welfare. Well, I'm going to show you an audio-visual of an interesting ceremony in a Hindu village, derived from the ancient custom of the suttee. It is the Hindu method of conforming to The Guide's demand that only beautiful children be allowed to grow to maturity."  The film was mercifully brief. Even in spite of the drums and gongs, and the chanting of the crowd, Benson found out how loudly a newborn infant can scream in a fire. The others looked as though they were going to be sick; he doubted if he looked much better.  "Of course, we are a more practical and mechanical-minded people, here and in Europe," Paula added, holding down her gorge by main strength. "We have lethal-gas chambers that even Hitler would have envied."  "I am a musician," Anthony said. "A composer. If Gregory thinks that the sciences are controlled, he should try to write even the simplest piece of music. The extent of censorship and control over all the arts, and especially music, is incredible." He coughed slightly. "And I have another motive, a more selfish one. I am approaching the compulsory retirement age; I will soon be invited to go to one of the Havens. Even though these Havens are located in the most barren places, they are beauty-spots, verdant beyond belief. It is of only passing interest that, while large numbers of the aged go there yearly, their populations remain constant, and, to judge from the quantities of supplies shipped to them, extremely small."         *       *       *       *       *  "They call me Samuel, in this organization," the man in the long black coat said. "Whoever gave me that alias must have chosen it because I am here in an effort to live up to it. Although I am ordained by no church, I fight for all of them. The plain fact is that this man we call The Guide is really the Antichrist!"  "Well, I haven't quite so lofty a motive, but it's good enough to make me willing to finance this project," Walter said. "It's very simple. The Guide won't let people make money, and if they do, he taxes it away from them. And he has laws to prohibit inheritance; what little you can accumulate, you can't pass on to your children."  "I put up a lot of the money, too, don't forget," Carl told him. "Or the Union did; I'm a poor man, myself." He was smoking an excellent cigar, for a poor man, and his clothes could have come from the same tailor as Walter's. "Look, we got a real Union--the Union of all unions. Every working man in North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa belongs to it. And The Guide has us all hog-tied."  "He won't let you strike," Benson chuckled.  "That's right. And what can we do? Why, we can't even make our closed-shop contracts stick. And as far as getting anything like a pay-raise...."  "Good thing. Another pay-raise in some of my companies would bankrupt them, the way The Guide has us under his thumb...." Walter began, but he was cut off.  "Well! It seems as though this Guide has done some good, if he's made you two realize that you're both on the same side, and that what hurts one hurts both," Benson said. "When I shipped out for Turkey in '77, neither Labor nor Management had learned that." He looked from one to another of them. "The Guide must have a really good bodyguard, with all the enemies he's made."  Gregory shook his head. "He lives virtually alone, in a very small house on the UN Capitol grounds. In fact, except for a small police-force, armed only with non-lethal stun-guns, your profession of arms is non-existent."         *       *       *       *       *  "I've been guessing what you want me to do," Benson said. "You want this Guide bumped off. But why can't any of you do it? Or, if it's too risky, at least somebody from your own time? Why me?"  "We can't. Everybody in the world today is conditioned against violence, especially the taking of human life," Anthony told him.  "Now, wait a moment!" This time, he was using the voice he would have employed in chiding a couple of Anatolian peasant partisans who were field-stripping a machine gun the wrong way. "Those babies in that film you showed me weren't dying of old age...."  "That is not violence," Paula said bitterly. "That is humane beneficence. Ugly people would be unhappy, and would make others unhappy, in a world where everybody else is beautiful."  "And all these oppressive and tyrannical laws," Benson continued. "How does he enforce them, without violence, actual or threatened?"  Samuel started to say something about the Power of the Evil One; Paula, ignoring him, said:  "I really don't know; he just does it. Mass hypnotism of some sort. I know music has something to do with it, because there is always music, everywhere. This laboratory, for instance, was secretly soundproofed; we couldn't have worked here, otherwise."  "All right. I can see that you'd need somebody from the past, preferably a soldier, whose conditioning has been in favor rather than against violence. I'm not the only one you snatched, I take it?"  "No. We've been using that machine to pick up men from battlefields all over the world and all over history," Gregory said. "Until now, none of them could adjust.... Uggh!" He shuddered, looking even sicker than when the film was being shown.  "He's thinking," Walter said, "about a French officer from Waterloo who blew out his brains with a pocket-pistol on that table, and an English archer from Agincourt who ran amok with a dagger in here, and a trooper of the Seventh Cavalry from the Custer Massacre."  Gregory managed to overcome his revulsion. "You see, we were forced to take our subjects largely at random with regard to individual characteristics, mental attitudes, adaptability, et cetera." As long as he stuck to high order abstractions, he could control himself. "Aside from their professional lack of repugnance for violence, we took soldiers from battlefields because we could select men facing immediate death, whose removal from the past would not have any effect upon the casual chain of events affecting the present."  A warning buzzer rasped in Benson's brain. He nodded, poker-faced.  "I can see that," he agreed. "You wouldn't dare do anything to change the past. That was always one of the favorite paradoxes in time-travel fiction.... Well, I think I have the general picture. You have a dictator who is tyrannizing you; you want to get rid of him; you can't kill him yourselves. I'm opposed to dictators, myself; that--and the Selective Service law, of course--was why I was a soldier. I have no moral or psychological taboos against killing dictators, or anybody else. Suppose I cooperate with you; what's in it for me?"  There was a long silence. Walter and Carl looked at one another inquiringly; the others dithered helplessly. It was Carl who answered.  "Your return to your own time and place."  "And if I don't cooperate with you?"  "Guess when and where else we could send you," Walter said.  Benson dropped his cigarette and tramped it.  "Exactly the same time and place?" he asked.  "Well, the structure of space-time demands...." Paula began.  "The spatio-temporal displacement field is capable of identifying that spot--" Gregory pointed to a ten-foot circle in front of a bank of sleek-cabineted, dial-studded machines "--with any set of space-time coordinates in the universe. However, to avoid disruption of the structure of space-time, we must return you to approximately the same point in space-time."  Benson nodded again, this time at the confirmation of his earlier suspicion. Well, while he was alive, he still had a chance.  "All right; tell me exactly what you want me to do."         *       *       *       *       *  A third outbreak of bedlam, this time of relief and frantic explanation.  "Shut up, all of you!" For so thin a man, Carl had an astonishing voice. "I worked this out, so let me tell it." He turned to Benson. "Maybe I'm tougher than the rest of them, or maybe I'm not as deeply conditioned. For one thing, I'm tone-deaf. Well, here's the way it is. Gregory can set the machine to function automatically. You stand where he shows you, press the button he shows you, and fifteen seconds later it'll take you forward in time five seconds and about a kilometer in space, to The Guide's office. He'll be at his desk now. You'll have forty-five seconds to do the job, from the time the field collapses around you till it rebuilds. Then you'll be taken back to your own time again. The whole thing's automatic."  "Can do," Benson agreed. "How do I kill him?"  "I'm getting sick!" Paula murmured weakly. Her face was whiter than her gown.  "Take care of her, Samuel. Both of you'd better get out of here," Gregory said.  "The Lord of Hosts is my strength, He will.... Uggggh!" Samuel gasped.  "Conditioning's getting him, too; we gotta be quick," Carl said. "Here. This is what you'll use." He handed Benson a two-inch globe of black plastic. "Take the damn thing, quick! Little button on the side; press it, and get it out of your hand fast...." He retched. "Limited-effect bomb; everything within two-meter circle burned to nothing; outside that, great but not unendurable heat. Shut your eyes when you throw it. Flash almost blinding." He dropped his cigar and turned almost green in the face. Walter had a drink poured and handed it to him. "Uggh! Thanks, Walter." He downed it.  "Peculiar sort of thing for a non-violent people to manufacture," Benson said, looking at the bomb and then putting it in his jacket pocket.  "It isn't a weapon. Industrial; we use it in mining. I used plenty of them, in Walter's iron mines."  He nodded again. "Where do I stand, now?" he asked.  "Right over here." Gregory placed him in front of a small panel with three buttons. "Press the middle one, and step back into the small red circle and stand perfectly still while the field builds up and collapses. Face that way."         *       *       *       *       *  Benson drew his pistol and checked it; magazine full, a round in the chamber, safety on.  "Put that horrid thing out of sight!" Anthony gasped. "The ... the other thing ... is what you want to use."  "The bomb won't be any good if some of his guards come in before the field re-builds," Benson said.  "He has no guards. He lives absolutely alone. We told you...."  "I know you did. You probably believed it, too. I don't. And by the way, you're sending me forward. What do you do about the fact that a time-jump seems to make me pass out?"  "Here. Before you press the button, swallow it." Gregory gave him a small blue pill.  "Well, I guess that's all there is," Gregory continued. "I hope...." His face twitched, and he dropped to the floor with a thud. Carl and Walter came forward, dragged him away from the machine.  "Conditioning got him. Getting me, too," Walter said. "Hurry up, man!"  Benson swallowed the pill, pressed the button and stepped back into the red circle, drawing his pistol and snapping off the safety. The blue mist closed in on him.         *       *       *       *       *  This time, however, it did not thicken into blackness. It became luminous, brightening to a dazzle and dimming again to a colored mist, and then it cleared, while Benson stood at raise pistol, as though on a target range. He was facing a big desk at twenty feet, across a thick-piled blue rug. There was a man seated at the desk, a white-haired man with a mustache and a small beard, who wore a loose coat of some glossy plum-brown fabric, and a vividly blue neck-scarf.  The pistol centered on the v-shaped blue under his chin. Deliberately, Benson squeezed, recovered from the recoil, aimed, fired, recovered, aimed, fired. Five seconds gone. The old man slumped across the desk, his arms extended. Better make a good job of it, six, seven, eight seconds; he stepped forward to the edge of the desk, call that fifteen seconds, and put the muzzle to the top of the man's head, firing again and snapping on the safety. There had been something familiar about The Guide's face, but it was too late to check on that, now. There wasn't any face left; not even much head.  A box, on the desk, caught Benson's eye, a cardboard box with an envelope, stamped _Top Secret! For the Guide Only!_ taped to it. He holstered his pistol and caught that up, stuffing it into his pocket, in obedience to an instinct to grab anything that looked like intelligence matter while in the enemy's country. Then he stepped back to the spot where the field had deposited him. He had ten seconds to spare; somebody was banging on a door when the blue mist began to gather around him.         *       *       *       *       *  He was crouching, the spherical plastic object in his right hand, his thumb over the button, when the field collapsed. Sure enough, right in front of him, so close that he could smell the very heat of it, was the big tank with the red star on its turret. He cursed the sextet of sanctimonious double-crossers eight thousand miles and fifty years away in space-time. The machine guns had stopped--probably because they couldn't be depressed far enough to aim at him, now; that was a notorious fault of some of the newer Pan-Soviet tanks--and he rocked back on his heels, pressed the button, and heaved, closing his eyes. As the thing left his fingers, he knew that he had thrown too hard. His muscles, accustomed to the heavier cast-iron grenades of his experience, had betrayed him. For a moment, he was closer to despair than at any other time in the whole phantasmagoric adventure. Then he was hit, with physical violence, by a wave of almost solid heat. It didn't smell like the heat of the tank's engines; it smelled like molten metal, with undertones of burned flesh. Immediately, there was a multiple explosion that threw him flat, as the tank's ammunition went up. There were no screams. It was too fast for that. He opened his eyes.  The turret and top armor of the tank had vanished. The two massive treads had been toppled over, one to either side. The body had collapsed between them, and it was running sticky trickles of molten metal. He blinked, rubbed his eyes on the back of his hand, and looked again. Of all the many blasted and burned-out tanks, Soviet and UN, that he had seen, this was the most completely wrecked thing in his experience. And he'd done that with one grenade....         *       *       *       *       *  At that moment, there was a sudden rushing overhead, and an instant later the barrage began falling beyond the crest of the ridge. He looked at his watch, blinked, and looked again. That barrage was due at 0550; according to the watch, it was 0726. He was sure that, ten minutes ago, when he had looked at it, up there at the head of the ravine, it had been twenty minutes to six. He puzzled about that for a moment, and decided that he must have caught the stem on something and pulled it out, and then twisted it a little, setting the watch ahead. Then, somehow, the stem had gotten pushed back in, starting it at the new setting. That was a pretty far-fetched explanation, but it was the only one he could think of.  But about this tank, now. He was positive that he could remember throwing a grenade.... Yet he'd used his last grenade back there at the supply dump. He saw his carbine, and picked it up. That silly blackout he'd had, for a second, there; he must have dropped it. Action was open, empty magazine on the ground where he'd dropped it. He wondered, stupidly, if one of his bullets couldn't have gone down the muzzle of the tank's gun and exploded the shell in the chamber.... Oh, the hell with it! The tank might have been hit by a premature shot from the barrage which was raging against the far slope of the ridge. He reset his watch by guess and looked down the valley. The big attack would be starting any minute, now, and there would be fleeing Commies coming up the valley ahead of the UN advance. He'd better get himself placed before they started coming in on him.  He stopped thinking about the mystery of the blown-up tank, a solution to which seemed to dance maddeningly just out of his mental reach, and found himself a place among the rocks to wait. Down the valley he could hear everything from pistols to mortars going off, and shouting in three or four racial intonations. After a while, fugitive Communists began coming, many of them without their equipment, stumbling in their haste and looking back over their shoulders. Most of them avoided the mouth of the ravine and hurried by to the left or right, but one little clump, eight or ten, came up the dry stream-bed, and stopped a hundred and fifty yards from his hiding-place to make a stand. They were Hindus, with outsize helmets over their turbans. Two of them came ahead, carrying a machine gun, followed by a third with a flame-thrower; the others retreated more slowly, firing their rifles to delay pursuit.         *       *       *       *       *  Cuddling the stock of his carbine to his cheek, he divided a ten-shot burst between the two machine-gunners, then, as a matter of principle, he shot the man with the flame-thrower. He had a dislike for flame-throwers; he killed every enemy he found with one. The others dropped their rifles and raised their hands, screaming: "Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe! You no shoot, me no shoot!"  A dozen men in UN battledress came up and took them prisoner. Benson shouted to them, and then rose and came down to join them. They were British--Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, advertising the fact by inconspicuous bits of tartan on their uniforms. The subaltern in command looked at him and nodded.  "Captain Benson? We were warned to be on watch for your patrol," he said. "Any of the rest of you lads get out?"  Benson shrugged. "We split up after the attack. You may run into a couple of them. Some are locals and don't speak very good English. I've got to get back to Division, myself; what's the best way?"  "Down that way. You'll overtake a couple of our walking wounded. If you don't mind going slowly, they'll show you the way to advance dressing station, and you can hitch a ride on an ambulance from there."  Benson nodded. Off on the left, there was a flurry of small-arms fire, ending in yells of "Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe!"--the World War IV version of "Kamarad"!         *       *       *       *       *  His company was a non-T/O outfit; he came directly under Division command and didn't have to bother reporting to any regimental or brigade commanders. He walked for an hour with half a dozen lightly wounded Scots, rode for another hour on a big cat-truck loaded with casualties of six regiments and four races, and finally reached Division Rear, where both the Division and Corps commanders took time to compliment him on the part his last hunter patrol had played in the now complete breakthrough. His replacement, an equine-faced Spaniard with an imposing display of fruit-salad, was there, too; he solemnly took off the bracelet a refugee Caucasian goldsmith had made for his predecessor's predecessor and gave it to the new commander of what had formerly been Benson's Butchers. As he had expected, there was also another medal waiting for him.  A medical check at Task Force Center got him a warning; his last patrol had brought him dangerously close to the edge of combat fatigue. Remembering the incidents of the tank and the unaccountably fast watch, and the mysterious box and envelope which he had found in his coat pocket, he agreed, saying nothing about the questions that were puzzling him. The Psychological Department was never too busy to refuse another case; they hunted patients gleefully, each psych-shark seeking in every one proof of his own particular theories. It was with relief that he watched them fill out the red tag which gave him a priority on jet transports for home.  Ankara to Alexandria, Alexandria to Dakar, Dakar to Belem, Belem to the shattered skyline of New York, the "hurry-and-wait" procedures at Fort Carlisle, and, after the usual separation promotion, Major Fred Benson, late of Benson's Butchers, was back at teaching high school juniors the difference between H_{2}O and H_{2}SO_{4}.         *       *       *       *       *  There were two high schools in the city: McKinley High, on the east side, and Dwight Eisenhower High, on the west. A few blocks from McKinley was the Tulip Tavern, where the Eisenhower teachers came in the late afternoons; the McKinley faculty crossed town to do their after-school drinking on the west side. When Benson entered the Tulip Tavern, on a warm September afternoon, he found Bill Myers, the school psychologist, at one of the tables, smoking his pipe, checking over a stack of aptitude test forms, and drinking beer. He got a highball at the bar and carried it over to Bill's table.  "Oh, hi, Fred." The psychologist separated the finished from the unfinished work with a sheet of yellow paper and crammed the whole business into his brief case. "I was hoping somebody'd show up...."  Benson lit a cigarette, sipped his highball. They talked at random--school-talk; the progress of the war, now in its twelfth year; personal reminiscences, of the Turkish Theater where Benson had served, and the Madras Beachhead, where Myers had been.  "Bring home any souvenirs?" Myers asked.  "Not much. Couple of pistols, couple of knives, some pictures. I don't remember what all; haven't gotten around to unpacking them, yet.... I have a sixth of rye and some beer, at my rooms. Let's go around and see what I did bring home."  They finished their drinks and went out.  "What the devil's that?" Myers said, pointing to the cardboard box with the envelope taped to it, when Benson lifted it out of the gray-green locker.  "Bill, I don't know," Benson said. "I found it in the pocket of my coat, on my way back from my last hunter patrol.... I've never told anybody about this, before."  "That's the damnedest story I've ever heard, and in my racket you hear some honeys," Myers said, when he had finished. "You couldn't have picked that thing up in some other way, deliberately forgotten the circumstances, and fabricated this story about the tank and the grenade and the discrepancy in your watch subconsciously as an explanation?"  "My subconscious is a better liar than that," Benson replied. "It would have cobbled up some kind of a story that would stand up. This business...."  "Top Secret! For the Guide Only!" Myers frowned. "That isn't one of our marks, and if it were Soviet, it'd be tri-lingual, Russian, Hindi and Chinese."  "Well, let's see what's in it. I want this thing cleared up. I've been having some of the nastiest dreams, lately...."  "Well, be careful; it may be booby-trapped," Myers said urgently.  "Don't worry; I will."  He used a knife to slice the envelope open without untaping it from the box, and exposed five sheets of typewritten onion-skin paper. There was no letterhead, no salutation or address-line. Just a mass of chemical formulae, and a concise report on tests. It seemed to be a report on an improved syrup for a carbonated soft-drink. There were a few cryptic cautionary references to heightened physico-psychological effects.  The box was opened with the same caution, but it proved as innocent of dangers as the envelope. It contained only a half-liter bottle, wax-sealed, containing a dark reddish-brown syrup.  "There's a lot of this stuff I don't dig," Benson said, tapping the sheets of onion-skin. "I don't even scratch the surface of this rigamarole about The Guide. I'm going to get to work on this sample in the lab, at school, though. Maybe we have something, here."         *       *       *       *       *  At eight-thirty the next evening, after four and a half hours work, he stopped to check what he had found out.  The school's X-ray, an excellent one, had given him a complete picture of the molecular structure of the syrup. There were a couple of long-chain molecules that he could only believe after two re-examinations and a careful check of the machine, but with the help of the notes he could deduce how they had been put together. They would be the Ingredient Alpha and Ingredient Beta referred to in the notes.  The components of the syrup were all simple and easily procurable with these two exceptions, as were the basic components from which these were made.  The mechanical guinea-pig demonstrated that the syrup contained nothing harmful to human tissue.  Of course, there were the warnings about heightened psycho-physiological effects....  He stuck a poison-label on the bottle, locked it up, and went home. The next day, he and Bill Myers got a bottle of carbonated water and mixed themselves a couple of drinks of it. It was delicious--sweet, dry, tart, sour, all of these in alternating waves of pleasure.  "We do have something, Bill," he said. "We have something that's going to give our income-tax experts headaches."  "You have," Myers corrected. "Where do you start fitting me into it?"  "We're a good team, Bill. I'm a chemist, but I don't know a thing about people. You're a psychologist. A real one; not one of these night-school boys. A juvenile psychologist, too. And what age-group spends the most money in this country for soft-drinks?"  Knowing the names of the syrup's ingredients, and what their molecular structure was like, was only the beginning. Gallon after gallon of the School Board's chemicals went down the laboratory sink; Fred Benson and Bill Myers almost lived in the fourth floor lab. Once or twice there were head-shaking warnings from the principal about the dangers of over-work. The watchmen, at all hours, would hear the occasional twanging of Benson's guitar in the laboratory, and know that he had come to a dead end on something and was trying to think. Football season came and went; basketball season; the inevitable riot between McKinley and Eisenhower rooters; the Spring concerts. The term-end exams were only a month away when Benson and Myers finally did it, and stood solemnly, each with a beaker in either hand and took alternate sips of the original and the drink mixed from the syrup they had made.  "Not a bit of difference, Fred," Myers said. "We have it!"  Benson picked up the guitar and began plunking on it.  "Hey!" Myers exclaimed. "Have you been finding time to take lessons on that thing? I never heard you play as well as that!"         *       *       *       *       *  They decided to go into business in St. Louis. It was centrally located, and, being behind more concentric circles of radar and counter-rocket defenses, it was in better shape than any other city in the country and most likely to stay that way. Getting started wasn't hard; the first banker who tasted the new drink-named Evri-Flave, at Myers' suggestion--couldn't dig up the necessary money fast enough. Evri-Flave hit the market with a bang and became an instant success; soon the rainbow-tinted vending machines were everywhere, dispensing the slender, slightly flattened bottles and devouring quarters voraciously. In spite of high taxes and the difficulties of doing business in a consumers' economy upon which a war-time economy had been superimposed, both Myers and Benson were rapidly becoming wealthy. The gregarious Myers installed himself in a luxurious apartment in the city; Benson bought a large tract of land down the river toward Carondelet and started building a home and landscaping the grounds.  The dreams began bothering him again, now that the urgency of getting Evri-Flave, Inc., started had eased. They were not dreams of the men he had killed in battle, or, except for one about a huge, hot-smelling tank with a red star on the turret, about the war. Generally, they were about a strange, beautiful, office-room, in which a young man in uniform killed an older man in a plum-brown coat and a vivid blue neck-scarf. Sometimes Benson identified himself with the killer; sometimes with the old man who was killed.  He talked to Myers about these dreams, but beyond generalities about delayed effects of combat fatigue and vague advice to relax, the psychologist, now head of Sales & Promotion of Evri-Flave, Inc., could give him no help.  The war ended three years after the new company was launched. There was a momentary faltering of the economy, and then the work of reconstruction was crying hungrily for all the labor and capital that had been idled by the end of destruction, and more. There was a new flood-tide of prosperity, and Evri-Flave rode the crest. The estate at Carondelet was finished--a beautiful place, surrounded with gardens, fragrant with flowers, full of the songs of birds and soft music from concealed record-players. It made him forget the ugliness of the war, and kept the dreams from returning so frequently. All the world ought to be like that, he thought; beautiful and quiet and peaceful. People surrounded with such beauty couldn't think about war.  All the world could be like that, if only....         *       *       *       *       *  The UN chose St. Louis for its new headquarters--many of its offices had been moved there after the second and most destructive bombing of New York--and when the city by the Mississippi began growing into a real World Capital, the flow of money into it almost squared overnight. Benson began to take an active part in politics in the new World Sovereignty party. He did not, however, allow his political activities to distract him from the work of expanding the company to which he owed his wealth and position. There were always things to worry about.  "I don't know," Myers said to him, one evening, as they sat over a bottle of rye in the psychologist's apartment. "I could make almost as much money practicing as a psychiatrist, these days. The whole world seems to be going pure, unadulterated nuts! That affair in Munich, for instance."  "Yes." Benson grimaced as he thought of the affair in Munich--a Wagnerian concert which had terminated in an insane orgy of mass suicide. "Just a week after we started our free-sample campaign in South Germany, too...."  He stopped short, downing his drink and coughing over it.  "Bill! You remember those sheets of onion-skin in that envelope?"  "The foundation of our fortunes; I wonder where you really did get that.... Fred!" His eyes widened in horror. "That caution about 'heightened psycho-physiological effects,' that we were never able to understand!"  Benson nodded grimly. "And think of all the crazy cases of mass-hysteria--that baseball-game riot in Baltimore; the time everybody started tearing off each others' clothes in Milwaukee; the sex-orgy in New Orleans. And the sharp uptrend in individual psycho-neurotic and psychotic behavior. All in connection with music, too, and all after Evri-Flave got on the market."  "We'll have to stop it; pull Evri-Flave off the market," Myers said. "We can't be responsible for letting this go on."  "We can't stop, either. There's at least a two months' supply out in the hands of jobbers and distributors over whom we have no control. And we have all these contractual obligations, to buy the entire output of the companies that make the syrup for us; if we stop buying, they can sell it in competition with us, as long as they don't infringe our trade-name. And we can't prevent pirating. You know how easily we were able to duplicate that sample I brought back from Turkey. Why, our legal department's kept busy all the time prosecuting unlicensed manufacturers as it is."  "We've got to do something, Fred!" There was almost a whiff of hysteria in Myers' voice.  "We will. We'll start, first thing tomorrow, on a series of tests--just you and I, like the old times at Eisenhower High. First, we want to be sure that Evri-Flave really is responsible. It'd be a hell of a thing if we started a public panic against our own product for nothing. And then...."         *       *       *       *       *  It took just two weeks, in a soundproofed and guarded laboratory on Benson's Carondelet estate, to convict their delicious drink of responsibility for that Munich State Opera House Horror and everything else. Reports from confidential investigators in Munich confirmed this. It had, of course, been impossible to interview the two thousand men and women who had turned the Opera House into a pyre for their own immolation, but none of the tiny minority who had kept their sanity and saved their lives had tasted Evri-Flave.         *       *       *       *       *  It took another month to find out exactly how the stuff affected the human nervous system, and they almost wrecked their own nervous systems in the process. The real villain, they discovered, was the incredible-looking long-chain compound alluded to in the original notes as Ingredient Beta; its principal physiological effect was to greatly increase the sensitivity of the aural nerves. Not only was the hearing range widened--after consuming thirty CC of Beta, they could hear the sound of an ultrasonic dog-whistle quite plainly--but the very quality of all audible sounds was curiously enhanced and altered. Myers, the psychologist, who was also well grounded in neurology, explained how the chemical produced this effect; it meant about as much to Benson as some of his chemistry did to Bill Myers. There was also a secondary, purely psychological, effect. Certain musical chords had definite effects on the emotions of the hearer, and the subject, beside being directly influenced by the music, was rendered extremely open to verbal suggestions accompanied by a suitable musical background.  Benson transferred the final results of this stage of the research to the black notebook and burned the scratch-sheets.  "That's how it happened, then," he said. "The Munich thing was the result of all that Goetterdaemmerung music. There was a band at the baseball park in Baltimore. The New Orleans Orgy started while a local radio station was broadcasting some of this new dance-music. Look, these tone-clusters, here, have a definite sex-excitation effect. This series of six chords, which occur in some of the Wagnerian stuff; effect, a combined feeling of godlike isolation and despair. And these consecutive fifths--a sense of danger, anger, combativeness. You know, we could work out a whole range of emotional stimuli to fit the effects of Ingredient Beta...."  "We don't want to," Myers said. "We want to work out a substitute for Beta that will keep the flavor of the drink without the psycho-physiological effects."  "Yes, sure. I have some of the boys at the plant lab working on that. Gave them a lot of syrup without Beta, and told them to work out cheap additives to restore the regular Evri-Flave taste; told them it was an effort to find a cheap substitute for an expensive ingredient. But look, Bill. You and I both see, for instance, that a powerful world-wide supra-national sovereignty is the only guarantee of world peace. If we could use something like this to help overcome antiquated verbal prejudices and nationalistic emotional attachments...."  "No!" Myers said. "I won't ever consent to anything like that, Fred! Not even in a cause like world peace; use a thing like this for a good, almost holy, cause now, and tomorrow we, or those who would come after us, would be using it to create a tyranny. You know what year this is, Bill?"  "Why, 1984," Benson said.  "Yes. You remember that old political novel of Orwell's, written about forty years ago? Well, that's a picture of the kind of world you'd have, eventually, no matter what kind of a world you started out to make. Fred, don't ever think of using this stuff for a purpose like that. If you try it, I'll fight you with every resource I have."  There was a fanatical, almost murderous, look in Bill Myers' eyes. Benson put the notebook in his pocket, then laughed and threw up his hands.  "Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe!" he cried. "You're right, of course, Bill. We can't even trust the UN with a thing like this. It makes the H-bomb look like a stone hatchet.... Well, I'll call Grant, at the plant lab, and see how his boys are coming along with the substitute; as soon as we get it, we can put out a confidential letter to all our distributors and syrup-manufacturers...."         *       *       *       *       *  He walked alone in the garden at Carondelet, watching the color fade out of the sky and the twilight seep in among the clipped yews. All the world could be like this garden, a place of peace and beauty and quiet, if only.... All the world _would_ be a beautiful and peaceful garden, in his own lifetime! He had the means of making it so!  Three weeks later, he murdered his friend and partner, Bill Myers. It was a suicide; nobody but Fred Benson knew that he had taken fifty CC of pure Ingredient Beta in a couple of cocktails while listening to the queer phonograph record that he had played half an hour before blowing his brains out.  The decision had cost Benson a battle with his conscience from which he had emerged the sole survivor. The conscience was buried along with Bill Myers, and all that remained was a purpose.  Evri-Flave stayed on the market unaltered. The night before the national election, the World Sovereignty party distributed thousands of gallons of Evri-Flave; their speakers, on every radio and television network, were backgrounded by soft music. The next day, when the vote was counted, it was found that the American Nationalists had carried a few backwoods precincts in the Rockies and the Southern Appalachians and one county in Alaska, where there had been no distribution of Evri-Flave.  The dreams came back more often, now that Bill Myers was gone. Benson was only beginning to realize what a large fact in his life the companionship of the young psychologist had been. Well, a world of peace and beauty was an omelet worth the breaking of many eggs....  He purchased another great tract of land near the city, and donated it to the UN for their new headquarters buildings; the same architects and landscapists who had created the estate at Carondelet were put to work on it. In the middle of what was to become World City, they erected a small home for Fred Benson. Benson was often invited to address the delegates to the UN; always, there was soft piped-in music behind his words. He saw to it that Evri-Flave was available free to all UN personnel. The Senate of the United States elected him as perpetual U. S. delegate-in-chief to the UN; not long after, the Security Council elected him their perpetual chairman.  In keeping with his new dignities, and to ameliorate his youthful appearance, he grew a mustache and, eventually, a small beard. The black notebook in which he kept the records of his experiments was always with him; page after page was filled with notes. Experiments in sonics, like the one which had produced the ultrasonic stun-gun which rendered lethal weapons unnecessary for police and defense purposes, or the new musical combinations with which he was able to play upon every emotion and instinct.  But he still dreamed, the same recurring dream of the young soldier and the old man in the office. By now, he was consistently identifying himself with the latter. He took to carrying one of the thick-barrelled stun-pistols always, now. Alone, he practiced constantly with it, drawing, breaking soap-bubbles with the concentrated sound-waves it projected. It was silly, perhaps, but it helped him in his dreams. Now, the old man with whom he identified himself would draw a stun-pistol, occasionally, to defend himself.  The years drained one by one through the hour-glass of Time. Year after year, the world grew more peaceful, more beautiful. There were no more incidents like the mass-suicide of Munich or the mass-perversions of New Orleans; the playing and even the composing of music was strictly controlled--no dangerous notes or chords could be played in a world drenched with Ingredient Beta. Steadily the idea grew that peace and beauty were supremely good, that violence and ugliness were supremely evil. Even competitive sports which simulated violence; even children born ugly and misshapen....         *       *       *       *       *  He finished the breakfast which he had prepared for himself--he trusted no food that another had touched--and knotted the vivid blue scarf about his neck before slipping into the loose coat of glossy plum-brown, then checked the stun-pistol and pocketed the black notebook, its plastileather cover glossy from long use. He stood in front of the mirror, brushing his beard, now snow-white. Two years, now, and he would be eighty--had he been anyone but The Guide, he would have long ago retired to the absolute peace and repose of one of the Elders' Havens. Peace and repose, however, were not for The Guide; it would take another twenty years to finish his task of remaking the world, and he would need every day of it that his medical staff could borrow or steal for him. He made an eye-baffling practice draw with the stun-pistol, then holstered it and started down the spiral stairway to the office below.  There was the usual mass of papers on his desk. A corps of secretaries had screened out everything but what required his own personal and immediate attention, but the business of guiding a world could only be reduced to a certain point. On top was the digest of the world's news for the past twenty-four hours, and below that was the agenda for the afternoon's meeting of the Council. He laid both in front of him, reading over the former and occasionally making a note on the latter. Once his glance strayed to the cardboard box in front of him, with the envelope taped to it--the latest improvement on the Evri-Flave syrup, with the report from his own chemists, all conditioned to obedience, loyalty and secrecy. If they thought he was going to try that damned stuff on himself....  There was a sudden gleam of light in the middle of the room, in front of his desk. No, a mist, through which a blue light seemed to shine. The stun-pistol was in his hand--his instinctive reaction to anything unusual--and pointed into the shining mist when it vanished and a man appeared in front of him; a man in the baggy green combat-uniform that he himself had worn fifty years before; a man with a heavy automatic pistol in his hand. The gun was pointed directly at him.         *       *       *       *       *  The Guide aimed quickly and pressed the trigger of the ultrasonic stunner. The pistol dropped soundlessly on the thick-piled rug; the man in uniform slumped in an inert heap. The Guide sprang to his feet and rounded the desk, crossing to and bending over the intruder. Why, this was the dream that had plagued him through the years. But it was ending differently. The young man--his face was startlingly familiar, somehow--was not killing the old man. Those years of practice with the stun-pistol....  He stooped and picked the automatic up. The young man was unconscious, and The Guide had his pistol, now. He slipped the automatic into his pocket and straightened beside his inert would-be slayer.  A shimmering globe of blue mist appeared around them, brightened to a dazzle, and dimmed again to a colored mist before it vanished, and when it cleared away, he was standing beside the man in uniform, in the sandy bed of a dry stream at the mouth of a little ravine, and directly in front of him, looming above him, was a thing that had not been seen in the world for close to half a century--a big, hot-smelling tank with a red star on its turret.  He might have screamed--the din of its treads and engines deafened him--and, in panic, he turned and ran, his old legs racing, his old heart pumping madly. The noise of the tank increased as machine guns joined the uproar. He felt the first bullet strike him, just above the hips--no pain; just a tremendous impact. He might have felt the second bullet, too, as the ground tilted and rushed up at his face. Then he was diving into a tunnel of blackness that had no end....         *       *       *       *       *  Captain Fred Benson, of Benson's Butchers, had been jerked back into consciousness when the field began to build around him. He was struggling to rise, fumbling the grenade out of his pocket, when it collapsed. Sure enough, right in front of him, so close that he could smell the very heat of it, was the big tank with the red star on its turret. He cursed the sextet of sanctimonious double-crossers eight thousand miles and fifty years away in space-time. The machine guns had stopped--probably because they couldn't be depressed far enough to aim at him, now; that was a notorious fault of some of the newer Pan-Soviet tanks. He had the bomb out of his pocket, when the machine guns began firing again, this time at something on his left. Wondering what had created the diversion, he rocked back on his heels, pressed the button, and heaved, closing his eyes. As the thing left his fingers, he knew that he had thrown too hard. His muscles, accustomed to the heavier cast-iron grenades, had betrayed him. For a moment, he was closer to despair than at any other time in the whole phantasmagoric adventure. Then he was hit, with physical force, by a wave of almost solid heat. It didn't smell like the heat of the tank's engines; it smelled like molten metal, with undertones of burned flesh. Immediately, there was a multiple explosion that threw him flat, as the tank's ammunition went up. There were no screams. It was too fast for that. He opened his eyes.  The turret and top armor of the tank had vanished. The two massive treads had been toppled over, one to either side. The body had collapsed between them, and it was running sticky trickles of molten metal. He blinked, rubbed his eyes on the back of his hand, and looked again. Of all the many blasted and burned-out tanks, Soviet and UN, that he had seen, this was the most completely wrecked thing in his experience. And he'd done that with one grenade....  Remembering the curious manner in which, at the last, the tank had begun firing at something to the side, he looked around, to see the crumpled body in the pale violet-gray trousers and the plum-brown coat. Finding his carbine and reloading it, he went over to the dead man, turning the body over. He was an old man, with a white mustache and a small white beard--why, if the mustache were smaller and there were no beard, he would pass for Benson's own father, who had died in 1962. The clothes weren't Turkish or Armenian or Persian, or anything one would expect in this country.  The old man had a pistol in his coat pocket, and Benson pulled it out and looked at it, then did a double-take and grabbed for his own holster, to find it empty. The pistol was his own 9.5 Colt automatic. He looked at the dead man, with the white beard and the vivid blue neck-scarf, and he was sure that he had never seen him before. He'd had that pistol when he'd come down the ravine....  There was another pistol under the dead man's coat, in a shoulder-holster; a queer thing with a thick round barrel, like an old percussion pepper-box, and a diaphragm instead of a muzzle. Probably projected ultrasonic waves. He holstered his own Colt and pocketed the unknown weapon. There was a black plastileather-bound notebook. It was full of notes. Chemical formulae, yes, and some stuff on sonics; that tied in with the queer pistol. He pocketed that. He'd look both over, when he had time and privacy, two scarce commodities in the Army....         *       *       *       *       *  At that moment, there was a sudden rushing overhead, and an instant later, the barrage began falling beyond the crest of the ridge. He looked at his watch, blinked, and looked again. That barrage was due at 0550; according to his watch, it was 0726. That was another mystery, to go with the question of who the dead man was, where he had come from, and how he'd gotten hold of Benson's pistol. Yes, and how that tank had gotten blown up. Benson was sure he had used his last grenade back at the supply-dump.  The hell with it; he'd worry about all that later. The attack was due any minute, now, and there would be fleeing Commies coming up the valley ahead, of the UN advance. He'd better get himself placed before they started coming in on him.  He stopped thinking about the multiple mystery, a solution to which seemed to dance maddeningly just out of his mental reach, and found himself a place among the rocks to wait, and while he waited, he looked over the plastileather-bound notebook. In civil life, he had been a high school chemistry teacher, but the stuff in this book was utterly new to him. Some of it he could understand readily enough; the rest of it he could dig out for himself. Stuff about some kind of a carbonated soft-drink, and about a couple of unbelievable-looking long-chain molecules....  After a while, fugitive Communists began coming up the valley to make their stand.  Benson put away the notebook, picked up his carbine, and cuddled the stock to his cheek....   THE ENDI   Talk of heat--or better not--on Xecho. This water-logged world combined all the most unattractive features of a steam bath and one could only dream of coolness, greenness--more land than a stingy string of islands.  The young man on the promontory above the crash of the waves wore the winged cap of a spaceman with the insignia of a cargo-master and not much else, save a pair of very short shorts. He wiped one hand absently across his bare chest and brought it away damp as he studied, through protective sun goggles, the treacherous promise of the bright sea. One _could_ swim--if he wanted to lose most of his skin. There were minute organisms in that liquid that smacked their lips--if they had lips--every time they thought of a Terran.  Dane Thorson licked his own lips, tasting salt, and plodded back through the sand of the spaceport to the berth of the _Solar Queen_. This had been a long day, and one with more snarl-ups than he cared to count, keeping him on a constant, dogged trot between the ship and the fitting yard where riggers labored with the slowest motions possible to the human body--or so it seemed to the exasperated acting-Cargo-Master of the Free Trader. Captain Jellico had long ago taken refuge in his cabin to preserve the remnants of his temper. Dane had been allowed no such escape.  The _Queen_ had a schedule for refitting to serve as a mail ship, and that time allowance did not allow for humidity playing the devil with the innards of robot fitters. She _had_ to be ready to lift when the Combine ship now plying that run set down and formally signed off in her favor. Luckily, most of the work was done and Dane had given a last searching inspection before signing the rigger's book and reporting to his captain.  The air-conditioned interior of the _Queen_ comforted him as he climbed to his quarters. Ship air was flat, chemically pure but unappetizing stuff. Today it was a relief to breathe. Dane went on to the bather. At least there was no lack of water--with the local skinners filtered out. It was chill but relaxing on his gaunt young body.  He was sealing on his lightest tunic when the ramp buzzer sounded. A visitor--oh, not the supervisor-rigger again! Dane went to answer with dragging feet. For the crew of the _Queen_ at the moment numbered exactly four, with himself for general errand boy. Captain Jellico was in his quarters two levels above, Medic Tau was presumably overhauling his supplies, and Sindbad, ship's cat, asleep in some empty cabin.  Dane jerked his tunic into place, very much on his guard as he came to the head of the ramp. But it was not the supervisor-rigger. Dane, thoroughly used to unusual-appearing strangers, both human and alien, was impressed by this visitor.  He was tall, this quiet man, his great height accented by a fit leanness, a narrowness of waist and hip, a length of leg and arm. His main article of clothing was the universal shorts of the Xecho settler. But, being fashioned of saffron yellow, they were the more brilliant because of his darkness of skin. For he was not the warm brown of the Terran Negroes Dane had served beside, though he shared their general features. His flesh was really black, black with an almost bluish sheen. Instead of shirt or tunic, his deep chest was crossed by two wide straps, the big medallion marking their intersection giving forth flashes of gem fire when he breathed. He wore at his belt not the standard stun gun of a spaceman, but a weapon which resembled the more deadly Patrol blaster, as well as a long knife housed in a jeweled and fringed sheath. To the eye he was an example of barbaric force tamed and trimmed to civilized efficiency.  He saluted, palm out, and spoke Galactic Basic with only a suggestion of accent.  "I am Kort Asaki. I believe Captain Jellico expects me."  "Yes, sir!" Dane snapped to attention. So this was the Chief Ranger from fabulous Khatka, Xecho's sister planet.  The other ascended the cat ladder easily, missing no detail of the ship's interior as he passed. His expression was still one of polite interest as his guide rapped on the panel door of Jellico's cabin. And a horrible screech from Queex, the captain's pet hoobat, drowned out any immediate answer. Then followed that automatic thump on the floor of the blue-feathered, crab-parrot-toad's cage, announcing that its master was in residence.  Since the captain's cordial welcome extended only to his guest, Dane regretfully descended to the mess cabin to make unskilled preparations for supper--though there was not much you could do to foul up concentrates in an automatic cooker.  "Company?" Tau sat beyond the cooking unit nursing a mug of Terran coffee. "And do you _have_ to serve music with the meals, especially that particular selection?"  Dane flushed, stopped whistling in mid-note. "Terra Bound" _was_ old and pretty well worn out; he didn't know why he always unconsciously sounded off with that.  "A Chief Ranger from Khatka just came on board," he reported, carefully offhand, as he busied himself reading labels. He knew better than to serve fish or any of its derivatives in disguise again.  "Khatka!" Tau sat up straighter. "Now there's a planet worth visiting."  "Not on a Free Trader's pay," commented Dane.  "You can always hope to make a big strike, boy. But what I wouldn't give to lift ship for there!"  "Why? You're no hunter. How come you want to heat jets for that port?"  "Oh, I don't care about the game preserves, though they're worth seeing, too. It's the people themselves--"  "But they're Terran settlers, or at least from Terran stock, aren't they?"  "Sure," Tau sipped his coffee slowly. "But there are settlers and settlers, son. And a lot depends upon when they left Terra and why, and who they were--also what happened to them after they landed out here."  "And Khatkans are really special?"  "Well, they have an amazing history. The colony was founded by escaped prisoners--and just one racial stock. They took off from Earth close to the end of the Second Atomic War. That was a race war, remember? Which made it doubly ugly." Tau's mouth twisted in disgust. "As if the color of a man's skin makes any difference in what lies under it! One side in that line-up tried to take over Africa--herded most of the natives into a giant concentration camp and practiced genocide on a grand scale. Then they were cracked themselves, hard and heavy. During the confusion some survivors in the camp staged a revolt, helped by the enemy. They captured an experimental station hidden in the center of the camp and made a break into space in two ships which had been built there. That voyage must have been a nightmare, but they were desperate. Somehow they made it out here to the rim and set down on Khatka without power enough to take off again--and by then most of them were dead.  "But we humans, no matter what our race, are a tough breed. The refugees discovered that climatically their new world was not too different from Africa, a lucky chance which might happen only once in a thousand times. So they thrived, the handful who survived. But the white technicians they had kidnaped to run the ships didn't. For they set up a color bar in reverse. The lighter your skin, the lower you were in the social scale. By that kind of selective breeding the present Khatkans are very dark indeed.  "They reverted to the primitive for survival. Then, about two hundred years ago, long before the first Survey Scout discovered them, something happened. Either the parent race mutated, or, as sometimes occurs, a line of people of superior gifts emerged--not in a few isolated births, but with surprising regularity in five family clans. There was a short period of power struggle until they realized the foolishness of civil war and formed an oligarchy, heading a loose tribal organization. With the Five Families to push and lead, a new civilization developed, and when Survey came to call they were no longer savages. Combine bought the trade rights about seventy-five years ago. Then the Company and the Five Families got together and marketed a luxury item to the galaxy. You know how every super-jet big shot on twenty-five planets wants to say he's hunted on Khatka. And if he can point out a graz head on his wall, or wear a tail bracelet, he's able to strut with the best. To holiday on Khatka is both fabulous and fashionable--and very, very profitable for the natives and for Combine who sells transportation to the travelers."  "I hear they have poachers, too," Dane remarked.  "Yes, that naturally follows. You know what a glam skin brings on the market. Wherever you have a rigidly controlled export you're going to have poachers and smugglers. But the Patrol doesn't go to Khatka. The natives handle their own criminals. Personally, I'd cheerfully take a ninety-nine-year sentence in the Lunar mines in place of what the Khatkans dish out to a poacher they net!"  "So that rumor has spread satisfactorily!"  Coffee slopped over the brim of Tau's mug and Dane dropped the packet of steak concentrate he was about to feed into the cooker. Chief Ranger Asaki loomed in the doorway of the mess as suddenly as if he had been teleported to that point.  The medic arose to his feet and smiled politely at the visitor.  "Do I detect in that observation, sir, the suggestion that the tales I have heard were deliberately set to blast where they would do the most good as deterrents?"  A fleeting grin broke the impassive somberness of the black face.  "I was informed you are a man skilled in 'magic,' Medic. You certainly display the traditional sorcerer's quickness of wit. But this rumor is also truth." The quirk of good humor had gone again, and there was an edge in the Chief Ranger's voice which cut. "Poachers on Khatka would welcome the Patrol in place of the attention they now receive."  He came into the mess cabin, Jellico behind him, and Dane pulled down two of the snap seats. He was holding a mug under the spout of the coffee dispenser as the captain made introductions.  "Thorson--our acting-cargo-master."  "Thorson," the Khatkan acknowledged with a grave nod of his head, and then glanced down to floor level with a look of surprise. Weaving a pattern about his legs, purring loudly, Sindbad was offering an unusually fervent welcome of his own. The Ranger went down on one knee, his hand out for Sindbad's inquiring sniff. Then the cat butted that dark palm, batted at it playfully with claw-sheathed paw.  "A Terran cat! It is of the lion family?"  "Far removed," Jellico supplied. "You'd have to add a lot of bulk to Sindbad to promote him to the lion class."  "We have only the old tales." Asaki sounded almost wistful as the cat jumped to his knee and clawed for a hold on his chest belts. "But I do not believe that lions were ever so friendly toward my ancestors."  Dane would have removed the cat, but the Khatkan arose with Sindbad, still purring loudly, resting in the crook of his arm. The Ranger was smiling with a gentleness which changed the whole arrogant cast of his countenance.  "Do not bring this one to Khatka with you, Captain, or you will never take him away again. Those who dwell in the inner courts would not let him vanish from their sight. Ah, so this pleases you, small lion?" He rubbed Sindbad gently under the throat and the cat stretched his neck, his yellow eyes half closed in bliss.  "Thorson," the Captain turned to Dane, "that arrival report on my desk was the final one from Combine?"  "Yes, sir. There's no hope of the _Rover_ setting down here before that date."  Asaki sat down, still holding the cat. "So you see, Captain, fortune has arranged it all. You have two tens of days. Four days to go in my cruiser, four days for your return here, and the rest to explore the preserve. We could not ask for better luck, for I do not know when our paths may cross again. In the normal course of events I will not have another mission to Xecho for a year, perhaps longer. Also--" He hesitated and then spoke to Tau. "Medic, Captain Jellico has informed me that you have made a study of magic on many worlds."  "That is so, sir."  "Do you then believe that it is real force, or that it is only a superstition for child-people who set up demons to howl petitions to when some darkness falls upon them?"  "Some of the magic I have seen is trickery, some of it founded upon an inner knowledge of men and their ways which a shrewd witch doctor can use to his advantage. There always remains"--Tau put down his mug, "--there always remains a small residue of happenings and results for which we have not yet found any logical explanations--"  "And I believe," Asaki interrupted, "it is also true that a race can be conditioned from birth to be sensitive to forms of magic so that men of that blood are particularly susceptible." That was more of a statement than a question, but Tau answered it.  "That is very true. A Lamorian, for example, can be 'sung' to death. I have witnessed such a case. But upon a Terran or another off-world man the same suggestion would have no effect."  "Those who settled Khatka brought such magic with them." The Chief Ranger's fingers still moved about Sindbad's jaw and throat soothingly, but his tone was chill, the coldest thing in the cramped space of the mess cabin.  "Yes, a highly developed form of it," Tau agreed.  "More highly developed perhaps than even you can believe, Medic!" That came in a hiss of cold rage. "I think that its present manifestation--death by a beast that is not a beast--could be worth your detailed study."  "Why?" Tau came bluntly to the point.  "Because it is a killing magic and it is being carefully used to rid my world of key men, men we need badly. If there is a weak point in this cloudy attack shaping against us, we must learn it, and soon!"  It was Jellico who added the rest. "We are invited to visit Khatka and survey a new hunting range as Chief Ranger Asaki's personal term guests."  Dane drew a deep breath of wonder. Guest rights on Khatka were jealously guarded--they were too valuable to their owners to waste. Whole families lived on the income from the yearly rental of even half a one. But the Rangers, by right of office, had several which they could grant to visiting scientists or men from other worlds holding positions similar to their own. To have such an opportunity offered to an ordinary Trader was almost incredible.  His wonder was matched by Tau's and must have been plain to read for the Chief Ranger smiled.  "For a long time Captain Jellico and I have exchanged biological data on alien life-forms--his skill in photographing such, his knowledge as an xenobiologist are widely recognized. And so I have permission for him to visit the new Zoboru preserve, not yet officially opened. And you, Medic Tau, your help, or at least your diagnosis, we need in another direction. So, one expert comes openly, another not so openly. Though, Medic, your task is approved by my superiors. And"--he glanced at Dane--"perhaps to muddle the trail for the suspicious, shall we not ask this young man also?"  Dane's eyes went to the captain. Jellico was always fair and his crew would have snapped into action on his word alone--even if they were fronting a rain of Thorkian death darts and that order was to advance. But, on the other hand, Dane would never have asked a favor, and the best he hoped for was to be able to perform his duties without unfavorable comment upon their commission. He had no reason to believe Jellico was willing to agree to this.  "You have two weeks' planet-side leave coming, Thorson. If you want to spend it on Khatka...." Jellico actually grinned then. "I take it that you do. When do we up-ship, sir?"  "You said that you must wait for the return of your other crew members--shall we say mid-afternoon tomorrow?" The Chief Ranger stood up and put Sindbad down though the cat protested with several sharp meows.  "Small lion," the tall Khatkan spoke to the cat as to an equal, "this is your jungle, and mine lies elsewhere. But should you ever grow tired of traveling the stars, there is always a home for you in my courts."  When the Chief Ranger went out the door, Sindbad did not try to follow, but he uttered one mournful little cry of protest and loss.  "So he wants a trouble shooter, does he?" Tau asked. "All right, I'll try to hunt out his goblins for him; it'll be worth that to visit Khatka!"  Dane, remembering the hot glare of the Xecho spaceport, the sea one could not swim in, contrasted that with the tri-dees he had seen of the green hunters' paradise on the next planet of the system. "Yes, sir!" he echoed and made a haphazard choice for the cooker.  "Don't be too lighthearted," Tau warned. "I'll say that any stew which was too hot for that Ranger to handle might give us burned fingers--and quick. When we land on Khatka, walk softly and look over your shoulder, and be prepared for the worst."     II   Lightning played along the black ridges above them, and below was a sheer drop to a river which was only a silver thread. Under their boots, man-made and yet dominating the wildness of jungle and mountain, was a platform of rock slabs, fused to support a palace of towering yellow-white walls and curved cups of domes, a palace which was also half fortress, half frontier post.  Dane set his hands on the parapet of the river drop, blinked as a lightning bolt crackled in a sky-splitting glare of violet fire. This was about as far from the steaming islands of Xecho as a man could imagine.  "The demon graz prepare for battle." Asaki nodded toward the distant crackling.  Captain Jellico laughed. "Supposed to be whetting their tusks, eh? I wouldn't care to meet a graz that could produce such a display by mere tusk whetting."  "No? But think of the reward for the tracker who discovers where such go to die. To find the graveyard of the graz herds would make any man wealthy beyond dreams."  "How much truth is there in that legend?" Tau asked.  The Chief Ranger shrugged. "Who can say? This much _is_ true: I have served my life in the forests since I could walk. I have listened to the talk of Trackers, Hunters, Rangers in my father's courtyards and field camps since I could understand their words. Yet never has any man reported the finding of a body of a graz that died a natural death. The scavengers might well account for the bulk of flesh, but the tusks and the bones should be visible for years. And this, too, I have seen with my own eyes: a graz close to death, supported by two of its kind and being urged along to the big swamps. Perhaps it is only that the suffering animal longs for water at its end, or perhaps in the heart of that morass there does lie the graz graveyard. But no man has found a naturally dead graz, nor has any returned from exploring the big swamps...."  Lightning on peaks which were like polished jet--bare rock above, the lush overgrowth of jungle below. And between, this fortress held by men who dared both the heights and the depths. The wildly burgeoning life of Khatka had surrounded the off-worlders since they had come here. There was something untameable about Khatka; the lush planet lured and yet repelled at the same time.  "Zoboru far from here?"  The Chief Ranger pointed north in answer to the captain's question.  "About a hundred leagues. It is the first new preserve we have prepared in ten years. And it is our desire to make it the best for tri-dee hunters. That is why we are now operating taming teams--"  "Taming teams?" Dane had to ask.  The Chief Ranger was ready enough to discuss his project.  "Zoboru is a no-kill preserve. The animals, they come to learn that after a while. But we cannot wait several years until they do. So we make them gifts." He laughed, evidently recalling some incident. "Sometimes, perhaps, we are too eager. Most of our visitors who wish to make tri-dees want to picture big game--graz, amplet, rock apes, lions--"  "Lions?" echoed Dane.  "Not Terran lions, no. But my people, when they landed on Khatka, found a few animals that reminded them of those they had always known. So they gave those the same names. A Khatkan lion is furred, it is a hunter and a great fighter, but it is not the cat of Terra. However, it is in great demand as a tri-dee actor. So we summon it out of lurking by providing free meals. One shoots a poli, a water rat, or a landeer and drags the carcass behind a low-flying flitter. The lion springs upon the moving meat, which it can also scent, and the rope is cut, leaving a free dinner.  "The lions are not stupid. In a very short time they connect the sound of a flitter cutting the air with food. So they come to the banquet and those on the flitter can take their tri-dee shots at ease. Only there must also be care taken in such training. One forest guard on the Komog preserve became too enterprising. He dragged his kill at first. Then, to see if he could get the lions to forget man's presence entirely, he hung the training carcasses on the flitter, encouraging them to jump for their food.  "For the guard that was safe enough, but it worked too too well. A month or so later a Hunter was escorting a client through Komog and they swung low to get a good picture of a water rat emerging from the river. Suddenly there was a snarl behind them and they found themselves sharing the flitter with a lioness annoyed at finding no meat waiting on board.  "Luckily, they both wore stass belts; but they had to land the flitter and leave until the lioness wandered off, and she seriously damaged the machine in her irritation. So now our guards play no more fancy tricks while on taming runs. Tomorrow--no," he corrected himself, "the day after tomorrow I will be able to show you how the process works."  "And tomorrow?" inquired the captain.  "Tomorrow my men make hunting magic." Asaki's voice was expressionless.  "Your chief witch doctor being?" questioned Tau.  "Lumbrilo." The Chief Ranger did not appear disposed to add to that but Tau pursued the subject.  "His office is hereditary?"  "Yes. Does that make any difference?" For the first time there was a current of repressed eagerness in the other's tone.  "Perhaps a vast amount of difference," Tau replied. "A hereditary office may carry with it two forms of conditioning, one to influence its holder, one to affect the public-at-large. Your Lumbrilo may have come to believe deeply in his own powers; he would be a very remarkable man if he did not. It is almost certain that your people unquestionably accept him as a worker of wonders?"  "They do so accept." Once more Asaki's voice was drained of life.  "And Lumbrilo does not accept something you believe necessary?"  "Again the truth, Medic. Lumbrilo does not accept his proper place in the scheme of things!"  "He is a member of one of your Five Families?"  "No, his clan is small, always set apart. From the beginning here, those who spoke for gods and demons did not also order men."  "Separation of church and state," commented Tau thoughtfully. "Yet in our Terran past there have been times when church and state were one. Does Lumbrilo desire that?"  Asaki raised his eyes to the mountain peaks, to the northward where lay his beloved work.  "I do not know what Lumbrilo wants, save that it makes mischief--or worse! This I tell you: hunting magic is part of our lives and it has at its core some of those unexplainable happenings which you have acknowledged do exist. I have used powers I can neither explain nor understand as part of my work. In the jungle and on the grasslands an off-worlder must guard his life with a stass belt if he goes unarmed. But I--any of my men--can walk unharmed if we obey the rules of our magic. Only Lumbrilo does other things which his forefathers did not. And he boasts that he can do more. So he has a growing following of those who believe--and those who fear."  "You want me to face him?"  The Chief Ranger's big hands closed upon the rim of the parapet as if they could exert enough pressure to crumble the hard stone. "I want you to see whether there is trickery in this. Trickery I can fight, for that there are weapons. But if Lumbrilo truly controls forces for which there is no name, then perhaps we must patch up an uneasy peace--or go down in defeat. And, off-worlder, I come from a line of warriors--we do not drink defeat easily!"  "That I also believe," Tau returned quietly. "Be sure, sir, if there is trickery in this man's magic and I can detect it, the secret shall be yours."  "Let us hope that so it shall be."  Subconsciously, Dane had always associated the practice of magic with darkness and the night. But the next morning the sun was high and hot when he made one of the party coming down to a second and larger walled terrace where the Hunters, Trackers, Guards and other followers of the Chief Ranger were assembled in irregular rows.  There was a low sound which was more a throb in the clear air about them, getting into a man's blood and pumping in rhythm there. Dane tracked the sound to its source: four large drums standing waist high before the men who tapped them delicately with the tips of all ten fingers.  The necklaces of claws and teeth about those dusky throats, the kilts of fringed hide, the crossed belts of brilliantly spotted or striped fur were in contrast to the very efficient and modern side arms each man wore, to the rest of the equipment sheathed and strapped at their belts.  There was a carved stool for the Chief Ranger, another for Captain Jellico. Dane and Tau settled themselves on the less comfortable seats of the terrace steps. Those tapping fingers increased their rate of beat, and the notes of the drums rose from the low murmur of hived bees to the mutter of mountain thunder still half a range away. A bird called from those inner courts of the palace from which the women never ventured.  Da--da--da--da.... Voices took up the thud-thud of the drums, the heads of the squatting men moved in a slow swing from side to side. Tau's hand closed about Dane's wrist and the younger man looked around, startled, to see that the medic's eyes were alight, that he was watching the assembly with the alertness of Sindbad approaching prey.  "Calculate the stowage space in Number One hold!"  That amazing order, delivered in a whisper, shocked Dane into obeying it. Number One hold ... there were three divisions now and the stowage was--He became aware that for a small space of time he had escaped the net being woven by the beat of the drum, the drone of voices, the nodding of heads. He moistened his lips. So that was how it worked! He had heard Tau speak often enough about self-hypnotism under such conditions, but this was the first time the meaning of it had been clear.  Two men were shuffling out of nowhere, wearing nothing on their dark bodies but calf-length kilts of tails, black tails with fluffy white tips, which swayed uniformly in time to their pacing feet. Their heads and shoulders were masked by beautifully cured and semi-mounted animal heads displaying half-open jaws with double pairs of curved fangs. The black-and-white striped fur, the sharply pointed ears, were neither canine nor feline, but a weird combination of the two.  Dane gabbled two trading formulas under his breath and tried to think of the relation of Samantine rock coinage to galactic credits. Only this time his defenses did not work. From between the two shuffling dancers padded something on four feet. The canine-feline creature was more than just a head; it was a loose-limbed, graceful body fully eight feet in length, and the red eyes in the prick-eared head were those of a confident killer. It walked without restraint, lazily, with arrogance, its white-tufted tail swinging. And when it reached the mid-point of the terrace, it flung up its head as if to challenge. But words issued from between those curved fangs, words which Dane might not understand but which undoubtedly held meaning for the men nodding in time to the hypnotic cadence of that da--da--da....  "Beautiful!" Tau spoke in honest admiration, his own eyes almost as feral as those of the talking beast as he leaned forward, his fists on his knees.  Now the animal was dancing also, its paws following the pace set by the masked attendants. It must be a man in an animal skin. But Dane could hardly believe that. The illusion was too perfect. His own hands went to the knife sheath at his belt. Out of deference to local custom they had left their stun rods in the palace, but a belt knife was an accepted article of apparel. Dane slid the blade out surreptitiously, setting its point against the palm of his hand and jabbing painfully. This was another of Tau's answers for breaking a spell. But the white and black creature continued to dance; there was no blurring of its body lines into those of a human being.  It sang on in a high-pitched voice, and Dane noted that those of the audience nearest the stools where Asaki and the captain were seated now watched the Chief Ranger and the space officer. He felt Tau tense beside him.  "Trouble coming...." The warning from Tau was the merest thread of sound. Dane forced himself to look away from the swaying cat-dog, to watch instead the singers who were now furtively eying their lord and his guest. The Terran knew that there were feudal bonds between the Ranger and his men. But suppose this was a showdown between Lumbrilo and Asaki--whose side would these men take?  He watched Captain Jellico's hand slide across his knee, his fingers drop in touching distance of knife hilt. And the hand of the Chief Ranger, hanging lax at his side, suddenly balled into a fist.  "So!" Tau expelled the word as a hiss. He moved with sure-footed speed. Now he passed between the stools to confront the dancing cat-dog. Yet he did not look at that weird creature and its attendants. Instead his arms were flung high as if to ward off--or perhaps welcome--something on the mountain side as he shouted:  "_Hodi, eldama! Hodi!_"  As one, those on the terrace turned, looked up toward the slope. Dane was on his feet, holding his knife as he might a sword. Though of what use its puny length would be against that huge bulk moving in slow majesty toward them, he did not try to think.  Gray-dark trunk curled upward between great ivory tusks, ears went wide as ponderous feet crunched volcanic soil. Tau moved forward, his hands still upraised, clearly in greeting. That trunk touched skyward as if in salute to the man who could be crushed under one foot.  "_Hodi, eldama!_" For the second time Tau hailed the monster elephant and the trunk raised in silent greeting from one lord of an earth to another he recognized as an equal. Perhaps it had been a thousand years since man and elephant had stood so, and then there had been only war and death between them. Now there was peace and a current of power flowing from one to the other. Dane sensed this, saw the men on the terrace likewise drawing back from the unseen tie between the medic and the bull he had so clearly summoned.  Then Tau's upheld hands came together in a sharp clap and men held their breath in wonder. Where the great bull had stood there was nothing--except rocks in the sun.  As Tau swung around to face the cat-dog, that creature had no substance either. For he fronted no animal but a man, a small, lean man whose lips wrinkled back from his teeth in a snarl. His attendant priests fell back, leaving the spaceman and the witch doctor alone.  "Lumbrilo's magic is great," Tau said evenly. "I hail Lumbrilo of Khatka." His hand made the open-palmed salute of peace.  The snarl faded as the man brought his face under control. He stood naked, but he was clothed in inherit dignity. And there was power with that dignity, power and a pride before which even the more physically impressive Chief Ranger might have to give place.  "You have magic also, outlander," he replied. "Where walks this long-toothed shadow of yours now?"  "Where once the men of Khatka walked, Lumbrilo. For it was men of your blood who long, long past hunted this shadow of mine and made its body their prey."  "So that it now might have a blood debt to settle with us, outlander?"  "That you said, not I, man of power. You have shown us one beast, I have shown another. Who can say which of them is stronger when it issues forth from the shadows?"  Lumbrilo pattered forward, his bare feet making little sound on the stones of the terrace. Now he was only an arm's-length away from the medic.  "You have challenged me, off-world man." Was that a question or a statement? Dane wondered.  "Why should I challenge you, Lumbrilo? To each race its own magic. I come not to offer battle." His eyes held steady with the Khatkan's.  "You have challenged me." Lumbrilo turned away and then looked back over his shoulder. "The strength you depend upon may become a broken staff, off-worlder. Remember my words in the time when shadows become substance, and substance the thinnest of shadows!"     III   "You are truly a man of power!"  Tau shook his head in answer to that outburst from Asaki.  "Not so, sir. Your Lumbrilo is a man of power. I drew upon his power and you saw the results."  "Deny it not! What we saw never walked this world."  Tau slung the strap of a trail bag over his shoulder. "Sir, once men of your blood, men who bred your race, hunted the elephant. They took his tusks for their treasure, feasted upon his flesh--yes, and died beneath the trampling of his feet when they were unlucky or unwary. So there is that within you which can even now be awakened to remember _eldama_ in his might when he was king of the herd and need fear nothing save the spears and cunning of small, weak men. Lumbrilo had already awakened your minds to see what he willed you to see."  "How does he do this?" asked the other simply. "Is it magic that we see not Lumbrilo but a lion before us?"  "He weaves his spell with the drums, with the chant, by the suggestion his mind imposes upon yours. And, having woven his spell, he cannot limit it to just the picture he suggests if ancient racial memories raise another. I merely used the tools of Lumbrilo to show you yet another picture your people once knew well."  "And in so doing made an enemy." Asaki stood before a rack of very modern weapons. Now he made his selection, a silver tube with a stock curved to fit a man's shoulder. "Lumbrilo will not forget."  Tau laughed shortly. "No, but then I have merely done as you wished, have I not, sir? I have focused on myself the enmity of a dangerous man, and now you hope I shall be forced, in self-defense, to remove him from your path."  The Khatkan turned slowly, resting the weapon across his forearm. "I do not deny that, spaceman."  "Then matters here are indeed serious--"  "They are so serious," Asaki interrupted, speaking not only to Tau but to the other off-worlders as well, "that what happens now may mean the end of the Khatka that I know. Lumbrilo is the most dangerous game I have faced in a lifetime as a hunter. He goes, or we draw his fangs--or else all that I am, all I have labored here to build, will be swept away. To preserve this I will use any weapon."  "And I am now your weapon, which you hope will be as successful as that needler you are carrying." Tau laughed again, without much humor. "Let us hope I shall prove as effective."  Jellico moved out of the shadows. It was just after dawn, and the grayness of the vanishing night still held in the corners of the armory. Deliberately he took his own stand before the arms racks and chose a short-barreled blaster. Only when its butt was cupped in his hand did he glance at his host.  "We came guesting, Asaki. We have eaten salt and bread under this roof."  "On my body and my blood it is," returned the Khatkan grimly. "I shall go down to the blackness of Sabra before you do, if the flames of death are against us." From his belt he flipped loose his knife and offered the hilt to Jellico. "My body for a wall between you and the dark, Captain. But also understand this: to me, what I do now is greater than the life of any one man. Lumbrilo and the evil behind him must be rooted out. There was no trickery in my invitation!"  They stood eye to eye, equal in height, in authority of person, and that indefinable something which made them both masters in their own different worlds. Then Jellico's hand went out, his fingertip flicked the hilt of the bared blade.  "There was no trickery," he conceded. "I knew that your need was great when you came to the _Queen_."  Since both the captain and Tau appeared to accept the situation, Dane, not quite understanding it all, was prepared to follow their lead. And for the moment they had nothing more in plan than to visit the Zoboru preserve.  They went by flitter--Asaki, one of his Hunter pilots, and the three from the _Queen_--lifting over the rim of mountains behind the fortress-palace and speeding north with the rising sun a flaming ball to the east. Below, the country was stark--rocks and peaks, deep purple shadows marking the veins of crevices. But that was swiftly behind and they were over a sea of greens, many shades of green, with yellow, blue, even red cutting into the general verdant carpet of treetops. Another chain of heights and then open land, swales of tall grass already burnt yellow by the steady sun. There was a river here, a crazy, twisted stream coiling nearly back upon itself at times.  Once more broken land, land so ravished by prehistoric volcanic action that it was a grotesque nightmare of erosion-whittled outcrops and mesas. Asaki pointed to the east. There was a dark patch widening out into a vast wedge.  "The swamp of Mygra. It has not yet been explored."  "You could air map it," Tau began.  The Chief Ranger was frowning. "Four flitters have been lost trying that. Com reports fail when they cross that last mountain ridge eastward. There is some sort of interference which we do not yet understand. Mygra is a place of death; later we may be able to travel along its fringe and then you shall see. Now--" He spoke to the pilot in his own tongue and the flitter pointed up-nose at an angle as they climbed over the highest peak they had yet seen in this mountainous land, to reach at last a country of open grass dotted with small forest stands. Jellico nodded approvingly.  "Zoboru?"  "Zoboru," Asaki assented. "We shall go up to the northern end of the preserve. I wish to show you the roosts of the fastals. This is their nesting season and the sight is one you will long remember. But we shall take an eastern course; I have two Ranger stations to check on the way."  It was after they left the second station that the flitter swung farther out eastward, again climbing over the chain of heights to sight one of the newly discovered wonders the staff at the last station had reported--a crater lake.  And the flitter skimmed down across water which was a rich emerald in hue, filling the crater from one rock wall to the other with no beach at the foot of those precipitant cliffs. As the machine arose to clear the far wall, Dane tensed. One of his duties aboard the _Queen_ was flitter pilot for planetwise trips. And ever since they had taken off that morning he had unconsciously flown with the Khatkan pilot, anticipating each change or adjustment of the controls. Now he felt that sluggish response to the other's lift signal, and instinctively his own hand went out to adjust a power feed lever.  They made the rise, were well above the danger of the cliff wall. But the machine was not responding properly. Dane did not need to watch the pilot's swiftly moving hands to guess that they were in trouble. And his slight concern deepened into something else as the flitter began to drop nose again. In front of him, Captain Jellico shifted uneasily, and Dane knew that he, too, was alerted.  Now the pilot had plunged the power adjuster to the head against the control board. But the nose of the flitter acted as if it were overweighted or magnetically attracted by the rocks below. The best efforts of the man flying it could not keep it level. They were being drawn earthward, and all the pilot could do only delayed the inevitable crack-up. The Khatkan was turning the machine north to avoid what lay below, for here a long arm of the Mygra swamp clasped about the foot of the mountain.  The Chief Ranger spoke into the mike of the com unit while the pilot continued to fight against the pull which was bringing them down. Now the small machine was below the level of the volcanic peak which cradled the lake, and the mountain lay between them and the preserve.  Asaki gave a muffled exclamation, slapped the com box, spoke more sharply into the mike. It was apparent he was not getting the results he wanted. Then with a quick glance about he snapped an order:  "Strap in!"  His Terran companions had already buckled the wide webbing belts intended to save them from crash shock. Dane saw the pilot push the button to release fend cushions. In spite of his pounding heart, a small fraction of his brain recognized the other's skill as the Khatkan took a course to bring them down on a relatively level patch of sand and gravel.  Dane raised his head from the shelter of his folded arms. The Chief Ranger was busy with the pilot, who lay limply against the controls. Captain Jellico and Tau were already pulling at the buckles of their protective crash belts. But one look at the front of the flitter told Dane that it would not take to the air again without extensive repairs. Its nose was bent up and back, obscuring the forward view completely. However, the pilot had made a miraculously safe landing considering the terrain.  Ten minutes later, the pilot restored to consciousness and the gash in his head bandaged, they held a council of war.  "The com was off, too. I did not have a chance to report before the crash," Asaki put the situation straightly. "And our exploring parties have not yet mapped this side of the range; it has a bad reputation because of the swamp."  Jellico measured the heights now to their west with resigned eyes. "Looks as if we climb."  "Not here," the Chief Ranger corrected him. "There is no passing through the crater lake region on foot. We must travel south along the edge of the mountain area until we do find a scalable way into the preserve region."  "You seem very certain we are not going to be rescued if we stay right here," Tau observed. "Why?"  "Because I'm inclined to believe that any flitter that tries to reach us may run into the same trouble. Also, they have no com fix on us. It will be at least a day or more before they will even begin to count us missing, and then they will have the whole northern portion of the preserve to comb; there are not enough men here--I can give you a multitude of reasons, Medic."  "One of which might be sabotage?" demanded Jellico.  Asaki shrugged. "Perhaps. I am not loved in some quarters. But there may also be something fatal to flitters here as there is over Mygra. We thought the crater lake district safely beyond the swamp influence, but it may not be so."  But you took the chance of traveling over it, Dane thought, though he did not comment aloud. Was this another of the Chief Ranger's attempts to involve them in some private trouble of his own? Though to deliberately smash up a flitter and set them all afoot in this wilderness was a pretty drastic move.  Asaki had started to unload emergency supplies from the flitter. They each had a trail bag for a pack. But when the pilot staggered over to pull out a set of stass belts and Jellico began to uncoil them, the Chief Ranger shook his head.  "With the feeder beam shut off by the mountains, I fear those will no longer work."  Jellico tossed one on the crumpled nose of the flitter and punched its button with the tip of the needler barrel. Then he threw a rock at the dangling belt. The stone landed, taking the wide protective band with it to the ground. That force field which should have warded off the missile was not working.  "Oh, fine!" Tau opened his trail bag to pack concentrates. Then he smiled crookedly. "We aren't signed in for killing licenses, sir. Do you pay our fines if we are forced to shoot a hole through something that disputes the right of way?"  To Dane's surprise, the Chief Ranger laughed. "You are off preserve now, Medic Tau. The rules do not cover wild land. But I would suggest we now hunt a cave before nightfall."  "Lions?" asked Jellico.  Dane, remembering the black and white beast Lumbrilo had presented, did not enjoy that thought. They had--his gaze went from man to man checking weapons--the needler Asaki carried, and another the pilot had slung by its carrying strap over his shoulder. Tau and the captain both were armed with blasters and he had a fire ray and a force blade, both considered small arms but deadly enough perhaps even to dampen a lion's enthusiasm for the chase.  "Lions, graz, rock apes," Asaki fastened the mouth of his trail bag. "All are hunters or killers. The graz send out scouts, and they are big and formidable enough to have no enemies. Lions hunt with intelligence and skill. Rock apes are dangerous, but luckily they cannot keep silent when they scent their prey and so give one warning."  As they climbed up-slope from the flitter, Dane, looking back, saw that perhaps Asaki was right in his belief that they had better try to help themselves rather than wait for rescue. Putting aside the excuse of fearing another crack-up, the wrecked flitter made no outstanding mark on the ground. The higher they climbed, the less it could be distinguished from the tumble of rocks about it.  He had lagged a little behind and, when he hurried to catch up, found Jellico standing with his distance vision lenses to his eyes, directing them toward that shadow marking the swamp. As the younger spaceman reached him, the captain lowered the glasses and spoke:  "Take your knife, Thorson, and hold it close to that rock--over there." He pointed to a rounded black knob protruding from the soil a little off their path.  Dane obeyed, only to have the blade jerk in his hand. And when he loosened his hold in amazement, the steel slapped tight against the stone.  "Magnetic!"  "Yes. Which might explain our crash. Also this." Jellico held out a field compass to demonstrate that its needle had gone completely mad.  "We can use the mountain range itself for a guide," Dane said with more confidence than he felt.  "True enough. But we may have trouble when we head west again." Jellico let the lenses swing free on their cord about his neck. "If we were wrecked on purpose"--his mouth tightened and the old blaster burn on his cheek stretched as did his jaw set--"then someone is going to answer a lot of questions--and fast!"  "The Chief Ranger, sir?"  "I don't know. I just don't know!" The captain grunted as he adjusted his pack and started on.  If fortune had failed them earlier, she smiled on them now. Asaki discovered a cave before sundown, located not too far from a mountain stream. The Ranger sniffed the air before that dark opening as the Hunter pilot shed his equipment and crept forward on his hands and knees, his head up and his nostrils expanding as he, too, tested the scent from the cave mouth.  Scent? It was closer to a stench, and one ripe enough to turn the stomach of an off-worlder. But the Hunter glanced back over his shoulder and nodded reassuringly.  "Lion. But old. Not here within five days at least."  "Well enough. And even old lion scent will keep away rock apes. We'll clean some and then we can rest undisturbed," was his superior's comment.  The cleaning was easy for the brittle bedding of dried bracken and grass the beast had left burned quickly, cleansing with both fire and smoke. When they raked the ashes out with branches, Asaki and Nymani brought in handfuls of leaves which they crumpled and threw on the floor, spreading an aromatic odor which banished most of the foulness.  Dane, at the stream with the canteens to fill, chanced upon a small pool where there was a spread of smooth yellow sand. Knowing well the many weird booby traps one might stumble into on a strange world, the Terran prospected carefully, stirring up the stand with a stick. Sighting not so much as a water insect or a curious fish, he pulled off his boots, rolled up his breeches and waded in. The water was cool and refreshing, though he dared not drink it until the purifier was added. Then, with the filled canteens knotted together by their straps, he put on his boots and climbed to the cave where Tau waited with water tablets.  Half an hour later Dane sat cross-legged by the fire, turning a spit strung with three small birds Asaki had brought in. One foot closer to the heat began to tingle and he eased off his boot; his cramped toes suddenly seeming to have doubled in size. He was staring wide-eyed at these same toes, puffed, red, and increasingly painful to the touch, when Nymani squatted beside him, inspected his foot closely, and ordered him to take off his other boot.  "What is it?" Dane found that shedding the other boot was a minor torture in itself.  Nymani was cutting tiny splinters, hardly thicker than a needle, from a stick.  "Sand worm--lays eggs in flesh. We burn them out or you have bad foot."  "Burn them out!" Dane echoed, and then swallowed as he watched Nymani advance a splinter to the fire.  "Burn them," the Khatkan repeated firmly. "Burn tonight, hurt some tomorrow; all well soon. No burn--very bad."  Dane ruefully prepared to pay the consequences of his first brush with the unpleasant surprises Khatka had to offer.     IV   Dane regarded his throbbing feet morosely. Nymani's operations with burning splinters had been hard to take, but he had endured them without disgracing himself before the Khatkans, who appeared to regard such a mishap as just another travel incident. Now, with Tau's salve soothing the worst of the after affects, the Terran was given time to reflect upon his own stupidity and the fact that he might now prove a drag on the whole party the next morning.  "That's queer...."  Dane was startled out of the contemplation of his misery to see the medic on his knees before their row of canteens, the vial of water purifier held to the firelight for a closer inspection.  "What's the matter?"  "We must have hit with a pretty hard thump back there. Some of these pills are powder! Have to guess about the portion to add." With the tip of his knife blade Tau scraped a tiny amount of pill fragments into each waiting canteen. "That should do it. But if the water tastes a little bitter, don't let it bother you."  Bitter water, Dane thought, trying to flex his still swollen toes, was going to be the least of his worries in the morning. But he determined that his boots should go on at daybreak, and he would keep on his feet as long as the others did, no matter how much it cost him.  And when they set out shortly after daybreak, wanting to move as far as they could before the heat hours when they must rest, the going was not too bad. Dane's feet were tender to the touch, but he could shuffle along at the tail of the procession with only Nymani playing rear guard behind him.  Jungle lay before them and bush knives began to swing, clearing their path. Dane took his turn with the rest at that chore, thankful that the business of cutting their way through that mass of greenery slowed them to a pace he could match--if not in comfort, then by willpower.  But the sand worms were not the only troubles one could encounter on Khatka. Within an hour Captain Jellico stood sweating and speaking his mind freely in the native tongues of five different planets while Tau and Nymani worked as a team with skinning knives. They were not flaying the spaceman, but they came near to that in places as they worried a choice selection of tree thorns out of his arm and shoulder. The captain had been unfortunate enough to trip and fall into the embrace of a very unfriendly bush.  Dane inspected a fallen tree for evidence of inimical wild life, and then rested his blanket between him and it as a protecting cushion before he sat down. These trees were not the towering giants of the true forests, but rather oversized bushes which had been made into walls by twined vines. Brilliant bursts of flowers were splotches of vivid color, and the attendant insect life was altogether too abundant. Dane tried to tally his immunity shots and hoped for the best. At the moment he wondered why anyone would want to visit Khatka, let alone pay some astronomical sum for the privilege. Though he could also guess that the plush safari arranged for a paying client might be run on quite different lines from their own present trek.  How _could_ a tracker find his way through this? With the compasses playing crazy tricks into the bargain! Jellico knew that the compasses were off, yet the captain had followed Asaki's lead without question, so he must trust the Ranger's forest craft. But Dane wished they were clear on the mountain side again.  Time had little meaning in that green gloom. But when they worked through to meet rock walls again, the sun said it was well into the after part of the day. They sheltered for a breather under the drooping limbs of one of the last trees.  "Amazing!" Jellico, his torn arm in a sling across his chest, came down-slope from the higher point where he had been using the distance lenses. "We struck straight across and cut off about ten miles by that jungle jog. Now I believe all that I've heard of your people's ability to cross wilderness and not lose their built in 'riding beams,' sir. With the compasses out, I'll admit I've been nourishing a healthy set of doubts."  Asaki laughed. "Captain, I do not question your ability to flit from world to world, or how you have learned to set up trade with strange humans and non-humans alike. To each his own mystery. On Khatka every boy before he becomes a man must learn to navigate the jungle, and with no instruments to help him, only what lies in here." He touched his thumb to his forehead. "So through generations we have developed our homing instincts. Those who did not, also did not live to father others who might have had the same lack. We are hounds who can run on a scent, and we are migrators who have better than a compass within our own bodies."  "Now we take to climbing again?" Tau surveyed the way before them critically.  "Not at this hour. That sun on the upward slopes can cook a man's skin were he to touch any rock. We wait...."  Waiting for the Khatkans was a chance to sleep. They curled up on their light blankets. But the three spacemen were restless. Dane would have liked to have taken off his boots, but feared he could not replace them; and he could tell from the way the captain shifted his position that Jellico was in pain too. Tau sat quietly, staring at nothing Dane could see, unless it was a tall rock thrust out of the slope like a finger pointing skyward.  "What color is that rock?"  Surprised, Dane gave the stony finger closer attention. To him it was the same color as most of the other rocks, a weathered black which in certain lights appeared to carry a brownish film.  "Black, or maybe dark brown?"  Tau looked past him to Jellico. The captain nodded.  "I'd agree with that."  Tau cupped his hands over his eyes for a moment and his lips moved as if he were counting. Then he took his hands away and stared up-slope. Dane watched the medic's eyelids blink slowly. "Nothing but black or brown?" Tau pressed.  "No." Jellico supported his injured arm upon his knees, leaning forward, as intent upon the designated rock as if he expected it to assume some far more startling appearance.  "Queer," Tau said to himself, and then added briskly, "You're right, of course. That sun can play tricks with one's eyes."  Dane continued to watch the finger rock. Maybe strong sunlight could play tricks, but he could see nothing odd about that rough lump. And since the captain asked no questions of Tau, he did not quite want to either.  It was perhaps a half-hour later, and the medic and Jellico had both succumbed to the quiet, the heat, and their own fatigue, when Dane did sight a movement up-slope. The throbbing in his feet was worse now that he had nothing to occupy his mind but his own troubles, and he was sitting facing the finger rock.  Was that what Tau had seen earlier? That quick movement around the side of the rough pillar? But if so, why the question of color? There it was again! And now, centering all his attention on that one point, the Terran picked out the outline of a head--a head grotesque enough to be something conjured out of Lumbrilo's sorcerer's imagination. Had Dane not seen its like among the tri-dee prints in Captain Jellico's collection, he would have believed that his eyes were playing tricks.  It was a bullet-shaped head, embellished by two out-sized prick ears, the hair-tufted pointed tips of which projected well above the top of the skull. Round eyes were set deeply in sunken pits. The mouth was a swinish snout from which lolled a purple tongue, though the rest of that gargoyle head was very close in color to the rock against which it half rested.  Dane had no doubts that the rock ape was spying upon the small camp. Having heard tales of those semi-intelligent animals--the most intelligent native creatures of Khatka--most of which were concerned with their more malignant characteristics, Dane was alarmed. That lurker could be an advance scout of some pack. And a pack of rock apes, if able to surprise their prey, were formidable opponents.  Asaki stirred, sat up. And that round head above turned to follow the Chief Ranger's every move.  "Above ... by the finger rock ... to the right...." Dane kept his voice close to a whisper. When he saw the sudden constriction of muscle across the Khatkan's bare shoulders, he knew that the other had heard and understood.  Only, if Asaki had spotted the rock ape, he did not betray his knowledge. The Khatkan got lithely to his feet. Then one of those feet stirred Nymani into the instant wakefulness of the wilderness-trained man.  Dane slid his hand about the bole of the tree and touched Jellico, watched the captain's gray eyes open with a similar awareness. Asaki picked up his needler. Weapon in hand, he whirled and fired almost in one connected movement. It was the fastest shot Dane had ever seen.  The gargoyle head lifted away from the rock, and then turned to one side as its body, somehow vaguely obscene in its resemblance to the human form, fell away, to sprawl limply down-slope.  Though the dead rock ape had not had a chance to give tongue, there came a cry from above, a coughing, deep-throated hawking. Down the steep incline bumped a round white ball, bouncing past the tumbled carcass of the ape, sailing up into the air, to strike and burst open a few feet away.  "Back!" With one arm Asaki sent Jellico, his nearest neighbor, tumbling back into the jungle. Then the Chief Ranger pumped a stream of needle rays into the remains of the ball. A shrill, sweet humming arose as red motes, vivid as molten copper in the sunlight, climbed on wings beating too fast to be seen.  The debris of the nest smoked into nothing. But no needle ray could hope to stop all the poisonous army issuing forth from it, fighting mad, to seek any warm-blooded creature within scenting distance. The men threw themselves into the brush, rolling in the thick mold of the vegetable decay on the ground, rubbing its moist plaster over their bodies in frantic haste.  Red-hot fire, far worse than any of the splinter torment Dane had undergone the night before, pierced between his shoulders. He rolled on his back, shoving himself along, both to kill the fire-wasp and coat the sting with cooling mold. Cries of pain told him that he was not the only sufferer, as all dug hands into the slimy stuff under them and slapped it over their faces and heads.  "Apes...." That half shout got through to alert the men on the jungle floor. True to their nature, the rock apes, now streaming downhill, were coughing their challenges, advertising their attack. And it was only that peculiarity of their species which saved their intended victims.  The apes came forward, partially erect, at a shambling run. The first two, bulls close to six feet, went down under fire from Asaki's needler. A third somehow escaped, swerving to the left, and came bounding at an angle toward Dane. The Terran jerked free his force blade as that swine snout split wide to show greenish tusks and the horrible stench of the creature's body made him gasp.  A taloned paw clawed at him eagerly, slipped from his slime-covered body just as he brought the force blade up. Foul breath coughed in his face and he stumbled back as the heavy body of the ape crashed against him, cut in half by the weapon. To Dane's sickened horror the paws still clawed for him, the fangs still gnashed as he rolled free of the mangled body and somehow got to his feet.  The roar of a blaster, of two blasters, drowned out the clamor of the apes as Dane drew his fire ray, set his shoulders against a tree bole and prepared to fight it out. He fired, saw a smaller and more nimble enemy go down screeching. Then there were none left on their shaggy feet, though some on the ground dragged themselves forward, still striving to reach the men.  Dane slapped a fire-wasp from his leg. He was glad of the support of the tree at his back as the smell of the ape's blood drenching him from chest level down, and the mess on the ground, made his stomach churn.  When he could control his retching, he straightened. To his relief he saw that all the others were on their feet, apparently unharmed. But Tau, catching sight of the younger spaceman, gasped and started for him.  "Dane! What did they do?"  His junior laughed a little hysterically. "Not mine...." He swabbed with a handful of grass at his bloodied breeches and blundered on into the sunlight.  Nymani found them a foam-flecked stream below a miniature falls where the swift current prevented the lurking of sand worms. They stripped eagerly, cleaning first themselves and then their fouled clothing while Tau tended the wealth of fire-wasp stings. There was little he could do to relieve the swelling and pain, until Asaki produced a reed-like plant which, chopped in sections, yielded a sticky purple liquid that dried on the skin as a tar gum--the native remedy. So, glued and plastered, they climbed away from the water and prepared to spend the night in a hollow between two leaning rocks, certainly not as snug as the cave but a fortress of sorts.  "And credit-happy space hoppers pay a fortune for an outing like this!" Tau commented bitterly, hunching well forward so that a certain stung portion of his anatomy would not come in contact with the rock beneath him.  "Hardly for this," Jellico replied, and Dane saw Nymani grin one-sidedly, his other cheek puffed and painted sticky purple.  "We do not always encounter apes and fire-wasps in the same day," supplied the Chief Ranger. "Also, guests at the preserves wear stass belts."  Jellico snorted. "I don't think you'd get any repeats from your clients otherwise! What do we meet tomorrow? A herd of graz on stampede, or something even more subtle and deadly?"  Nymani got up and walked a little way from their rock shelter. He turned down-slope and Dane saw his nostrils expand as they had when he had investigated the cave.  "Something is dead," he said slowly. "A very large something. Or else--"  Asaki strode down to join his men. He gave a curt nod and Nymani skidded on down the mountain side.  "What is it?" Jellico asked.  "It might be many things. There is one I hope it is not," was the Chief Ranger's somewhat evasive reply. "I will hunt a labbla--there was fresh spoor at the stream." He set off along their back trail to return a half hour later, the body of his kill slung across one shoulder. He was skinning it when Nymani trotted back.  "Well?"  "Death pit," supplied the Hunter.  "Poachers?" Jellico inquired.  Nymani nodded. Asaki continued his task, but there was a glint in his dark eyes as he butchered with sure and expert strokes. Then he glanced at the shadow extending beyond the rocks.  "I, too, would see," he told Nymani.  Jellico arose, and Dane, interested, followed. Some five minutes later none of them needed the native keenness of smell to detect the presence of some foulness ahead. The odor of corruption was almost tangible in the sultry air. And it grew worse until they stood on the edge of a pit. Dane retreated hurriedly. This was as bad as the battlefield of the rock apes. But the captain and the two Khatkans stood calmly assessing the slaughter left by the hide poachers.  "Glam, graz, hoodra," Jellico commented. "Tusks and hides--the full line of trade stuff."  Asaki, his expression bleak, stepped back from the pit. "Day old calves, old ones, females--all together. They kill wantonly and leave those they do not choose to pelt."  "Trail--" Nymani pointed eastward. "Leads to Mygra swamp."  "The swamps!" Asaki was shaken. "They must be mad!"  "Or know more about this country than your men do," Jellico corrected.  "If poachers can enter Mygra, then we can follow!"  But not now, Dane protested silently. Certainly Asaki did not mean that _they_ were to track outlaws into swamps the Khatkan had already labeled unexplored death traps!     V   Sitting up, Dane stared wide-eyed into the dark. A handful of glowing coals, guarded by rocks, was the center of their camp. He hunched up to that hardly knowing why he moved. His hands were shaking, his skin damp with sweat no heat produced. Yet, now that he was conscious of the night, the Terran could not remember the nightmare from which he had just awakened, though he was left with a growing apprehension which he could not define. What prowled out there in that dark? Walked the mountain side? Listened, spied and waited?  Dane half started to his feet as a form did move into the dim light of the fire. Tau stood there, regarding him with sober intensity.  "Bad dream?"  The younger man admitted to that with a nod, partly against his will.  "Well, you aren't the only one. Remember any of it?"  With an effort, Dane looked away from the encircling dark. It was as if the fear which had shaken him awake, now embodied, lurked right there.  "No." He rubbed sleep-smarting eyes.  "Neither did I," Tau remarked. "But both of 'em must have been jet-powered."  "I suppose one could expect to have nightmares after yesterday." Dane advanced the logical explanation, yet at the same time something deep inside him denied every word of it. He had known nightmares before; none of them had left this aftertaste. And he wanted no return of sleep tonight. Reaching to the pile of wood he fed the fire as Tau settled down beside him.  "There is something else...." the medic began, and then fell silent. Dane did not press him. The younger man was too busy fighting a growing desire to whirl and aim the fire ray into that darkness, to catch in its withering blast that lurking thing he could _feel_ padded there, biding its time.  Despite his efforts Dane did drowse again before morning, waking unrefreshed, and, to his secret dismay, with no lessening of his odd dislike for the country about them.  Asaki did not suggest that they trail the poachers into the morass of Mygra. Instead the Chief Ranger was eager to press on in the opposite direction, find a way over the range to the preserve where he could assemble a punitive force to deal with the outlaws. So they began an upward climb which took them away from the dank heat of the lowlands, into the parched blaze of the sunbaked ledges above.  The sun was bright, far too bright, and there were few shadows left. Yet Dane, stopping to drink sparingly from his canteen, could not lose that sense of eyes upon him, of being tracked. Rock apes? Cunning as those beasts were, it was against their nature to trail in utter silence, to be able to carry through a long-term project. Lion, perhaps?  He noted that Nymani and Asaki took turns at rear guard today, and that each was alert. Yet, oddly enough, none of them mentioned the uneasiness they must all share.  They had a dry climb, finding no mountain stream to renew their water supply. All being experienced in wilderness travel, they made a mouthful of liquid go a long way. When the party halted slightly before midday, canteens were still half full.  "_Haugh!_"  They jerked up, hands on weapons. A rock ape, its hideous body clearly seen here, capered, coughed, spat. Asaki fired from the hip and the thing screeched, clawed at its chest where the dark blood spewed out, and raced for them. Nymani cut the beast down and they waited tensely for the attack of the thing's tribe, which should have followed the abortive lunge on the part of their scout. But there was nothing--neither sound nor movement.  What did follow froze them all momentarily. That mangled body began to move again, drew itself together, crawled toward them. Dane knew that it was impossible that the creature could live with such wounds. Yet the beast advanced, its head lolling on its hunched shoulders so that the eyes were turned blindly up to the full glare of the sun, while it crawled to reach the man it could not see.  "Demon!" Nymani dropped his needler, shrank back against the rocks.  As the thing advanced, before their eyes the impossible happened. Those gaping wounds closed, the head straightened on the almost invisible neck, the eyes glared once more with life, and slaver dripped from the swine snout.  Jellico caught up the needler Nymani had dropped. With a coolness Dane envied, the captain shot. And for the second time the rock ape collapsed, torn to ribbons.  Nymani screamed, and Dane tried to choke back his own cry of horrified protest. The dead thing put on life for the second time, crawled, got somehow to its feet, healed itself, and came on. Asaki, his face greenish-pale, stepped out stiffly as if each step he took was forced by torture. He had dropped his needler. Now he caught up a rock as large as his own head, raised it high with arms on which the muscles stood out like ropes. He hurled the stone, and Dane heard as well as saw the missile go home. The rock ape fell for the third time.  When one of those taloned paws began to move again, Nymani broke. He ran, his screams echoing thinly in the air, as the thing lurched up, the gory mess of its head weaving about. If his feet would have obeyed him, Dane might have followed the Khatkan. As it was, he drew his ray and aimed it at that shambling thing. Tau struck up the barrel.  The medic's face was livid; there was the same horror in his eyes. But he moved out to front that monster.  A spot of shadow coalesced on the ground, deepened in hue, took on substance. Crouched low facing the rock ape, its haunches quivering for a deadly spring, narrowed green eyes holding on its prey, was a black leopard.  The tiny forward and backward movements of its body steadied, and it arched through the air, brought down the ape. A pitting, snarling tangle rolled across the slope--and was gone!  Asaki's hands shook as he drew them down his sweating face. Jellico readied a second clip in the needler mechanically. But Tau was swaying so that Dane leaped to take the shock of the other's weight as he collapsed. Only for a moment did the medic hang so, then he struggled to stand erect.  "Magic?" Jellico's voice, as controlled as ever, broke the silence.  "Mass hallucination," Tau corrected him. "Very strong."  "How!" Asaki swallowed and began again. "How was it done?"  The medic shook his head. "Not by the usual methods, that is certain. And it worked on us--on me--when we weren't conditioned. I don't understand that!"  Dane could hardly believe it yet. He watched Jellico stride to where the tangle of struggling beasts had rolled, saw him examine bare ground on which no trace of the fight remained. They must accept Tau's explanation; it was the only sane one.  Asaki's features were suddenly convulsed with a rage so stark that Dane realized how much a veneer was the painfully built civilization of Khatka.  "_Lumbrilo!_" The Chief Ranger made of that name a curse. Then with a visible effort he controlled his emotions and came to Tau, looming over the slighter medic almost menacingly.  "How?" he demanded for the second time.  "I don't know."  "He will try again?"  "Not the same perhaps--"  But Asaki had already grasped the situation, was looking ahead.  "We shall not know," he breathed, "what is real, what is not."  "There is also this," Tau warned. "The unreal can kill the believer just as quickly as the real!"  "That I know also. It has happened too many times lately. If we could only find out how! Here are no drums, no singing--none of the tricks to tangle a man's mind that he usually uses to summon his demons. So without Lumbrilo, without his witch tools, how does he make us see what is not?"  "That we must discover and speedily, sir. Or else we shall be lost among the unreal and the real."  "You also have the power. You can save us!" Asaki protested.  Tau drew his arm across his face. Very little of the normal color had returned to his thin, mobile features. He still leaned against Dane's supporting arm.  "A man can do only so much, sir. To battle Lumbrilo on his own ground is exhausting and I can not fight so very often."  "But will he not also be exhausted?"  "I wonder...." Tau gazed beyond the Khatkan to the barren ground where leopard and rock ape had ceased to be. "This magic is a tricky thing, sir. It builds and feeds upon a man's own imagination and inner fears. Lumbrilo, having triggered ours, need not strive at all, but let us ourselves raise that which will attack us."  "Drugs?" demanded Jellico.  Tau gave a start sufficient to take him out of Dane's loose hold. His hand went to the packet of aid supplies which was his own care, his eyes round with wonder and then shrewdly alert.  "Captain, we disinfected those thorn punctures of yours. Thorson, your foot salve.... But, no, I didn't use anything--"  "You forget, Craig, we all had scratches after that fight with the apes."  Tau sat down on the ground. With feverish haste he unsealed his medical supplies, laid out some containers. Then delicately he opened each, examined its contents closely by eye, by smell, and two by taste. When he was done he shook his head.  "If these have been in any way meddled with, I would need laboratory analysis to detect it. And I don't believe that Lumbrilo could hide traces of his work so cleverly. Or has he been off-planet? Had much to do with off-worlders?" he asked the Chief Ranger.  "By the nature of his position he is forbidden to space voyage, to have any close relationship with any off-worlder. I do not think, medic, he would choose your healing substances for his mischief. There would only be chance to aid him then in producing the effects he wants. Though there is often call for first aid in travel, he could not be _certain_ you would use any of your drugs on this trip to the preserve."  "And Lumbrilo _was_ certain. He threatened something such as this," Jellico reminded them.  "So it would be something which we would all use, which we had to depend upon...."  "The water!" Dane had been holding his own canteen ready to drink. But as that possible explanation dawned in his mind, he smelled instead of tasted the liquid sloshing inside. There was no odor he could detect. But he remembered Tau commenting on the powdered purifier pills at their first camp.  "That's it!" Tau dug further into his kit, brought out the vial of white powder with its grainy lumps. Pouring a little into the palm of his hand he smelled it, touched it with the tip of his tongue. "Purifier and something else," he reported. "It could be one of half a dozen drugs, or some native stuff from here which we've never classified."  "True. There are drugs we have found here." Asaki scowled down at the green mat of jungle. "So our water is poisoned?"  "Do you always purify it?" Tau asked the Chief Ranger. "Surely during the centuries since your ancestors landed on Khatka you must have adapted to native water. You couldn't have lived otherwise. We must use the purifier, but must you?"  "There is water and water." Asaki shook his own canteen, his scowl growing fiercer as the gurgle from its depths was heard. "From springs on the other side of the mountains we drink--yes. But over here, this close to the Mygra swamps, we have not done so. We may have to chance it."  "Do you think we are literally poisoned?" Jellico bored directly to the heart of their private fears.  "None of us have been drinking too heavily," Tau observed thoughtfully. "And I don't believe Lumbrilo had outright killing in mind. How long the effect will last I have no way of telling."  "If we saw one rock ape," Dane wondered, "why didn't we see others? And why here and now?"  "That!" Tau pointed ahead on the trail Asaki had picked for their ascent. For a long moment Dane could see nothing of any interest there and then he located it--a finger of rock. It did not point directly skyward this time, in fact it slanted so that its tip indicated their back trail. Yet in outline the spire was very similar to that outcrop from which the real rock ape had charged them the day before.  Asaki exclaimed in his own tongue and slapped his hand hard against the stock of the needler.  "We saw that and so again we saw an ape also! Had earlier we been charged by graz or jumped by a lion in such a place, then again we would have been faced by graz or lion here!"  Captain Jellico gave a bark of laughter colored only by the most sardonic humor. "Clever enough. He merely leaves it to us to select our own ghost and then repeat the performance in the next proper setting. I wonder how many rocks shaped like that one there are in these mountains? And how long will a rock ape continue to pop out from behind each one we do find?"  "Who knows? But as long as we drink this water we're going to continue to have trouble; I feel safe in promising that," Tau replied. He put the vial of doctored purifier into a separate pocket of his medical kit. "It may be a problem of how long we can go without water."  "Perhaps," Asaki said softly. "Only not all the water on Khatka comes running in streams."  "Fruit?" Tau asked.  "No, trees. Lumbrilo is not a hunter, nor could he be certain when and where his magic would go to work. Unless the flitter was deliberately sabotaged, he was planning for us to use our canteens in the preserve. That is lion country and there are long distances between springs. This is jungle below us and there is a source there I think we can safely tap. But first I must find Nymani and prove to him that this is truly deviltry of a sort, but not demon inspired."  He was gone, running lightly down-slope in the direction his hunter had taken, and Dane spoke to Captain Jellico.  "What's this about water in trees, sir?"  "There is a species of tree here, not too common, with a thickened trunk. It stores water during the rainy season to live on in the hot months. Since we are in the transition period between rains, we could tap it--if we locate one of the trees. How about that, Tau? Dare we drink that without a purifier?"  "Probably a choice of two evils, sir. But we have had our preventive shots. Personally, I'd rather battle disease than take a chance on a mind-twisting drug. You can go without water just so long...."  "I'd like to have a little talk with Lumbrilo," remarked Jellico, the mildness in his voice very deceptive.  "I'm _going_ to have a little talk with Lumbrilo, if and when we see him again!" promised Tau.  "What are our chances, sir?" Dane asked. He screwed the cap back on his canteen, his mouth feeling twice as dry since he knew he dared not drink.  "Well, we've faced gambles before." Tau sealed the medical kit. "I'd like to see one of those trees before sundown. And I don't want to face another pointed rock today!"  "Why the leopard?" asked Jellico reflectively. "Another case of using flame to fight fire? But Lumbrilo wasn't among those present to be impressed."  Tau rubbed his hand across his forehead. "I don't really know, sir. Maybe I could have made the ape vanish without a counter projection, but I don't think so. With these hallucinations it is better to battle one vision against another for the benefit of those involved. And I can't even tell you why I selected a leopard--it just flashed into mind as about the fastest and most deadly animal fighter I could recall at that moment."  "You'd better work out a good list of such fighters." Jellico's grim humor showed again. "I can supply a few if you need them. Not that I don't share your hope we won't see any more trigger rocks. Here comes Asaki with his wandering boy."  The Chief Ranger was half-leading, half-supporting his hunter, and Nymani seemed only half-conscious. Tau got to his feet and hurried to meet them. It would appear that their search for the water tree would be delayed.     VI   They withdrew to a spot hacked from the edge of the jungle, leaving a screen of green between them and the traitorous up-slope. But within the few hours of daylight left them, it was proven that Asaki had been overly optimistic in his hopes of discovering a water tree. They were now in a narrow tongue of land between the range and the swamps, and this territory was limited. Nymani, still shaken, was of little help, and the spacemen did not dare to strike out into unexplored land alone.  So they mouthed dry concentrates and dared not drink. Dane was tempted to pour out the liquid in his canteen. Water so close to hand was a continual torment. And, now that they were away from the heights and the possibility of more finger-shaped rocks, surely the threat in that moisture was small in comparison to the needs of his body. Only that caution which was drilled into every Free Trader supplied a brake to his thirst.  Jellico drew the back of his hand across cracked lips. "Suppose we should draw lots--some of us drink, one or two not. Could we manage that way until we were over the mountains?"  "I wouldn't want to chance it, unless we are left with no other choice. There is no way of telling how long the drug works. Frankly, right now I'm not even sure I could detect a hallucination for very long under these conditions," was Tau's discouraging verdict.  If any of them slept that night, they did so only in snatches. The apprehension which had come with the previous night was back, intensified, and that lurking, indefinable fear rode them hard.  They were shaken out of their private terrors shortly after dawn. There were always sounds to be heard in the jungle: the cries of unseen birds, the crash of some tree eaten alive by parasitic sapping. But what broke now was no bird call, no isolated tree falling. A trumpeting roar, the crackling smash of vegetation, heralded a real menace. Asaki spun to face northward, though there was nothing to be seen there except the unshaken wall of the jungle.  "Graz! Graz on stampede!" Nymani joined his superior.  Jellico arose swiftly and Dane read on the captain's face the seriousness of this. The off-worlder turned to his own men with a sharp order. "On your feet! We may have to move on the double. Up-mountain?" he demanded of the Chief Ranger.  The other was still listening, not only with his ears but with the whole of his tense body. Three of the deer-like creatures they had hunted for food broke out of the green wall, fled past the men as if the latter was invisible. And behind them, the hunted now and not the hunter, came a lion, its strikingly marked black-and-white hide dramatic in the light of the morning. It showed fangs in a snarl and then was gone in one huge bound. More deer things, scurrying of other small creatures, moving too fast for clear identification, and behind them the fury of destruction which marked the headlong advance of Khatka's largest mammals slamming through the jungle.  They had started up-slope when Nymani cried out. A white bulk, hard to distinguish in that light against the gray of the earth, headed after them. Dane had a fleeting glimpse of curled tusks, of an open mouth, raw-red and wide enough to engulf his whole head, of shaggy legs driving at an unbelievable pace. Asaki snapped a beam from the needler. The white monster roared and came on. They dived for the scant cover offered as the graz bull died, not two yards away from the Chief Ranger, its heavy body skidding along the earth with the force of its speed as it went down.  "That did it!" Jellico sighted coolly with his blaster as a second bull, fighting mad, tore from the jungle and pounded at them. Behind it a third tusked head thrust out of the brush, large eyes searched for an enemy. Dane studied the dead bull, but the animal did not come to life this time. These were not hallucinations. And the malignancy of the rock apes, the cunning of the native Khatkan lion, were pallid things compared to a graz herd on the rampage.  The second bull yelped with an almost canine complaint as Jellico's blaster caught it head-on. Blinded, the beast blundered ahead, climbing the mountain side. The third met a ray from Nymani's needler. But the Chief Ranger leaped from behind his sheltering rock to the one where the captain had taken refuge and pulled him into the open.  "They must not corner us here!"  Jellico agreed to that. "Come on!" he barked to Tau and Dane.  They fled along a rough way, trying to gain altitude, but finding a rising cliff wall which could not be easily climbed. Two more graz went down, one badly wounded, one safely dead. Behind them more white heads came from the brush. What original cause had started the stampede the fugitives could not guess, but now the fear and anger of the animals were centering upon them.  And, in spite of their efforts, the party was being herded into a pocket between the jungle below, where the main body of graz crashed along, and a steep wall. Given time to find the necessary finger and toe holds, a man might climb that wall, but they could not attempt it now. The portion of ledge on which they ran, stopped to fire, and then ran on again, angled to the southeast. And so they came to its end quickly, a drop ending in a plain of yellow-gray mud studded with clumps of bleached vegetation which led, like steppingstones, toward a tangle of matted, sickly looking plants and reeds.  "All right," Tau faced around, "what do we do now? Space lift? And using what for wings or jets?"  As if the graz could sense that they now had their victims safely cornered, what must have been a goodly segment of the herd hooked their way from the jungle and started up. Puffing, digging in those sturdy legs which had to take the massive weight of their barrel-shaped bodies, they made their way determinedly up-grade. One might almost believe that they had intelligently planned this end for their drive.  "We go down!" Asaki yelled, and used his needler on the leader of that climbing platoon.  "The brush islands," Nymani amended. "I show you!" He thrust his needler at Jellico and was over the edge of the ledge, hanging by his hands and swinging his weight back and forth like a pendulum. At the up-swing of his body to the right, he let go and plunged out, landing half across one of the reed islets. The Khatkan clawed his way to his knees, gained his feet, and leaped for the next bit of solid ground.  "You, Thorson!" Jellico jerked his head at Dane and the younger spaceman holstered his fire ray, slipped gingerly over the drop and prepared to repeat Nymani's feat as best he could.  He was not quite as successful with his sidewise swing, landing with only his forearms across the islet, the rest of his body being swiftly embedded in what was ooze covered only with a thin crust of dried matter. The stench of the stuff was sickening, but the fear of being entrapped in it gave him the necessary impetus to push forward, though what was meant to be a swift half-dive was more of a worm's progress. He grabbed frantically at brittle stems, at coarse grass which cut like knives at his hands. But some of the material held and he lay face down on a lump which did not give under his weight.  There was no time to linger; he had to get to the next patch, to free this dubious landing place for the men embattled on the rise above. Stumbling up, Dane judged the distance with a space-trained eye and jumped to a knob Nymani had already quitted. The Khatkan was more than halfway along toward that promise of solid ground which the tangled mass of leprous vegetation led to, zigzagging expertly from islet to islet.  There was a crash and a roar behind. Dane balanced on the third of the minute islands to look back. He saw the lash of blaster fire on the top of the cliff, Tau on his knees on the first of their chain of steppingstones, and a graz sprawled head and forequarters in the sucking muck where it had dived past the two defenders above. Needler and blaster fired together again, and then Jellico swung over the cliff rim. Tau waved vigorously and Dane took off for the next islet, just making it by lucky chance.  The rest of the journey he took in a rush, trying not to think of anything but the necessity of landing on some spot of firm ground. His last leap of all was too short, so that he went knee deep in a particularly evil-smelling pool where yellow scum spattered his breeches and he experienced the insidious pull of the bottomless stuff. A stout branch whipped across his shoulder and he caught it. With Nymani's wiry strength on the other end, Dane worked free and sat, white-faced and shivering, on a mat of brush, while the Khatkan hunter turned his attention to the safety of Tau, the next arrival.  More fortunate, or more skillful than Dane, the medic made the hop from the last tuft without mishap. But he was blowing heavily as he collapsed beside the other spaceman. Together they watched the progress of their captain.  Safe on the second tussock from the shore, Jellico halted, edged carefully around and used the needler Nymani had left with him. A shaggy head tossed and the bull fronting Asaki on the cliff went down. The Chief Ranger dodged quickly to the right and a second beast rushed out and over, to join its mired comrade in the swamp below. As Jellico shot again, the Khatkan slung his needler and went over to gain the first islet.  One more graz was wounded but luckily it hunched about, turning its formidable tusks on those that followed, thus keeping the path clear for its enemies. Jellico was making the journey, sure-footedly, with the Chief Ranger only one hillock behind. Tau sighed.  "Someday maybe this will be just another tall tale and we'll all be thought liars when we spout it," he observed. "That is if we survive to tell it. So now which way do we go? If I had my choice it would be up!"  When Dane pulled himself to his feet and surveyed their small refuge, he was ready to agree to that. For the space, packed with dead and dying vegetable matter until one sank calf deep, was a triangle with a narrow point running east into the swamp.  "They don't give up easily, do they?" Jellico looked back to the shore and the cliff. Though the wounded graz bull still held the heights against its fellows, there were others breaking from the jungle on the lower level, wandering back and forth to paw the earth, rip up soil with their tusks, and otherwise threaten anyone who would try to return to the strip they patrolled.  "They will not," Asaki answered bleakly. "Arouse a graz and it will trail you for days; kill any of the herd and you have little hope of escaping them on foot."  It would seem now that the swamp was a deterrent to pursuit. The two beasts that had fallen in the mire moaned in a pitiful rising note. They had ceased to struggle and several of their kind clustered on the shore near them, calling entreatingly. Asaki took careful aim with the needler and put one animal after another out of its misery. But the flash of those shots angered those on shore to a higher pitch of rage.  "No going back," he said. "At least not for several days."  Tau slapped a black, four-winged insect which had settled on his arm, its jaws wide open for a sampling bite. "We can't very well perch here until they forget all about us," he pointed out. "Not without water we can trust, and with the local wild life ready to test us for tasty eating."  Nymani had prowled along the swampward point of their island, and now he made his report.  "There is more high land to the east. Perhaps it will give us a bridge across."  At that moment Dane doubted his ability to make any more leaps from island to island. And it would seem Tau shared his discouragement.  "I don't suppose you could discourage our friends on shore there with a few more shots?"  Asaki shook his head. "We do not have clips enough to settle a whole herd. These might retreat from sight but they would be waiting for us in the bush, and that would mean certain death. We shall have to take the swamp road."  If Dane had considered their earlier march misery, this was sheer torture. Since footing was never secure, falls were frequent, and within a quarter-hour they were all plastered with evil-smelling slime and mud which hardened to rock consistency when exposed to the air. Painful as this was, it did protect a portion of their bodies from the insects with which the swamp was well stocked.  And, in spite of their efforts to find a way out, the only possible paths led them deeper into the center of the unexplored morass. At last Asaki called a halt and a council to consider retreat. To locate an island from which they could at least watch the shore appealed very strongly indeed.  "We have to have water." Tau's voice was a harsh croak, issuing out of a mask of green mud festooned with trailing weeds.  "This ground is rising." Asaki smacked the stock of his needler against the surface on which he crouched. "I think perhaps there may be clean land soon to come."  Jellico hitched his way up a sapling, now bending under his weight. Through the vision lenses he studied the route ahead.  "You're right about that," he called to the Chief Ranger. "There's a showing of the right sort of green to the left, about half a mile on. And," he glanced about at the westering sun, "we have about an hour yet of good light in which to make it. I wouldn't try such a run after dark."  That promise of green bolstered their weary spirits for a last exhausting effort. Once again they were faced with a series of islet leaps, and now they carried with them brush culled from the bigger tussocks to aid in times of need.  When Dane scrambled up the last pull, staggered, and went down to his knees again, he knew he was done. He did not even move at an excited cry from Nymani, echoed a moment later by Asaki. It was not until the latter leaned over him, a canteen open in his hand, that Dane aroused a little.  "Drink!" the Khatkan urged. "We have found a water tree. This is fresh."  The liquid might have been fresh, but it also had a peculiar taste, which Dane did not note until he had gulped down a generous swallow. At that moment he was past caring about anything but the fact that he did have a portion of drinkable stuff in hand.  Here the stunted, unnatural growth of the swamplands had given away to the more normal vegetation of the jungle-clad lowlands. Had they come clear across the swamp, Dane wondered dully, or was this only a large island in the midst of the stinking boglands?  He drank again and regained strength enough to crawl to where his shipmates lay. It was some time before he was interested in much besides the fact that he could drink when he wished. Then he watched Jellico waver to his feet, his head turned eastward. Tau, too, sat up as if alerted by the _Queen's_ alarm buzzer.  The Khatkans were gone, perhaps back to the water tree. But all three of the spacemen heard that sound, a far off throbbing rhythm which was a vibration as well. Jellico looked to Tau.  "Drums?"  "Could be." The medic screwed the cap back on his canteen. "I'd say we have company--only I'd like to know what kind!"  They might have been mistaken about the drums, but none of them could have been mistaken about the bolt which came out of nowhere to slice through a tree trunk as a knife might slash wet clay. Blaster--and a particular type of blaster!  "Patrol issue!" Tau lay flat, squeezing himself against the earth as if he wished he could ooze into it.  Jellico wriggled toward the bush in answer to a low call from Asaki, and the others made a worm's progress in his wake. Under cover they found the Chief Ranger readying his needler.  "Poacher camp here," he explained bleakly. "And they know about us."  "A perfect end to a stinking day," remarked Tau dispassionately. "We might have guessed something of this sort was waiting." He tried to rub away some of the dried clay coating his chin. "But do poachers use drums?"  The Chief Ranger scowled. "That is what Nymani has gone to find out."     VII   Darkness closed in while they waited for Nymani's return. There had been no further attack from the blaster wielder; perhaps he was only trying to pin them down where they were. Out over the swamp, weird patches of phosphorescence moved in small ghostly clouds, and bright dots of insects with their own built-in lighting systems flashed spark-fashion or sailed serenely on regular flight plans. At night the wonder of the place was far removed from the squalid reality of the day. They chewed on their rations, drank sparingly of the water, and tried to keep alert to any sight or sound.  That monotonous undertone, which might or might not be drums, continued as a basic hum to the noises of the night, drowned out at intervals by a splash, a mutter or cry from some swamp creature. Beside Dane, Jellico stiffened, moved his blaster, as someone wriggled through the brush, trilling softly.  "Off-worlders," Nymani reported in gasps to Asaki, "and outlaws, too. They make a hunting sing--tomorrow they march for a killing."  Asaki rested his chin on his broad forearm. "Outlaws?"  "They show no lord's badge. But each I saw wears a bracelet of three, five, or ten tails. They are Trackers indeed, and Hunters of the best!"  "They have huts?"  "Not so. There are no dwellers in the inners courts here." Out of habit Nymani used the polite term for the women of his race. "I would say they tarry only for the space of a hunt. And on the boots of one I saw salt crust."  "Salt crust!" Asaki snapped and half arose. "So that is the type of lure they use. There must be a saline mire near here to pull game--"  "How many off-worlders?" Jellico broke in.  "Three who are Hunters, one who is different."  "How different?" questioned Asaki.  "He wears upon his body garments which are strange; on his head a round covering such as we see upon the off-worlders of the ships--"  "A spaceman!"  Asaki laughed harshly. "Why not? They must have some method of transporting their hides."  "You can't tell me," Jellico returned, "that anyone is able to set a ship down in this muck. It would simply be buried for all time."  "But, Captain, what type of a spaceport does a Free Trader need? Do you not planet your own ship on worlds where there are no waiting cradles, no fitter shops, none of the conveniences such as mark the field Combine maintains on Xecho?"  "Of course I do. But one does need a reasonably smooth stretch of territory, open enough so the tail flames won't start a forest fire. You don't ever ride a tail push down in a swamp!"  "Which testifies to a trail out of here, fairly well-traveled, and some kind of a usable landing space not too far away," Asaki replied. "And that could very well serve us."  "But they know we are here," Tau pointed out.  It was Nymani's turn to laugh. "Man from the stars, there is no trail so well-hidden that a Ranger of the preserves cannot nose it out, nor any Hunter--be he a two or five bracelet veteran--who can keep pinned down a determined man of the forest service!"  Dane lost interest in the argument at that moment. He was at the edge of their line, the nearest to the swamp, and he had been watching patches of ghostly light flitting above the rank water-weeds. For the past few moments those wisps of faded radiance had been gathering into a growing anthropomorphic blot hanging over the morass several yards away. And the misty outlines were now assuming more concrete shape. He watched, unable to believe in what he was seeing. At first the general outline, non-defined as it was, made him think of a rock ape. But there were no pointed ears above the round skull, no snout on the visage turned in profile toward him.  More and more patches of swamp luminescence were drawn to that glowing figure. What balanced there now, as if walking the treacherous surface of the swampland, was no animal. It was a man, or the semblance of one, a small, thin man--a man he had seen once before, on the terrace of Asaki's mountain fortress.  The thing stood almost complete, its head cocked in what was an attitude of listening.  "Lumbrilo!" Dane identified it, still knowing that the witch doctor could not be standing there listening for them. But, to shake him still farther, the head turned at his cry. Only there were no eyes, no features on the white expanse which should have been a face. And somehow that made the monster more menacing, convincing Dane against sane logic that the thing _was_ spying on them.  "Demon!" That was Nymani; and over his sudden quaver, robbed of all the confidence which had been there only moments earlier, came Asaki's demand:  "What stands there, Medic? Tell us that!"  "A whip to drive us out of hiding, sir. As you know as well as I. If Nymani spied upon them, then they have spied upon us in turn. And this, I think, also answers another question. If there is a canker of trouble on Khatka, then Lumbrilo is close to its root."  "Nymani!" The Chief Ranger's voice was the crack of a lash. "Will you forget again that you are a man, and run crying for shelter against a shaft of light? As this off-world Medic says, Lumbrilo fashions such as that to drive us into our enemies' hands!"  The shadow thing in the swamp moved, putting its foot forward on surface which would not bear the weight of a human body, taking a deliberate step and then another, heading for the concealing brush where the fugitives lay.  "Can you get rid of it, Tau?" Jellico asked in his usual crisp voice. He might have been inquiring about some problem aboard the _Queen_.  "I'd rather get at the source." There was a grim note in the Medic's reply. "And to do that I want to look at their camp."  "Well enough!" Asaki crept back in the brush.  The ghost of that which was not a man had reached the shore of the island, stood there, its blank head turned toward them. Weird as it was, now that the first shock of sighting it was over, the spacemen could accept and dismiss it as they had not been so able to dismiss the phantom rock ape.  "If that thing was sent to drive us," Dane ventured, "wouldn't we be playing their game by going inland now?"  The Chief Ranger did not pause in his crawl to the left. "I think not. They do not expect us to arrive with our wits about us. Panic-stricken men are easy to pull down. This time Lumbrilo has overreached himself. Had he not played that game with the rock ape, he might have been able to stampede us now."  Though the white thing continued to move inland, it did not change course to fall in behind them on the new route. Whatever it was, it did not possess a mind.  There was a rustling, faint but distinguishable. Then Dane caught Nymani's whisper.  "The one left to watch the inland trail does so no longer. We need not fear an alarm from _him_. Also, here is another blaster for our use."  Away from the open by the swamp, the gloom was deeper. Dane was guided only by the noises of the less-experienced Jellico and Tau made in their progress.  They edged down into a small cut, floored with reeds and mud, where some of the moisture from the soggy land about them gathered into a half pool. Straight through this swale the Khatkans set course.  The drum beat grew louder. Now there was a glow against the dark--fire ahead? Dane squirmed forward and at last gained a vantage point from which to survey the poachers' camp.  There were shelters erected there, three of them, but they were mainly roofs of leaves and branches. In two of them were stored bales of hides sewn into plastic cloth, ready to ship. Before the third hut lounged four off-worlders. And Nymani was very right; one of them wore ship's uniform.  To the right of the fire was a ring of natives and another man, slightly apart, who beat the drum. But of the witch doctor there was no sign. And Dane, thinking of that mist-born thing at the swamp's edge, shivered. He could believe Tau's explanation of the drug which produced hallucinations back on the mountain side. But how that likeness fashioned of phosphorescence had been sent by an absent man to hunt his enemies was a eerie puzzle.  "Lumbrilo is not here." Nymani's thoughts must have been moving along the same path.  Dane could hear movements in the dark beside him.  "There's a long-distance com unit in that third hut," Tau observed.  "So I see," Jellico snapped. "Could you reach your men over the mountain with that, sir?"  "I do not know. But if Lumbrilo is not here, how can he make his image walk the night?" the Chief Ranger demanded impatiently.  "We shall see. If Lumbrilo is not here--he shall come." And the promise in Tau's tone was sure. "Those off-worlders will have to be out of action first. And with that walking thing sent to drive us in, they must be waiting for us."  "If they have sentries out, I will silence them!" promised Nymani.  "You have a plan?" Asaki's wide shoulders and upheld head showed for an instant against the light from the camp.  "You want Lumbrilo," Tau replied. "Very well, sir, I believe I can give him to you, and in the doing discredit him with your Khatkans. But not with the off-worlders free to move."  The program was not going to be easy, Dane decided. Every one of the poachers was armed with a Patrol blaster of the latest type, and a small part of his mind speculated as to what would be the result of that information conveyed to official quarters. Free Traders and Patrolmen did not always see eye-to-eye over the proper action to be taken on the galactic frontier. The _Queen's_ crew had had one such brush with authority in the immediate past. But each realized that the other had an important role in the general scheme of things, and if it came to a clash between the law and outlaws, Free Traders fought beside the Patrol.  "Why not give them what they expect--with reservations?" inquired Jellico. "They've set us up to be stampeded into camp, flying ahead of that tame ghost of theirs. Suppose we do stampede--after Nymani has removed any sentries--stampede so well we sweep right over them? I want to get at that com unit."  "You don't think they'll just mow us down as we come in?"  "You delivered a blow to Lumbrilo's pride; he won't be satisfied with just your burning," the captain answered Tau, "not if I'm any judge of character. And we'd furnish hostages of a sort--especially the Chief Ranger. No, if they had wanted to kill us they would have shot us off those islands when we came here. There would have been no playing around with ghosts and goblins."  "There is reason in your words. And it is true they would like to have me, those outlaws down there," Asaki commented. "I am of the Magawaya and we have pressed always for stronger security methods to be used against such as they. But I do not see how we can take the camp."  "We won't go in from the front--as they expect us to do. But a try from the north, getting at the off-worlders first.... Three men causing enough disturbance to cover operations of the other two...."  "So?" There was a moment of silence as the Chief Ranger evaluated that. Then he added a few comments of his own.  "That off-worlder who wears spaceman's clothing, his weapon is not drawn, though the others are ready. But I believe that you are right in thinking they expect to be warned by sentries. Those we can see to. Suppose then, Captain, you and I play the fear-crazed men running from demons. Nymani will cover us from the dark and your two men--"  Tau spoke up, "Give me leave to flush out our other quarry, sir. I believe I can keep him occupied. Dane, you'll take the drum."  "Drum?" With his mind on blasters, it was startling to be offered a noise-maker.  "It's your business to get that drum. And when you get it I want you to beat out 'Terra Bound.' You certainly can play that, can't you?"  "I don't understand," Dane began and then swallowed the rest of his protest, knowing that Tau was not going to explain why he needed to have the hackneyed popular song of the spaceways played in a Khatkan swamp. As a Free Trader he had had quite a few odd jobs handed him during the past couple of years, but this was the first time he had been ordered to serve as a musician.  They waited for Nymani through dragging minutes. Surely those in the camp would expect their arrival soon now? Dane's fire ray was in his hand as he measured the distance to the drummer's stand.  "It is done," Nymani whispered from the darkness behind them. Jellico and the Chief Ranger moved to the left; Tau crept to the right and Dane pushed level with the medic.  "When they move," Tau's lips were beside his ear, "jump for that drum. I don't care how you get it, but get it and keep it!"  "Yes, sir!"  There was a wailing cry from the north, a howl of witless fear. The singers stopped in mid-note, the drummer paused, his hand uplifted. Dane darted forward in a plunge which carried him to that man. The Khatkan did not have time to rise from his knees as the barrel of the fire rod struck his head, sending him spinning. Then the drum was cradled in the spaceman's arm, close to his chest, his weapon aimed across it at the startled natives.  The crackle of blaster fire, the shrill whine of needlers in action, raised a bedlam from the other end of the camp. Backing up a little, Dane went down on one knee, his weapon ready to sweep over the bewildered natives, the drum resting on the earth against his body. Keeping the fire rod steady, his left hand went to work, not in the muted cadence the Khatkan drummer had chosen, but in hard and vigorous thumps which rolled across the clamor of the fight. There was no forgetting the beat of "Terra Bound" and he delivered it with force, so that the familiar da-dah-da-da droned loud enough to awaken the whole camp.  Dane's move appeared to completely baffle the Khatkan outlaws. They stared at him, the whites of their eyes doubly noticeable in their dark faces, their mouths a little agape. As usual the unexpected had driven them off guard. He dared not look away from that gathering to see how the fight at the other end of the camp was progressing. But he did see Tau's advance.  The medic came into the light of the fire, not with his ordinary loose-limbed spaceman's stride, but mincingly, with a dancing step, and he was singing to the drum beat of "Terra Bound." Dane could not understand the words, but he knew that they patterned in and out of the drum beats, weaving a net between singer and listeners as Lumbrilo had woven his net on the mountain terrace.  Tau had them! Had every one of the native outlaws ensnared, so that Dane rested his weapon across his knee and took up the lower beat with the fingers of his right hand as well.  _Da-dah-da-da_.... The innocuous repetitive refrain of the original song which had been repeating itself in his mind faded, and somehow he caught the menace in the new words Tau was mouthing.  Twice the medic shuffled about a circle of his own making. Then he stooped, took a hunting knife from the belt of the nearest Khatkan and held it point out toward the dark east. Dane would not have believed the medic knew the drill he now displayed, for with no opponent save the dancing firelight he fought a knife duel, feinting, striking, twisting, retreating, attacking, all in time to the beat of the drum Dane was no longer conscious of playing. And as he strove it was very easy to picture another fighting against him. So that when the knife came up in a vicious thrust which was the finish of his last attack, Dane stared stupidly at the ground, half expecting to see a body lying there.  Once more Tau ceremoniously saluted with his blade to the east. Then he laid it on the ground and stood astride its gleaming length.  "Lumbrilo!" His confident voice arose above the call of the drum. "Lumbrilo--I am waiting."     VIII   Vaguely aware that the clamor at the other end of the camp had died away, Dane muted the sound of his drum. Over its round top he could watch the Khatkan outlaws; their heads bobbed and swayed in time to the beat of his fingers. He, too, could feel the pull of Tau's voice. But what would come in answer? That shadowy thing which had been loosed to drive them here? Or the man himself?  To Dane, the ruddy light of the fire dimmed, yet there was no actual dying of those flames which coiled and thrust around the wood. And the acrid scent of burning was thick. How much of what followed was real, how much the product of his tense nerves, Dane was never afterwards able to tell. In fact, whether all the witnesses there saw the same sights could be questioned. Did each man, Khatkan and off-worlder, see only what his particular set of emotions and memories dictated?  Something swept in from the east, something which was not as tangible as the creature born of swamp mist. Rather it came as an unseen menace to the fire, and all that fire signifies to human kind--security, comradeship, a weapon against the age-old forces of the dangerous night. Was that threat, too, only in their minds? Or had Lumbrilo some power to so shape his hatred?  The unseen was cold; it sapped a man's strength, bit at his brain, weighted his hands and feet, weakened him. It strove to soften him into clay another could remold. Nothingness, darkness, all that was opposed to life and warmth and reality, arose in the night, gathered together against them.  Yet still Tau fronted that invisible wave, his head high. And between his sturdily planted feet the knife gleamed bright with a radiance of its own.  "Ahhh--" Tau's voice curled out, to pierce that creeping menace. Then he was singing again, the cadence of his unknown words rising a little above the pattern wrought by the drum.  Dane forced his heavy hands to continue the beat, his wrists to rise and fall in defiance of that which crept to eat their strength and make them less then men.  "Lumbrilo! I, Tau, of another star, another sky, another world, bid you come forth and range your power against mine!" Now there was a sharper note in that demand, the snap of an order.  He was answered by another wave of the black negation--stronger, rolling up to smash them down, as a wave in the heavy surf of a wild ocean pounds its force against the beach. This time Dane thought he could see that dark mass. He tore his eyes away before it took on substance, concentrating on the movements of his hands against the drum head, refusing to believe that hammer of power was rising to flatten them all. He had heard Tau describe such things in the past. But told in familiar quarters on board the _Queen_, such experiences were only stories. Here was danger unleashed. Yet the medic stood unbowed as the wave broke upon him in full.  And, advancing under the crest of that lick of destruction, came its controller. This was no ghost drawn from the materials of the swamp; this was a man, walking quietly, his hands as empty as Tau's, yet grasping weapons none of them could see.  In the firelight, as the wave receded sullenly, men moaned, lay face down upon the ground, beat their hands feebly against the earth. But, as Lumbrilo came on from the shadows, one of them got to his hands and knees, moving with small tortured jerks. He crawled toward Tau, his head lolling on his shoulders as the head of the dead rock ape had done. Dane patted the drum with one hand while, with the other, he groped for his fire ray. He tried to shout in warning and found that he could not utter a sound.  Tau's arm moved, raised from his side, made a circling motion.  The creeping man, his eyes rolled up in his head until only the whites gleamed blindly in the limited light, followed that gesture. He drew level with the medic, passed beyond toward Lumbrilo, whining as a hound prevented from obeying his master might lament.  "So be it, Lumbrilo," Tau said. "This is between you and me. Or do you not dare to risk your power against mine? Is Lumbrilo so weak a one that he must send another to do his will?"  Raising both hands again the medic brought them down, curling inward, until he stooped and touched them to the ground. When he straightened once again the knife was in his grasp and he tossed it behind him.  The smoke from the fire swirled out in a long tongue, coiled about Lumbrilo and was gone. A black and white beast stood where the man had been, its tufted tail lashing, its muzzle a mask of snarling hate and blood lust.  But Tau met that transformation with laughter which was like the lash of a whip.  "We both be men, you and I, Lumbrilo. Meet me as a man and keep those trickeries for those who have not the clear sight. A child plays as a child, so--" Tau's voice came in a rumble, but Tau was gone. The huge, hairy thing which swayed in his place turned a gorilla's beast visage to his enemy. For a breathless moment Terran ape confronted Khatkan lion. Then the spaceman was himself again. "The time for games is over, man of Khatka. You have tried to hunt us to our deaths, have you not? Therefore death shall be the portion of the loser now."  Lion vanished, man stood watching, alertly, as swordsman might face swordsman with a blood feud lying on their blades. To Dane's eyes the Khatkan made no move. Yet the fire leaped high, as if freshly fed, and flames burst from the wood, flew into the air, red and perilous birds, darting at Tau until they outlined him from the ground under his boots to an arch over his head. They united and spun faster until Dane, watching with dazzled eyes, saw the wheel become a blur of light, hiding Tau within its fiery core. His own wrists ached with the strain of his drumming as he lifted one hand and tried to shield his sight from the glare of that pillar of fire.  Lumbrilo was chanting--a heavy blast of words. Dane stiffened; his traitorous hands were falling into the rhythm of that other song! Straightaway he raised both from the drum head, brought them down in a discordinate series of thumps which bore no relation to either the song Tau wanted or that which Lumbrilo was now crooning. _Thump--thump--thump_--Dane beat it out frantically, belaboring the drum head as he wanted to sink his fists home on the body of the Khatkan witch doctor.  The pillar of fire swayed, fluttered as if a wind drove it--and was gone. Tau, unmarked, smiled.  "Fire!" He pointed his fingers at Lumbrilo. "Would you try earth, and water, and air also, wizard? Call hither your whirlwind, up your flood, summon the land to quake. None of those shall bring me down!"  Shapes came flooding out of the night, some monstrous, some human, streaming past Lumbrilo to crowd into the circle of firelight. Some Dane thought he knew, some were strangers. Men wearing space uniforms, or the dress of other worlds, women--they strode, wept, mingled with the monsters to laugh, curse, threaten.  Dane guessed that Lumbrilo sent now against the Terran the harvest of the medic's own memories. He shut his eyes against this enforced intrusion upon another's past, but not before he saw Tau's face, strained, fined to the well-shaped bones beneath the thin flesh, holding still a twisted smile as he met each memory, accepted the pain it held for him, and set it aside unshaken.  "This, too, has no power any longer, man who walks in the dark."  Dane opened his eyes. Those crowding wraiths were fading, losing substance. Lumbrilo crouched, his lips drawn back from his teeth, his hatred plain to read.  "I am not clay to be molded by your hands, Lumbrilo. And now I say that the time has come to call an end--"  Tau raised his hands slowly once again, holding them away from his body, palms pointing earthward. And beneath them, on either side of the spaceman, two black shadows gathered on the surface of the ground.  "You have fettered yourself with your own bounds. As you have been the hunter, so shall you now be the hunted."  Those shadows were growing as plants might issue from the packed soil of the camping ground. When his hands were shoulder high, Tau held them steady. Now on either side of his tautly held body crouched one of the black-and-white lions with which Lumbrilo had identified his own brand of magic throughout the year.  Lumbrilo's "lion" had been larger than life, more intelligent, more dangerous, subtly different from the normal animal it counterfeited. So now were these. And both of them raised their heads to gaze intently into the medic's face.  "Hunt well, brothers in fur," he said slowly, almost caressingly. "Him whom you hunt shall grant you sport in the going."  "Stop it!" A man leaped from the shadows behind the witch doctor. Firelight made plain his off-world dress, and he swung up a blaster, aiming at the nearest of the waiting beasts. That flash struck true, but it neither killed nor even singed the fine fur of the animal's pelt.  As the blaster's aim was swung from beast to man, Dane fired first. His ray brought a scream from the other, who dropped his weapon from a badly seared hand to reel back, cursing.  Tau waved his hands gently. The great animal heads turned obediently, until the red eyes were set on Lumbrilo. Facing them, the witch doctor straightened, spat out his hate at the medic:  "I do not run to be hunted, devil man!"  "I think you do, Lumbrilo. For you must taste fear now as you have made other men drink of it, so that it fills your blood and races through your body, clouds your mind to make of you less than a man. You have hunted out those who doubted your power, who stood in your chosen path, whom you wanted removed from the earth of Khatka. Do you doubt that they wait in the last dark for you now, ready to greet you, witch doctor? What they have known, you shall also know. This night you have shown me all that lies in my past that is weak, that was evil, that I may regret or find sorrow for. So shall you also remember through the few hours left you. Aye, you _shall_ run, Lumbrilo!"  As he spoke, Tau approached the other, the two black-and-white hunters pacing beside him. Now he stooped and caught up a pinch of soil and spat upon it three times. Then he threw the tiny clod of earth at the witch doctor. It struck Lumbrilo just above the heart and the man reeled under what might have been a murderous blow.  The Khatkan broke then, completely. With a wailing cry he whirled and ran, crashing into the brush as one who runs blindly and without hope. Behind him the two beasts leaped noiselessly together and all three were gone.  Tau swayed, put his hand to his head. Dane kicked away the drum, arose from his cramped position stiffly to go to him. But the medic was not yet done. He returned to stand over the prostrate native hunters and he clapped his hands sharply.  "You are men, and you shall act as men henceforth. That which was, is no longer. Stand free, for the dark power follows him who misused it, and fear no longer eats from your basins, drinks from your cups, or lies beside you on the sleep mats."  "Tau!" Jellico's shout reached them over the cries of the rousing Khatkans. But Dane was there first, catching the medic before he slumped to the ground; but he was dragged with that dead weight until he sat with the medic's head on his shoulder, the other's body resting heavily against him. For one horror-filled moment Dane feared that he did indeed hold a dead man, that one of the outlaw Hunters must have struck a last blow for his discredited leader. Then Tau sighed and began to breathe deeply. Dane glanced up, amazed, at the captain.  "He's asleep!"  Jellico knelt and his hand went to test heart beat, then to touch the medic's worn and dirty face. "Best thing for him," he said briskly. "He's had it."  It took some time to get the facts of their triumph sorted out. Two of the off-worlder poachers were dead. The other and the spaceman were prisoners, while Nymani rounded up in addition the man Dane had burned to save Tau. When the younger spaceman returned from making the medic comfortable in the shelter, he found Asaki and Jellico holding an impromptu court of inquiry.  The dazed native Hunters had been expertly looped together by Nymani and, a little apart from them, the off-worlders were under examination.  "An I-C man, eh?" Jellico, smoothing a mud-spattered chin with a grimed hand, regarded the latest arrival measuringly. "Trying to run in and break a Combine charter, were you? You'd better spill the facts; your own head office will disown you, you ought to know that. They never back any failures in these undercover deals."  "I want medical attention," snapped the other, cradling his seared hand to his chest. "Or do you plan to turn me over to these savages?"  "Seeing as how you tried to blast our medic," replied the captain with a grin which was close to shark-like, "he may not feel much like patching up those fingers of yours. Stick 'em in where they have no business, and they're apt to get burned. At any rate he's not going to look at 'em until he's had a chance to rest. I'll give you first aid. And while I'm working we'll talk. I-C going into the poaching trade now? That news is going to please Combine; they have no use for you boys anyway."  His answer was lurid and uninformative. But the uniform tunic the other wore could not be so easily explained away. Dane, worn out, stretched his aching length on a pile of mats and lost all interest in the argument.         *       *       *       *       *  Two days later they stood once more on the same terrace where Lumbrilo had wrought his magic and met his first defeat. This time no lightning played along the mountain ridges and the blaze of the sun was so bright and clear that one could hardly believe in the fantastic happenings of that swamp clearing where men had fought with weapons not made by hands. The three from the _Queen_ moved away from the parapet to meet the Chief Ranger as he came down the stairs.  "A messenger has just arrived. The hunter was hunted indeed, and his going was witnessed by many--though they did not see those which hunted him. Lumbrilo is dead; he came to his end by the Great River."  Jellico started. "But that is almost fifty miles from the swamp, on this side of the mountain!"  "He was hunted and he fled--as you promised," Asaki said to Tau. "You made strong magic, off-world man."  The medic shook his head slowly. "I but turned his own methods against him. Because he believed in his power, that same power, reflected back, broke him. Had I been facing one who did not believe...." He shrugged. "Our first meeting set the pattern. From that moment he feared a little that I could match him, and his uncertainty pierced a hole in his armor."  "Why on earth did you want 'Terra Bound?'" burst out Dane, still seeking an explanation for that one small mystery among the others.  Tau chuckled. "In the first place, that blasted tune has haunted us all for so long that I knew its rhythm was probably the one you could keep to without hardly knowing that you were beating it out. And, in the second place, its alien pattern was a part of our particular background, to counteract Lumbrilo's native Khatkan music, which was certainly a big factor in _his_ stage setting. He must have believed that we would not find out about the drugged water and so would be prepared for any fantasy he cared to produce. When they saw us coming out over the swamp they counted us easy takings. His practice had always been with Khatkans, and he judged us by their reactions to stimuli he knew well how to use. So he failed...."  Asaki smiled. "Which was good for Khatka but ill for Lumbrilo and those using him to make mischief here. The poacher and the outlaw Hunters will meet with our justice, which I do not believe they will relish. But the other two, the spaceman and the company agent, are to be sent to Xecho to face Combine authorities. It is my thought that those will not accept kindly the meddling of another company in their territory."  Jellico grunted. "Kindness and Combine are widely separated in such matters. But we can now take passage on the same ship as your prisoners--"  "But, my friend, you have not yet seen the preserve. I assure you that _this_ time there shall be no trouble. We have several days yet before you must return to your ship--"  The captain of the _Queen_ held up his hand. "Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to inspect the Zoboru preserve, sir--next year. As it is, my holiday is over and the _Queen_ is waiting for us on Xecho. Also, permit me to send you some tapes dealing with the newest types of flitters--guaranteed against flight failures."  "Yes, guaranteed," Tau added guilelessly, "not to break down, lose course, or otherwise disrupt a pleasant excursion."  The Chief Ranger threw back his head and his deep-chested laughter was echoed from the heights above them. "Very well, Captain. Your mail run will bring you back to Xecho at intervals. Meanwhile I shall study your sales tapes concerning the non-expendable flitters. But you _shall_ visit Zoboru--and pleasantly, very pleasantly, I assure you, Medic Tau!"  "I wonder," Tau muttered and Dane heard. "Just now the quiet of deep space is a far, far more entrancing proposition!"The sun warmed Mark Howell's back pleasantly. Underfoot, the mosslike stuff was soft and yielding, and there was a fragrance in the air unlike anything he had ever smelled. He was going to like this planet; he knew it. The question was, how would it, and its people, like him? He watched the little figures advancing across the fields from the mound, with the village out of sight on the other end of it and the combat-car circling lazily on contragravity above.  Major Luis Gofredo, the Marine officer, spoke without lowering his binoculars:  "They have a tubular thing about twelve feet long; six of them are carrying it on poles, three to a side, and a couple more are walking behind it. Mark, do you think it could be a cannon?"  So far, he didn't know enough to have an opinion, and said so, adding:  "What I saw of the village in the screen from the car, it looked pretty primitive. Of course, gunpowder's one of those things a primitive people could discover by accident, if the ingredients were available."  "We won't take any chances, then."  "You think they're hostile? I was hoping they were coming out to parley with us."  That was Paul Meillard. He had a right to be anxious; his whole future in the Colonial Office would be made or ruined by what was going to happen here.  The joint Space Navy-Colonial Office expedition was looking for new planets suitable for colonization; they had been out, now, for four years, which was close to maximum for an exploring expedition. They had entered eleven systems, and made landings on eight planets. Three had been reasonably close to Terra-type. There had been Fafnir; conditions there would correspond to Terra during the Cretaceous Period, but any Cretaceous dinosaur would have been cute and cuddly to the things on Fafnir. Then there had been Imhotep; in twenty or thirty thousand years, it would be a fine planet, but at present it was undergoing an extensive glaciation. And Irminsul, covered with forests of gigantic trees; it would have been fine except for the fauna, which was nasty, especially a race of subsapient near-humanoids who had just gotten as far as clubs and _coup-de-poing_ axes. Contact with them had entailed heavy ammunition expenditure, with two men and a woman killed and a dozen injured. He'd had a limp, himself, for a while as a result.  As for the other five, one had been an all-out hell-planet, and the rest had been the sort that get colonized by irreconcilable minority-groups who want to get away from everybody else. The Colonial Office wouldn't even consider any of them.  Then they had found this one, third of a G0-star, eighty million miles from primary, less axial inclination than Terra, which would mean a more uniform year-round temperature, and about half land surface. On the evidence of a couple of sneak landings for specimens, the biochemistry was identical with Terra's and the organic matter was edible. It was the sort of planet every explorer dreams of finding, except for one thing.  It was inhabited by a sapient humanoid race, and some of them were civilized enough to put it in Class V, and Colonial Office doctrine on Class V planets was rigid. Friendly relations with the natives had to be established, and permission to settle had to be guaranteed in a treaty of some sort with somebody more or less authorized to make one.  If Paul Meillard could accomplish that, he had it made. He would stay on with forty or fifty of the ship's company to make preparations. In a year a couple of ships would come out from Terra, with a thousand colonists, and a battalion or so of Federation troops, to protect them from the natives and vice versa. Meillard would automatically be appointed governor-general.  But if he failed, he was through. Not out--just through. When he got back to Terra, he would be promoted to some home office position at slightly higher base pay but without the three hundred per cent extraterrestrial bonus, and he would vegetate there till he retired. Every time his name came up, somebody would say, "Oh, yes; he flubbed the contact on Whatzit."  It wouldn't do the rest of them any good, either. There would always be the suspicion that they had contributed to the failure.         *       *       *       *       *  _Bwaaa-waaa-waaanh!_  The wavering sound hung for an instant in the air. A few seconds later, it was repeated, then repeated again.  "Our cannon's a horn," Gofredo said. "I can't see how they're blowing it, though."  There was a stir to right and left, among the Marines deployed in a crescent line on either side of the contact team; a metallic clatter as weapons were checked. A shadow fell in front of them as a combat-car moved into position above.  "What do you suppose it means?" Meillard wondered.  "Terrans, go home." He drew a frown from Meillard with the suggestion. "Maybe it's supposed to intimidate us."  "They're probably doing it to encourage themselves," Anna de Jong, the psychologist, said. "I'll bet they're really scared stiff."  "I see how they're blowing it," Gofredo said. "The man who's walking behind it has a hand-bellows." He raised his voice. "Fix bayonets! These people don't know anything about rifles, but they know what spears are. They have some of their own."  So they had. The six who walked in the lead were unarmed, unless the thing one of them carried was a spear. So, it seemed, were the horn-bearers. Behind them, however, in an open-order skirmish-line, came fifty-odd with weapons. Most of them had spears, the points glinting redly. Bronze, with a high copper content. A few had bows. They came slowly; details became more plainly visible.  The leader wore a long yellow robe; the thing in his hand was a bronze-headed staff. Three of his companions also wore robes; the other two were bare-legged in short tunics. The horn-bearers wore either robes or tunics; the spearmen and bowmen behind either wore tunics or were naked except for breechclouts. All wore sandals. They were red-brown in color, completely hairless; they had long necks, almost chinless lower jaws, and fleshy, beaklike noses that gave them an avian appearance which was heightened by red crests, like roosters' combs, on the tops of their heads.  "Well, aren't they something to see?" Lillian Ransby, the linguist asked.  "I wonder how we look to them," Paul Meillard said.  That was something to wonder about, too. The differences between one and another of the Terrans must puzzle them. Paul Meillard, as close to being a pure Negro as anybody in the Seventh Century of the Atomic Era was to being pure anything. Lillian Ransby, almost ash-blond. Major Gofredo, barely over the minimum Service height requirement; his name was Old Terran Spanish, but his ancestry must have been Polynesian, Amerind and Mongolian. Karl Dorver, the sociographer, six feet six, with red hair. Bennet Fayon, the biologist and physiologist, plump, pink-faced and balding. Willi Schallenmacher, with a bushy black beard....  They didn't have any ears, he noticed, and then he was taking stock of the things they wore and carried. Belts, with pouches, and knives with flat bronze blades and riveted handles. Three of the delegation had small flutes hung by cords around their necks, and a fourth had a reed Pan-pipe. No shields, and no swords; that was good. Swords and shields mean organized warfare, possibly a warrior-caste. This crowd weren't warriors. The spearmen and bowmen weren't arrayed for battle, but for a drive-hunt, with the bows behind the spears to stop anything that broke through the line.  "All right; let's go meet them." The querulous, uncertain note was gone from Meillard's voice; he knew what to do and how to do it.         *       *       *       *       *  Gofredo called to the Marines to stand fast. Then they were advancing to meet the natives, and when they were twenty feet apart, both groups halted. The horn stopped blowing. The one in the yellow robe lifted his staff and said something that sounded like, "_Tweedle-eedle-oodly-eenk_."  The horn, he saw, was made of strips of leather, wound spirally and coated with some kind of varnish. Everything these people had was carefully and finely made. An old culture, but a static one. Probably tradition-bound as all get-out.  Meillard was raising his hands; solemnly he addressed the natives:  "'Twas brillig and the slithy toves were whooping it up in the Malemute Saloon, and the kid that handled the music box did gyre and gimble in the wabe, and back of the bar in a solo game all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgabe the lady that's known as Lou."  That was supposed to show them that we, too, have a spoken language, to prove that their language and ours were mutually incomprehensible, and to demonstrate the need for devising a means of communication. At least that was what the book said. It demonstrated nothing of the sort to this crowd. It scared them. The dignitary with the staff twittered excitedly. One of his companions agreed with him at length. Another started to reach for his knife, then remembered his manners. The bellowsman pumped a few blasts on the horn.  "What do you think of the language?" he asked Lillian.  "They all sound that bad, when you first hear them. Give them a few seconds, and then we'll have Phase Two."  When the gibbering and skreeking began to fall off, she stepped forward. Lillian was, herself, a good test of how human aliens were; this gang weren't human enough to whistle at her. She touched herself on the breast. "Me," she said.  The natives seemed shocked. She repeated the gesture and the word, then turned and addressed Paul Meillard. "You."  "Me," Meillard said, pointing to himself. Then he said, "You," to Luis Gofredo. It went around the contact team; when it came to him, he returned it to point of origin.  "I don't think they get it at all," he added in a whisper.  "They ought to," Lillian said. "Every language has a word for self and a word for person-addressed."  "Well, look at them," Karl Dorver invited. "Six different opinions about what we mean, and now the band's starting an argument of their own."  "Phase Two-A," Lillian said firmly, stepping forward. She pointed to herself. "Me--Lillian Ransby. Lillian Ransby--me _name_. You--_name_?  "_Bwoooo!_" the spokesman screamed in horror, clutching his staff as though to shield it from profanation. The others howled like a hound-pack at a full moon, except one of the short-tunic boys, who was slapping himself on the head with both hands and yodeling. The horn-crew hastily swung their piece around at the Terrans, pumping frantically.  "What do you suppose I said?" Lillian asked.  "Oh, something like, 'Curse your gods, death to your king, and spit in your mother's face,' I suppose."  "Let me try it," Gofredo said.  The little Marine major went through the same routine. At his first word, the uproar stopped; before he was through, the natives' faces were sagging and crumbling into expressions of utter and heartbroken grief.  "It's not as bad as all that, is it?" he said. "You try it, Mark."  "Me ... Mark ... Howell...." They looked bewildered.  "Let's try objects, and play-acting," Lillian suggested. "They're farmers; they ought to have a word for water."         *       *       *       *       *  They spent almost an hour at it. They poured out two gallons of water, pretended to be thirsty, gave each other drinks. The natives simply couldn't agree on the word, in their own language, for water. That or else they missed the point of the whole act. They tried fire, next. The efficiency of a steel hatchet was impressive, and so was the sudden flame of a pocket-lighter, but no word for fire emerged, either.  "Ah, to Nifflheim with it!" Luis Gofredo cried in exasperation. "We're getting nowhere at five times light speed. Give them their presents and send them home, Paul."  "Sheath-knives; they'll have to be shown how sharp they are," he suggested. "Red bandannas. And costume jewelry."  "How about something to eat, Bennet?" Meillard asked Fayon.  "Extee Three, and C-H trade candy," Fayon said. Field Ration, Extraterrestrial Service, Type Three, could be eaten by anything with a carbon-hydrogen metabolism, and so could the trade candy. "Nothing else, though, till we have some idea what goes on inside them."  Dorver thought the six members of the delegation would be persons of special consequence, and should have something extra. That was probably so. Dorver was as quick to pick up clues to an alien social order as he was, himself, to deduce a culture pattern from a few artifacts. He and Lillian went back to the landing craft to collect the presents.  Everybody, horn-detail, armed guard and all, got one ten-inch bowie knife and sheath, a red bandanna neckcloth, and a piece of flashy junk jewelry. The (town council? prominent citizens? or what?) also received a colored table-spread apiece; these were draped over their shoulders and fastened with two-inch plastic pins advertising the candidacy of somebody for President of the Federation Member Republic of Venus a couple of elections ago. They all looked woebegone about it; that would be their expression of joy. Different type nerves and different facial musculature, Fayon thought. As soon as they sampled the Extee Three and candy, they looked crushed under all the sorrows of the galaxy.  By pantomime and pointing to the sun, Meillard managed to inform them that the next day, when the sun was in the same position, the Terrans would visit their village, bringing more gifts. The natives were quite agreeable, but Meillard was disgruntled that he had to use sign-talk. The natives started off toward the village on the mound, munching Extee Three and trying out their new knives. This time tomorrow, half of them would have bandaged thumbs.         *       *       *       *       *  The Marine riflemen and submachine-gunners were coming in, slinging their weapons and lighting cigarettes. A couple of Navy technicians were getting a snooper--a thing shaped like a short-tailed tadpole, six feet long by three at the widest, fitted with visible-light and infra-red screen pickups and crammed with detection instruments--ready to relieve the combat car over the village. The contact team crowded into the Number One landing craft, which had been fitted out as a temporary headquarters. Prefab-hut elements were already being unloaded from the other craft.  Everybody felt that a drink was in order, even if it was two hours short of cocktail time. They carried bottles and glasses and ice to the front of the landing craft and sat down in front of the battery of view and communication screens. The central screen was a two-way, tuned to one in the officers' lounge aboard the _Hubert Penrose_, two hundred miles above. In it, also provided with drinks, were Captain Guy Vindinho and two other Navy officers, and a Marine captain in shipboard blues. Like Gofredo, Vindinho must have gotten into the Service on tiptoe; he had a bald dome and a red beard, and he always looked as though he were gloating because nobody knew that his name was really Rumplestiltskin. He had been watching the contact by screen. He lifted his glass toward Meillard.  "Over the hump, Paul?"  Meillard raised his drink to Vindinho. "Over the first one. There's a whole string of them ahead. At least, we sent them away happy. I hope."  "You're going to make permanent camp where you are now?" one of the other officers asked. Lieutenant-Commander Dave Questell; ground engineering and construction officer. "What do you need?"  There were two viewscreens from pickups aboard the 2500-foot battle cruiser. One, at ten-power magnification, gave a maplike view of the broad valley and the uplands and mountain foothills to the south. It was only by tracing the course of the main river and its tributaries that they could find the tiny spot of the native village, and they couldn't see the landing craft at all. The other, at a hundred power, showed the oblong mound, with the village on its flat top, little dots around a circular central plaza. They could see the two turtle-shaped landing-craft, and the combat car, that had been circling over the mound, landing beside them, and, sometimes, a glint of sunlight from the snooper that had taken its place.  The snooper was also transmitting in, to another screen, from two hundred feet above the village. From the sound outlet came an incessant gibber of native voices. There were over a hundred houses, all small and square, with pyramidal roofs. On the end of the mound toward the Terran camp, animals of at least four different species were crowded, cattle that had been herded up from the meadows at the first alarm. The open circle in the middle of the village was crowded, and more natives lined the low palisade along the edge of the mound.  "Well, we're going to stay here till we learn the language," Meillard was saying. "This is the best place for it. It's completely isolated, forests on both sides, and seventy miles to the nearest other village. If we're careful, we can stay here as long as we want to and nobody'll find out about us. Then, after we can talk with these people, we'll go to the big town."         *       *       *       *       *  The big town was two hundred and fifty miles down the valley, at the forks of the main river, a veritable metropolis of almost three thousand people. That was where the treaty would have to be negotiated.  [Illustration: "... But no two of them speak the same language!"]  "You'll want more huts. You'll want a water tank, and a pipeline to that stream below you, and a pump," Questell said. "You think a month?"  Meillard looked at Lillian Ransby. "What do you think?"  "_Poodly-doodly-oodly-foodle_," she said. "You saw how far we didn't get this afternoon. All we found out was that none of the standard procedures work at all." She made a tossing gesture over her shoulder. "There goes the book; we have to do it off the cuff from here."  "Suppose we make another landing, back in the mountains, say two or three hundred miles south of you," Vindinho said. "It's not right to keep the rest aboard two hundred miles off planet, and you won't be wanting liberty parties coming down where you are."  "The country over there looks uninhabited," Meillard said. "No villages, anyhow. That wouldn't hurt, at all."  "Well, it'll suit me," Charley Loughran, the xeno-naturalist, said. "I want a chance to study the life-forms in a state of nature."  Vindinho nodded. "Luis, do you anticipate any trouble with this crowd here?" he asked.  "How about it, Mark? What do they look like to you? Warlike?"  "No." He stated the opinion he had formed. "I had a close look at their weapons when they came in for their presents. Hunting arms. Most of the spears have cross-guards, usually wooden, lashed on, to prevent a wounded animal from running up the spear-shaft at the hunter. They made boar-spears like that on Terra a thousand years ago. Maybe they have to fight raiding parties from the hills once in a while, but not often enough for them to develop special fighting weapons or techniques."  "Their village is fortified," Meillard mentioned.  "I question that," Gofredo differed. "There won't be more than a total of five hundred there; call that a fighting strength of two hundred, to defend a twenty-five-hundred-meter perimeter, with woodchoppers' axes and bows and spears. If you notice, there's no wall around the village itself. That palisade is just a fence."  "Why would they mound the village up?" Questell, in the screen wondered. "You don't think the river gets up that high, do you? Because if it does--"  Schallenmacher shook his head. "There just isn't enough watershed, and there's too much valley. I'll be very much surprised if that stream, there"--he nodded at the hundred-power screen--"ever gets more than six inches over the bank."  "I don't know what those houses are built of. This is all alluvial country; building stone would be almost unobtainable. I don't see anything like a brick kiln. I don't see any evidence of irrigation, either, so there must be plenty of rainfall. If they use adobe, or sun-dried brick, houses would start to crumble in a few years, and they would be pulled down and the rubble shoved aside to make room for a new house. The village has been rising on its own ruins, probably shifting back and forth from one end of that mound to the other."  "If that's it, they've been there a long time," Karl Dorver said. "And how far have they advanced?"  "Early bronze; I'll bet they still use a lot of stone implements. Pre-dynastic Egypt, or very early Tigris-Euphrates, in Terran terms. I can't see any evidence that they have the wheel. They have draft animals; when we were coming down, I saw a few of them pulling pole travoises. I'd say they've been farming for a long time. They have quite a diversity of crops, and I suspect that they have some idea of crop-rotation. I'm amazed at their musical instruments; they seem to have put more skill into making them than anything else. I'm going to take a jeep, while they're all in the village, and have a look around the fields, now."  Charley Loughran went along for specimens, and, for the ride, Lillian Ransby. Most of his guesses, he found, had been correct. He found a number of pole travoises, from which the animals had been unhitched in the first panic when the landing craft had been coming down. Some of them had big baskets permanently attached. There were drag-marks everywhere in the soft ground, but not a single wheel track. He found one plow, cunningly put together with wooden pegs and rawhide lashings; the point was stone, and it would only score a narrow groove, not a proper furrow. It was, however, fitted with a big bronze ring to which a draft animal could be hitched. Most of the cultivation seemed to have been done with spades and hoes. He found a couple of each, bronze, cast flat in an open-top mold. They hadn't learned to make composite molds.  There was an even wider variety of crops than he had expected: two cereals, a number of different root-plants, and a lot of different legumes, and things like tomatoes and pumpkins.  "Bet these people had a pretty good life, here--before the Terrans came," Charley observed.  "Don't say that in front of Paul," Lillian warned. "He has enough to worry about now, without starting him on whether we'll do these people more harm than good."  Two more landing craft had come down from the _Hubert Penrose_; they found Dave Questell superintending the unloading of more prefab-huts, and two were already up that had been brought down with the first landing.  A name for the planet had also arrived.  "Svantovit," Karl Dorver told him. "Principal god of the Baltic Slavs, about three thousand years ago. Guy Vindinho dug it out of the 'Encyclopedia of Mythology.' Svantovit was represented as holding a bow in one hand and a horn in the other."  "Well, that fits. What will we call the natives; Svantovitians, or Svantovese?"  "Well, Paul wanted to call them Svantovese, but Luis persuaded him to call them Svants. He said everybody'd call them that, anyhow, so we might as well make it official from the start."  "We can call the language Svantovese," Lillian decided. "After dinner, I am going to start playing back recordings and running off audiovisuals. I will be so happy to know that I have a name for what I'm studying. Probably be all I will know."         *       *       *       *       *  After dinner, he and Karl and Paul went into a huddle on what sort of gifts to give the natives, and the advisability of trading with them, and for what. Nothing too far in advance of their present culture level. Wheels; they could be made in the fabricating shop aboard the ship.  "You know, it's odd," Karl Dorver said. "These people here have never seen a wheel, and, except in documentary or historical-drama films, neither have a lot of Terrans."  That was true. As a means of transportation, the wheel had been completely obsolete since the development of contragravity, six centuries ago. Well, a lot of Terrans in the Year Zero had never seen a suit of armor, or an harquebus, or even a tinder box or a spinning wheel.  Wheelbarrows; now there was something they'd find useful. He screened Max Milzer, in charge of the fabricating and repair shops on the ship. Max had never even heard of a wheelbarrow.  "I can make them up, Mark; better send me some drawings, though. Did you just invent it?"  "As far as I know, a man named Leonardo da Vinci invented it, in the Sixth Century Pre-Atomic. How soon can you get me half a dozen of them?"  "Well, let's see. Welded sheet metal, and pipe for the frame and handles. I'll have some of them for you by noon tomorrow. Now, about hoes; how tall are these people, and how long are their arms, and how far can they stoop over?"         *       *       *       *       *  They were all up late, that night. So were the Svants; there was a fire burning in the middle of the village, and watch-fires along the edge of the mound. Luis Gofredo was just as distrustful of them as they were of the Terrans; he kept the camp lighted, a strong guard on the alert, and the area of darkness beyond infra red lighted and covered by photoelectric sentries on the ground and snoopers in the air. Like Paul Meillard, Luis Gofredo was a worrier and a pessimist. Everything happened for the worst in this worst of all possible galaxies, and if anything could conceivably go wrong, it infallibly would. That was probably why he was still alive and had never had a command massacred.  The wheelbarrows, four of them, came down from the ship by midmorning. With them came a grindstone, a couple of crosscut saws, and a lot of picks and shovels and axes, and cases of sheath knives and mess gear and miscellaneous trade goods, including a lot of the empty wine and whisky bottles that had been hoarded for the past four years.  At lunch, the talk was almost exclusively about the language problem. Lillian Ransby, who had not gotten to sleep before sunrise and had just gotten up, was discouraged.  "I don't know what we're going to do next," she admitted. "Glenn Orent and Anna and I were on it all night, and we're nowhere. We have about a hundred wordlike sounds isolated, and twenty or so are used repeatedly, and we can't assign a meaning to any of them. And none of the Svants ever reacted the same way twice to anything we said to them. There's just no one-to-one relationship anywhere."  "I'm beginning to doubt they have a language," the Navy intelligence officer said. "Sure, they make a lot of vocal noise. So do chipmunks."  "They have to have a language," Anna de Jong declared. "No sapient thought is possible without verbalization."  "Well, no society like that is possible without some means of communication," Karl Dorver supported her from the other flank. He seemed to have made that point before. "You know," he added, "I'm beginning to wonder if it mightn't be telepathy."  He evidently hadn't suggested that before. The others looked at him in surprise. Anna started to say, "Oh, I doubt if--" and then stopped.  "I know, the race of telepaths is an old gimmick that's been used in new-planet adventure stories for centuries, but maybe we've finally found one."  "I don't like it, Karl," Loughran said. "If they're telepaths, why don't they understand us? And if they're telepaths, why do they talk at all? And you can't convince me that this boodly-oodly-doodle of theirs isn't talking."  "Well, our neural structure and theirs won't be nearly alike," Fayon said. "I know, this analogy between telepathy and radio is full of holes, but it's good enough for this. Our wave length can't be picked up with their sets."  "The deuce it can't," Gofredo contradicted. "I've been bothered about that from the beginning. These people act as though they got meaning from us. Not the meaning we intend, but some meaning. When Paul made the gobbledygook speech, they all reacted in the same way--frightened, and then defensive. The you-me routine simply bewildered them, as we'd be at a set of semantically lucid but self-contradictory statements. When Lillian tried to introduce herself, they were shocked and horrified...."  "It looked to me like actual physical disgust," Anna interpolated.  "When I tried it, they acted like a lot of puppies being petted, and when Mark tried it, they were simply baffled. I watched Mark explaining that steel knives were dangerously sharp; they got the demonstration, but when he tried to tie words onto it, it threw them completely."  "ALL RIGHT. Pass that," Loughran conceded. "But if they have telepathy, why do they use spoken words?"  "Oh, I can answer that," Anna said. "Say they communicated by speech originally, and developed their telepathic faculty slowly and without realizing it. They'd go on using speech, and since the message would be received telepathically ahead of the spoken message, nobody would pay any attention to the words as such. Everybody would have a spoken language of his own; it would be sort of the instrumental accompaniment to the song."  "Some of them don't bother speaking," Karl nodded. "They just toot."  "I'll buy that, right away," Loughran agreed. "In mating, or in group-danger situations, telepathy would be a race-survival characteristic. It would be selected for genetically, and the non-gifted strains would tend to die out."  It wouldn't do. It wouldn't do at all. He said so.  "Look at their technology. We either have a young race, just emerged from savagery, or an old, stagnant race. All indications seem to favor the latter. A young race would not have time to develop telepathy as Anna suggests. An old race would have gone much farther than these people have. Progress is a matter of communication and pooling ideas and discoveries. Make a trend-graph of technological progress on Terra; every big jump comes after an improvement in communications. The printing press; railways and steamships; the telegraph; radio. Then think how telepathy would speed up progress."         *       *       *       *       *  The sun was barely past noon meridian before the Svants, who had ventured down into the fields at sunrise, were returning to the mound-village. In the snooper-screen, they could be seen coming up in tunics and breechclouts, entering houses, and emerging in long robes. There seemed to be no bows or spears in evidence, but the big horn sounded occasionally. Paul Meillard was pleased. Even if it had been by sign-talk, which he rated with worm-fishing for trout or shooting sitting rabbits, he had gotten something across to them.  When they went to the village, at 1500, they had trouble getting their lorry down. A couple of Marines in a jeep had to go in first to get the crowd out of the way. Several of the locals, including the one with the staff, joined with them; this quick co-operation delighted Meillard. When they had the lorry down and were all out of it, the dignitary with the staff, his scarlet tablecloth over his yellow robe, began an oration, apparently with every confidence that he was being understood. In spite of his objections at lunch, the telepathy theory was beginning to seem more persuasive.  "Give them the Shooting of Dan McJabberwock again," he told Meillard. "This is where we came in yesterday."  Something Meillard had noticed was exciting him. "Wait a moment. They're going to do something."  They were indeed. The one with the staff and three of his henchmen advanced. The staff bearer touched himself on the brow. "_Fwoonk_," he said. Then he pointed to Meillard. "_Hoonkle_," he said.  "They got it!" Lillian was hugging herself joyfully. "I knew they ought to!"  Meillard indicated himself and said, "_Fwoonk_."  That wasn't right. The village elder immediately corrected him. The word, it seemed, was, "_Fwoonk_."  His three companions agreed that that was the word for self, but that was as far as the agreement went. They rendered it, respectively, as "_Pwink_," "_Tweelt_" and "_Kroosh_."  Gofredo gave a barking laugh. He was right; anything that could go wrong would go wrong. Lillian used a word; it was not a ladylike word at all. The Svants looked at them as though wondering what could possibly be the matter. Then they went into a huddle, arguing vehemently. The argument spread, like a ripple in a pool; soon everybody was twittering vocally or blowing on flutes and Panpipes. Then the big horn started blaring. Immediately, Gofredo snatched the hand-phone of his belt radio and began speaking urgently into it.  "What are you doing, Luis?" Meillard asked anxiously.  "Calling the reserve in. I'm not taking chances on this." He spoke again into the phone, then called over his shoulder: "Rienet; three one-second bursts, in the air!"  A Marine pointed a submachine gun skyward and ripped off a string of shots, then another, and another. There was silence after the first burst. Then a frightful howling arose.  "Luis, you imbecile!" Meillard was shouting.  Gofredo jumped onto the top of an airjeep, where they could all see him; drawing his pistol, he fired twice into the air.  "Be quiet, all of you!" he shouted, as though that would do any good.  It did. Silence fell, bounced noisily, and then settled over the crowd. Gofredo went on talking to them: "Take it easy, now; easy." He might have been speaking to a frightened dog or a fractious horse. "Nobody's going to hurt you. This is nothing but the great noise-magic of the Terrans...."  "Get the presents unloaded," Meillard was saying. "Make a big show of it. The table first."  The horn, which had started, stopped blowing. As they were getting off the long table and piling it with trade goods, another lorry came in, disgorging twenty Marine riflemen. They had their bayonets fixed; the natives looked apprehensively at the bare steel, but went on listening to Gofredo. Meillard pulled the (Lord Mayor? Archbishop? Lord of the Manor?) aside, and began making sign-talk to him.  When quiet was restored, Howell put a pick and shovel into a wheelbarrow and pushed them out into the space that had been cleared in front of the table. He swung the pick for a while, then shoveled the barrow full of ground. After pushing it around for a while, he dumped it back in the hole and leveled it off. Two Marines brought out an eight-inch log and chopped a couple of billets off it with an ax, then cut off another with one of the saws, split them up, and filled the wheelbarrow with the firewood.  [Illustration: _We can't use the computer till we can tell it what the data is data about!_]  The knives, jewelry and other small items would be no problem; they had enough of them to go around. The other stuff would be harder to distribute, and Paul Meillard and Karl Dorver were arguing about how to handle it. If they weren't careful, a lot of new bowie knives would get bloodied.  "Have them form a queue," Anna suggested. "That will give them the idea of equal sharing, and we'll be able to learn something about their status levels and social hierarchy and agonistic relations."         *       *       *       *       *  The one with the staff took it as a matter of course that he would go first; his associates began falling in behind him, and the rest of the villagers behind them. Whether they'd gotten one the day before or not, everybody was given a knife and a bandanna and one piece of flashy junk-jewelry, also a stainless steel cup and mess plate, a bucket, and an empty bottle with a cork. The women didn't carry sheath knives, so they got Boy Scout knives on lanyards. They were all lavishly supplied with Extee Three and candy. Any of the children who looked big enough to be trusted with them got knives too, and plenty of candy.  Anna and Karl were standing where the queue was forming, watching how they fell into line; so was Lillian, with an audiovisual camera. Having seen that the Marine enlisted men were getting the presents handed out properly, Howell strolled over to them. Just as he came up, a couple approached hesitantly, a man in a breechclout under a leather apron, and a woman, much smaller, in a ragged and soiled tunic. As soon as they fell into line, another Svant, in a blue robe, pushed them aside and took their place.  "Here, you can't do that!" Lillian cried. "Karl, make him step back."  Karl was saying something about social status and precedence. The couple tried to get into line behind the man who had pushed them aside. Another villager tried to shove them out of his way. Howell advanced, his right fist closing. Then he remembered that he didn't know what he'd be punching; he might break the fellow's neck, or his own knuckles. He grabbed the blue-robed Svant by the wrist with both hands, kicked a foot out from under him, and jerked, sending him flying for six feet and then sliding in the dust for another couple of yards. He pushed the others back, and put the couple into place in the line.  "Mark, you shouldn't have done that," Dorver was expostulating. "We don't know...."  The Svant sat up, shaking his head groggily. Then he realized what had been done to him. With a snarl of rage, he was on his feet, his knife in his hand. It was a Terran bowie knife. Without conscious volition, Howell's pistol was out and he was thumbing the safety off.  The Svant stopped short, then dropped the knife, ducked his head, and threw his arms over it to shield his comb. He backed away a few steps, then turned and bolted into the nearest house. The others, including the woman in the ragged tunic, were twittering in alarm. Only the man in the leather apron was calm; he was saying, tonelessly, "_Ghrooogh-ghrooogh_."  Luis Gofredo was coming up on the double, followed by three of his riflemen.  "What happened, Mark? Trouble?"  "All over now." He told Gofredo what had happened. Dorver was still objecting:  "... Social precedence; the Svant may have been right, according to local customs."  "Local customs be damned!" Gofredo became angry. "This is a Terran Federation handout; we make the rules, and one of them is, no pushing people out of line. Teach the buggers that now and we won't have to work so hard at it later." He called back over his shoulder, "Situation under control; get the show going again."  The natives were all grimacing heartbrokenly with pleasure. Maybe the one who got thrown on his ear--no, he didn't have any--was not one of the more popular characters in the village.  "You just pulled your gun, and he dropped the knife and ran?" Gofredo asked. "And the others were scared, too?"  "That's right. They all saw you fire yours; the noise scared them."  Gofredo nodded. "We'll avoid promiscuous shooting, then. No use letting them find out the noise won't hurt them any sooner than we have to."  Paul Meillard had worked out a way to distribute the picks and shovels and axes. Considering each house as representing a family unit, which might or might not be the case, there were picks and shovels enough to go around, and an ax for every third house. They took them around in an airjeep and left them at the doors. The houses, he found, weren't adobe at all. They were built of logs, plastered with adobe on the outside. That demolished his theory that the houses were torn down periodically, and left the mound itself unexplained.  The wheelbarrows and the grindstone and the two crosscut saws were another matter. Nobody was quite sure that the (nobility? capitalist-class? politicians? prominent citizens?) wouldn't simply appropriate them for themselves. Paul Meillard was worried about that; everybody else was willing to let matters take their course. Before they were off the ground in their vehicles, a violent dispute had begun, with a bedlam of jabbering and shrieking. By the time they were landing at the camp, the big laminated leather horn had begun to bellow.         *       *       *       *       *  One of the huts had been fitted as contact-team headquarters, with all the view and communication screens installed, and one end partitioned off and soundproofed for Lillian to study recordings in. It was cocktail time when they returned; conversationally, it was a continuation from lunch. Karl Dorver was even more convinced than ever of his telepathic hypothesis, and he had completely converted Anna de Jong to it.  "Look at that." He pointed at the snooper screen, which gave a view of the plaza from directly above. "They're reaching an agreement already."  So they seemed to be, though upon what was less apparent. The horn had stopped, and the noise was diminishing. The odd thing was that peace was being restored, or was restoring itself, as the uproar had begun--outwardly from the center of the plaza to the periphery of the crowd. The same thing had happened when Gofredo had ordered the submachine gun fired, and, now that he recalled, when he had dealt with the line-crasher.  "Suppose a few of them, in the middle, are agreed," Anna said. "They are all thinking in unison, combining their telepathic powers. They dominate those nearest to them, who join and amplify their telepathic signal, and it spreads out through the whole group. A mental chain-reaction."  "That would explain the mechanism of community leadership, and I'd been wondering about that," Dorver said, becoming more excited. "It's a mental aristocracy; an especially gifted group of telepaths, in agreement and using their powers in concert, implanting their opinions in the minds of all the others. I'll bet the purpose of the horn is to distract the thoughts of the others, so that they can be more easily dominated. And the noise of the shots shocked them out of communication with each other; no wonder they were frightened."  Bennet Fayon was far from convinced. "So far, this telepathy theory is only an assumption. I find it a lot easier to assume some fundamental difference between the way they translate sound into sense-data and the way we do. We _think_ those combs on top of their heads are their external hearing organs, but we have no idea what's back of them, or what kind of a neural hookup is connected to them. I wish I knew how these people dispose of their dead. I need a couple of fresh cadavers. Too bad they aren't warlike. Nothing like a good bloody battle to advance the science of anatomy, and what we don't know about Svant anatomy is practically the entire subject."  "I should imagine the animals hear in the same way," Meillard said. "When the wagon wheels and the hoes and the blacksmith tools come down from the ship, we'll trade for cattle."  "When they make the second landing in the mountains, I'm going to do a lot of hunting," Loughran added. "I'll get wild animals for you."  "Well, I'm going to assume that the vocal noises they make are meaningful speech," Lillian Ransby said. "So far, I've just been trying to analyze them for phonetic values. Now I'm going to analyze them for sound-wave patterns. No matter what goes on inside their private nervous systems, the sounds exist as waves in the public atmosphere. I'm going to assume that the Lord Mayor and his stooges were all trying to say the same thing when they were pointing to themselves, and I'm going to see if all four of those sounds have any common characteristic."  By the time dinner was over, they were all talking in circles, none of them hopefully. They all made recordings of the speech about the slithy toves in the Malemute Saloon; Lillian wanted to find out what was different about them. Luis Gofredo saw to it that the camp itself would be visible-lighted, and beyond the lights he set up more photoelectric robot sentries and put a couple of snoopers to circling on contragravity, with infra-red lights and receptors. He also insisted that all his own men and all Dave Questell's Navy construction engineers keep their weapons ready to hand. The natives in the village were equally distrustful. They didn't herd the cattle up from the meadows where they had been pastured, but they lighted watch-fires along the edge of the mound as soon as it became dark.         *       *       *       *       *  It was three hours after nightfall when something on the indicator-board for the robot sentries went off like a startled rattlesnake. Everybody, talking idly or concentrating on writing up the day's observations, stiffened. Luis Gofredo, dozing in a chair, was on his feet instantly and crossing the hut to the instruments. His second-in-command, who had been playing chess with Willi Schallenmacher, rose and snatched his belt from the back of his chair, putting it on.  "Take it easy," Gofredo said. "Probably just a cow or a horse--local equivalent--that's strayed over from the other side."  He sat down in front of one of the snooper screens and twisted knobs on the remote controls. The monochrome view, transformed from infra red, rotated as the snooper circled and changed course. The other screen showed the camp receding and the area around it widening as its snooper gained altitude.  "It's not a big party," Gofredo was saying. "I can't see--Oh, yes I can. Only two of them."  The humanoid figures, one larger than the other, were moving cautiously across the fields, crouching low. The snooper went down toward them, and then he recognized them. The man and woman whom the blue-robed villager had tried to shove out of the queue, that afternoon. Gofredo recognized them, too.  "Your friends, Mark. Harry," he told his subordinate, "go out and pass the word around. Only two, and we think they're friendly. Keep everybody out of sight; we don't want to scare them away."  The snooper followed closely behind them. The man was no longer wearing his apron; the woman's tunic was even more tattered and soiled. She was leading him by the hand. Now and then, she would stop and turn her head to the rear. The snooper over the mound showed nothing but half a dozen fire-watchers dozing by their fires. Then the pair were at the edge of the camp lights. As they advanced, they seemed to realize that they had passed a point-of-no-return. They straightened and came forward steadily, the woman seeming to be guiding her companion.  "What's happening, Mark?"  It was Lillian; she must have just come out of the soundproof speech-lab.  "You know them; the pair in the queue, this afternoon. I think we've annexed a couple of friendly natives."  They all went outside. The two natives, having come into the camp, had stopped. For a moment, the man in the breechclout seemed undecided whether he was more afraid to turn and run than advance. The woman, holding his hand, led him forward. They were both bruised, and both had minor cuts, and neither of them had any of the things that had been given to them that afternoon.  "Rest of the gang beat them up and robbed them," Gofredo began angrily.  "See what you did?" Dorver began. "According to their own customs, they had no right to be ahead of those others, and now you've gotten them punished for it."  "I'd have done more to that fellow then Mark did, if I'd been there when it happened." The Marine officer turned to Meillard. "Look, this is your show, Paul; how you run it is your job. But in your place, I'd take that pair back to the village and have them point out who beat them up, and teach the whole gang of them a lesson. If you're going to colonize this planet, you're going to have to establish Federation law, and Federation law says you mustn't gang up on people and beat and rob them. We don't have to speak Svantese to make them understand what we'll put up with and what we won't."  "Later, Luis. After we've gotten a treaty with somebody." Meillard broke off. "Watch this!"  The woman was making sign-talk. She pointed to the village on the mound. Then, with her hands, she shaped a bucket like the ones that had been given to them, and made a snatching gesture away from herself. She indicated the neckcloths, and the sheath knife and the other things, and snatched them away too. She made beating motions, and touched her bruises and the man's. All the time, she was talking excitedly, in a high, shrill voice. The man made the same _ghroogh-ghroogh_ noises that he had that afternoon.  "No; we can't take any punitive action. Not now," Meillard said. "But we'll have to do something for them."  Vengeance, it seemed, wasn't what they wanted. The woman made vehement gestures of rejection toward the village, then bowed, placing her hands on her brow. The man imitated her obeisance, then they both straightened. The woman pointed to herself and to the man, and around the circle of huts and landing craft. She began scuttling about, picking up imaginary litter and sweeping with an imaginary broom. The man started pounding with an imaginary hammer, then chopping with an imaginary ax.  Lillian was clapping her hands softly. "Good; got it the first time. 'You let us stay; we work for you.' How about it, Paul?"  Meillard nodded. "Punitive action's unadvisable, but we will show our attitude by taking them in. You tell them, Luis; these people seem to like your voice."  Gofredo put a hand on each of their shoulders. "You ... stay ... with us." He pointed around the camp. "You ... stay ... this ... place."  Their faces broke into that funny just-before-tears expression that meant happiness with them. The man confined his vocal expressions to his odd _ghroogh-ghroogh_-ing; the woman twittered joyfully. Gofredo put a hand on the woman's shoulder, pointed to the man and from him back to her. "Unh?" he inquired.  The woman put a hand on the man's head, then brought it down to within a foot of the ground. She picked up the imaginary infant and rocked it in her arms, then set it down and grew it up until she had her hand on the top of the man's head again.  "That was good, Mom," Gofredo told her. "Now, you and Sonny come along; we'll issue you equipment and find you billets." He added, "What in blazes are we going to feed them; Extee Three?"         *       *       *       *       *  They gave them replacements for all the things that had been taken away from them. They gave the man a one-piece suit of Marine combat coveralls; Lillian gave the woman a lavender bathrobe, and Anna contributed a red scarf. They found them quarters in one end of a store shed, after making sure that there was nothing they could get at that would hurt them or that they could damage. They gave each of them a pair of blankets and a pneumatic mattress, which delighted them, although the cots puzzled them at first.  "What do you think about feeding them, Bennet?" Meillard asked, when the two Svants had gone to bed and they were back in the headquarters hut. "You said the food on this planet is safe for Terrans."  "So I did, and it is, but the rule's not reversible. Things we eat might kill them," Fayon said. "Meats will be especially dangerous. And no caffein, and no alcohol."  "Alcohol won't hurt them," Schallenmacher said. "I saw big jars full of fermenting fruit-mash back of some of those houses; in about a year, it ought to be fairly good wine. C_{2}H_{5}OH is the same on any planet."  "Well, we'll get native foodstuffs tomorrow," Meillard said. "We'll have to do that by signs, too," he regretted.  "Get Mom to help you; she's pretty sharp," Lillian advised. "But I think Sonny's the village half-wit."  Anna de Jong agreed. "Even if we don't understand Svant psychology, that's evident; he's definitely subnormal. The way he clings to his mother for guidance is absolutely pathetic. He's a mature adult, but mentally he's still a little child."  "That may explain it!" Dorver cried. "A mental defective, in a community of telepaths, constantly invading the minds of others with irrational and disgusting thoughts; no wonder he is rejected and persecuted. And in a community on this culture level, the mother of an abnormal child is often regarded with superstitious detestation--"  [Illustration]  "Yes, of course!" Anna de Jong instantly agreed, and began to go into the villagers' hostility to both mother and son; both of them were now taking the telepathy hypothesis for granted.  Well, maybe so. He turned to Lillian.  "What did you find out?"  "Well, there is a common characteristic in all four sounds. A little patch on the screen at seventeen-twenty cycles. The odd thing is that when I try to repeat the sound, it isn't there."  Odd indeed. If a Svant said something, he made sound waves; if she imitated the sound, she ought to imitate the wave pattern. He said so, and she agreed.  "But come back here and look at this," she invited.  She had been using a visibilizing analyzer; in it, a sound was broken by a set of filters into frequency-groups, translated into light from dull red to violet paling into pure white. It photographed the light-pattern on high-speed film, automatically developed it, and then made a print-copy and projected the film in slow motion on a screen. When she pressed a button, a recorded voice said, "_Fwoonk_." An instant later, a pattern of vertical lines in various colors and lengths was projected on the screen.  "Those green lines," she said. "That's it. Now, watch this."  She pressed another button, got the photoprint out of a slot, and propped it beside the screen. Then she picked up a hand-phone and said, "_Fwoonk_," into it. It sounded like the first one, but the pattern that danced onto the screen was quite different. Where the green had been, there was a patch of pale-blue lines. She ran the other three Svants' voices, each saying, presumably, "Me." Some were mainly up in blue, others had a good deal of yellow and orange, but they all had the little patch of green lines.  "Well, that seems to be the information," he said. "The rest is just noise."  "Maybe one of them is saying, 'John Doe, _me_, son of Joe Blow,' and another is saying, 'Tough guy, _me_; lick anybody in town.'"  "All in one syllable?" Then he shrugged. How did he know what these people could pack into one syllable? He picked up the hand-phone and said, "Fwoonk," into it. The pattern, a little deeper in color and with longer lines, was recognizably like hers, and unlike any of the Svants'.         *       *       *       *       *  The others came in, singly and in pairs and threes. They watched the colors dance on the screen to picture the four Svant words which might or might not all mean _me_. They tried to duplicate them. Luis Gofredo and Willi Schallenmacher came closest of anybody. Bennet Fayon was still insisting that the Svants had a perfectly comprehensible language--to other Svants. Anna de Jong had started to veer a little away from the Dorver Hypothesis. There was a difference between event-level sound, which was a series of waves of alternately crowded and rarefied molecules of air, and object-level sound, which was an auditory sensation inside the nervous system, she admitted. That, Fayon crowed, was what he'd been saying all along; their auditory system was probably such that _fwoonk_ and _pwink_ and _tweelt_ and _kroosh_ all sounded alike to them.  By this time, _fwoonk_ and _pwink_ and _tweelt_ and _kroosh_ had become swear words among the joint Space Navy-Colonial Office contact team.  "Well, if I hear the two sounds alike, why doesn't the analyzer hear them alike?" Karl Dorver demanded.  "It has better ears than you do, Karl. Look how many different frequencies there are in that word, all crowding up behind each other," Lillian said. "But it isn't sensitive or selective enough. I'm going to see what Ayesha Keithley can do about building me a better one."  Ayesha was signals and detection officer on the _Hubert Penrose_. Dave Questell mentioned that she'd had a hard day, and was probably making sack-time, and she wouldn't welcome being called at 0130. Nobody seemed to have realized that it had gotten that late.  "Well, I'll call the ship and have a recording made for her for when she gets up. But till we get something that'll sort this mess out and make sense of it, I'm stopped."  "You're stopped, period, Lillian," Dorver told her. "What these people gibber at us doesn't even make as much sense as the Shooting of Dan McJabberwock. The real information is conveyed by telepathy."         *       *       *       *       *  Lieutenant j.g. Ayesha Keithley was on the screen the next morning while they were eating breakfast. She was a blonde, like Lillian.  "I got your message; you seem to have problems, don't you?"  "Speaking conservatively, yes. You see what we're up against?"  "You don't know what their vocal organs are like, do you?" the girl in naval uniform in the screen asked.  Lillian shook her head. "Bennet Fayon's hoping for a war, or an epidemic, or something to break out, so that he can get a few cadavers to dissect."  "Well, he'll find that they're pretty complex," Ayesha Keithley said. "I identified stick-and-slip sounds and percussion sounds, and plucked-string sounds, along with the ordinary hiss-and-buzz speech-sounds. Making a vocoder to reproduce that speech is going to be fun. Just what are you using, in the way of equipment?"  Lillian was still talking about that when the two landing craft from the ship were sighted, coming down. Charley Loughran and Willi Schallenmacher, who were returning to the _Hubert Penrose_ to join the other landing party, began assembling their luggage. The others went outside, Howell among them.  Mom and Sonny were watching the two craft grow larger and closer above, keeping close to a group of spacemen; Sonny was looking around excitedly, while Mom clung to his arm, like a hen with an oversized chick. The reasoning was clear--these people knew all about big things that came down out of the sky and weren't afraid of them; stick close to them, and it would be perfectly safe. Sonny saw the contact team emerging from their hut and grabbed his mother's arm, pointing. They both beamed happily; that expression didn't look sad, at all, now that you knew what it meant. Sonny began ghroogh-ghrooghing hideously; Mom hushed him with a hand over his mouth, and they both made eating gestures, rubbed their abdomens comfortably, and pointed toward the mess hut. Bennet Fayon was frightened. He turned and started on the double toward the cook, who was standing in the doorway of the hut, calling out to him.  The cook spoke inaudibly. Fayon stopped short. "Unholy Saint Beelzebub, no!" he cried. The cook said something in reply, shrugging. Fayon came back, talking to himself.  "Terran carniculture pork," he said, when he returned. "Zarathustra pool-ball fruit. Potato-flour hotcakes, with Baldur honey and Odin flameberry jam. And two big cups of coffee apiece. It's a miracle they aren't dead now. If they're alive for lunch, we won't need to worry about feeding them anything we eat, but I'm glad somebody else has the moral responsibility for this."  Lillian Ransby came out of the headquarters hut. "Ayesha's coming down this afternoon, with a lot of equipment," she said. "We're not exactly going to count air molecules in the sound waves, but we'll do everything short of that. We'll need more lab space, soundproofed."  "Tell Dave Questell what you want," Meillard said. "Do you really think you can get anything?"  She shrugged. "If there's anything there to get. How long it'll take is another question."         *       *       *       *       *  The two sixty-foot collapsium-armored turtles settled to the ground and went off contragravity. The ports opened, and things began being floated off on lifter-skids: framework for the water tower, and curved titanium sheets for the tank. Anna de Jong said something about hot showers, and not having to take any more sponge-baths. Howell was watching the stuff come off the other landing craft. A dozen pairs of four-foot wagon wheels, with axles. Hoes, in bundles. Scythe blades. A hand forge, with a crank-driven fan blower, and a hundred and fifty pound anvil, and sledges and cutters and swages and tongs.  Everybody was busy, and Mom and Sonny were fidgeting, gesturing toward the work with their own empty hands. _Hey, boss; whatta we gonna do?_ He patted them on the shoulders.  "Take it easy." He hoped his tone would convey nonurgency. "We'll find something for you to do."  He wasn't particularly happy about most of what was coming off. Giving these Svants tools was fine, but it was more important to give them technologies. The people on the ship hadn't thought of that. These wheels, now; machined steel hubs, steel rims, tubular steel spokes, drop-forged and machined axles. The Svants wouldn't be able to copy them in a thousand years. Well, in a hundred, if somebody showed them where and how to mine iron and how to smelt and work it. And how to build a steam engine.  He went over and pulled a hoe out of one of the bundles. Blades stamped out with a power press, welded to tubular steel handles. Well, wood for hoe handles was hard to come by on a spaceship, even a battle cruiser almost half a mile in diameter; he had to admit that. And they were about two thousand per cent more efficient than the bronze scrapers the Svants used. That wasn't the idea, though. Even supposing that the first wave of colonists came out in a year and a half, it would be close to twenty years before Terran-operated factories would be in mass production for the native trade. The idea was to teach these people to make better things for themselves; give them a leg up, so that the next generation would be ready for contragravity and nuclear and electric power.  Mom didn't know what to make of any of it. Sonny did, though; he was excited, grabbing Howell's arm, pointing, saying, "_Ghroogh_! _Ghroogh_!" He pointed at the wheels, and then made a stooping, lifting and pushing gesture. _Like wheelbarrow?_  "That's right." He nodded, wondering if Sonny recognized that as an affirmative sign. "Like big wheelbarrow."  One thing puzzled Sonny, though. Wheelbarrow wheels were small--his hands indicated the size--and single. These were big, and double.  "Let me show you this, Sonny."  He squatted, took a pad and pencil from his pocket, and drew two pairs of wheels, and then put a wagon on them, and drew a quadruped hitched to it, and a Svant with a stick walking beside it. Sonny looked at the picture--Svants seemed to have pictoral sense, for which make us thankful!--and then caught his mother's sleeve and showed it to her. Mom didn't get it. Sonny took the pencil and drew another animal, with a pole travois. He made gestures. A travois dragged; it went slow. A wagon had wheels that went around; it went fast.  So Lillian and Anna thought he was the village half-wit. Village genius, more likely; the other peasants didn't understand him, and resented his superiority. They went over for a closer look at the wheels, and pushed them. Sonny was almost beside himself. Mom was puzzled, but she thought they were pretty wonderful.  Then they looked at blacksmith tools. Tongs; Sonny had never seen anything like them. Howell wondered what the Svants used to handle hot metal; probably big tweezers made by tying two green sticks together. There was an old Arabian legend that Allah had made the first tongs and given them to the first smith, because nobody could make tongs without having a pair already.  Sonny didn't understand the fan-blower until it was taken apart. Then he made a great discovery. The wheels, and the fan, and the pivoted tongs, all embodied the same principle, one his people had evidently never discovered. A whole new world seemed to open before him; from then on, he was constantly finding things pierced and rotating on pivots.         *       *       *       *       *  By this time, Mom was fidgeting again. She ought to be doing something to justify her presence in the camp. He was wondering what sort of work he could invent for her when Karl Dorver called to him from the door of the headquarters hut.  "Mark, can you spare Mom for a while?" he asked. "We want her to look at pictures and show us which of the animals are meat-cattle, and which of the crops are ripe."  "Think you can get anything out of her?"  "Sign-talk, yes. We may get a few words from her, too."  At first, Mom was unwilling to leave Sonny. She finally decided that it would be safe, and trotted over to Dorver, entering the hut.  Dave Questell's construction crew began at once on the water tank, using a power shovel to dig the foundation. They had to haul water in a tank from the river a quarter-mile away to mix the concrete. Sonny watched that interestedly. So did a number of the villagers, who gathered safely out of bowshot. They noticed Sonny among the Terrans and pointed at him. Sonny noticed that. He unobtrusively picked up a double-bitted ax and kept it to hand.  He and Mom had lunch with the contact team. As they showed no ill effects from breakfast, Fayon decided that it was safe to let them have anything the Terrans ate or drank. They liked wine; they knew what it was, all right, but this seemed to have a delightfully different flavor. They each tried a cigarette, choked over the first few puffs, and decided that they didn't like smoking.  "Mom gave us a lot of information, as far as she could, on the crops and animals. The big things, the size of rhinoceroses, are draft animals and nothing else; they're not eaten," Dorver said. "I don't know whether the meat isn't good, or is taboo, or they are too valuable to eat. They eat all the other three species, and milk two of them. I have an idea they grind their grain in big stone mortars as needed."  That was right; he'd seen things like that.  "Willi, when you're over in the mountains, see if you can find something we can make millstones out of. We can shape them with sono-cutters; after they get the idea, they can do it themselves by hand. One of those big animals could be used to turn the mill. Did you get any words from her?"  Paul Meillard shook his head gloomily. "Nothing we can be sure of. It was the same thing as in the village, yesterday. She'd say something, I'd repeat it, and she'd tell us it was wrong and say the same thing over again. Lillian took recordings; she got the same results as last night. Ask her about it later."  "She has the same effect on Mom as on the others?"  "Yes. Mom was very polite and tried not to show it, but--"  Lillian took him aside, out of earshot of the two Svants, after lunch. She was almost distracted.  "Mark, I don't know what I'm going to do. She's like the others. Every time I open my mouth in front of her, she's simply horrified. It's as though my voice does something loathsome to her. And I'm the one who's supposed to learn to talk to them."  "Well, those who can do, and those who can't teach," he told her. "You can study recordings, and tell us what the words are and teach us how to recognize and pronounce them. You're the only linguist we have."  That seemed to comfort her a little. He hoped it would work out that way. If they could communicate with these people and did leave a party here to prepare for the first colonization, he'd stay on, to teach the natives Terran technologies and study theirs. He'd been expecting that Lillian would stay, too. She was the linguist; she'd have to stay. But now, if it turned out that she would be no help but a liability, she'd go back with the _Hubert Penrose_. Paul wouldn't keep a linguist who offended the natives' every sensibility with every word she spoke. He didn't want that to happen. Lillian and he had come to mean a little too much to each other to be parted now.         *       *       *       *       *  Paul Meillard and Karl Dorver had considerable difficulty with Mom, that afternoon. They wanted her to go with them and help trade for cattle. Mom didn't want to; she was afraid. They had to do a lot of play-acting, with half a dozen Marines pretending to guard her with fixed bayonets from some of Dave Questell's Navy construction men who had red bandannas on their heads to simulate combs before she got the idea. Then she was afraid to get into the contragravity lorry that was to carry the hoes and the wagon wheels. Sonny managed to reassure her, and insisted on going along, and he insisted on taking his ax with him. That meant doubling the guard, to make sure Sonny didn't lose his self-control when he saw his former persecutors within chopping distance.  It went off much better than either Paul Meillard or Luis Gofredo expected. After the first shock of being air-borne had worn off, Mom found that she liked contragravity-riding; Sonny was wildly delighted with it from the start. The natives showed neither of them any hostility. Mom's lavender bathrobe and Sonny's green coveralls and big ax seemed to be symbols of a new and exalted status; even the Lord Mayor was extremely polite to them.  The Lord Mayor and half a dozen others got a contragravity ride, too, to the meadows to pick out cattle. A dozen animals, including a pair of the two-ton draft beasts, were driven to the Terran camp. A couple of lorry-loads of assorted vegetables were brought in, too. Everybody seemed very happy about the deal, especially Bennet Fayon. He wanted to slaughter one of the sheep-sized meat-and-milk animals at once and get to work on it. Gofredo advised him to put it off till the next morning. He wanted a large native audience to see the animal being shot with a rifle.  The water tower was finished, and the big spherical tank hoisted on top of it and made fast. A pump, and a filter-system were installed. There was no water for hot showers that evening, though. They would have to run a pipeline to the river, and that would entail a ditch that would cut through several cultivated fields, which, in turn, would provoke an uproar. Paul Meillard didn't want that happening until he'd concluded the cattle-trade.  Charley Loughran and Willi Schallenmacher had gone up to the ship on one of the landing craft; they accompanied the landing party that went down into the mountains. Ayesha Keithley arrived late in the afternoon on another landing craft, with five or six tons of instruments and parts and equipment, and a male Navy warrant-officer helper.  They looked around the lab Lillian had been using at one end of the headquarters hut.  "This won't do," the girl Navy officer said. "We can't get a quarter of the apparatus we're going to need in here. We'll have to build something."  Dave Questell was drawn into the discussion. Yes, he could put up something big enough for everything the girls would need to install, and soundproof it. Concrete, he decided; they'd have to wait till he got the water line down and the pump going, though.  There was a crowd of natives in the fields, gaping at the Terran camp, the next morning, and Gofredo decided to kill the animal--until they learned the native name, they were calling it Domesticated Type C. It was herded out where everyone could watch, and a Marine stepped forward unslung his rifle took a kneeling position, and aimed at it. It was a hundred and fifty yards away. Mom had come out to see what was going on; Sonny and Howell, who had been consulting by signs over the construction of a wagon, were standing side by side. The Marine squeezed his trigger. The rifle banged, and the Domesticated-C bounded into the air, dropped, and kicked a few times and was still. The natives, however, missed that part of it; they were howling piteously and rubbing their heads. All but Sonny. He was just mildly surprised at what had happened to the Dom.-C.  Sonny, it would appear, was stone deaf.         *       *       *       *       *  As anticipated, there was another uproar later in the morning when the ditching machine started north across the meadow. A mob of Svants, seeing its relentless progress toward a field of something like turnips, gathered in front of it, twittering and brandishing implements of agriculture, many of them Terran-made.  Paul Meillard was ready for this. Two lorries went out; one loaded with Marines, who jumped off with their rifles ready. By this time, all the Svants knew what rifles would do beside make a noise. Meillard, Dorver, Gofredo and a few others got out of the other vehicle, and unloaded presents. Gofredo did all the talking. The Svants couldn't understand him, but they liked it. They also liked the presents, which included a dozen empty half-gallon rum demijohns, tarpaulins, and a lot of assorted knickknacks. The pipeline went through.  He and Sonny got the forge set up. There was no fuel for it. A party of Marines had gone out to the woods to the east to cut wood; when they got back, they'd burn some charcoal in the pit that had been dug beside the camp. Until then, he and Sonny were drawing plans for a wooden wheel with a metal tire when Lillian came out of the headquarters hut with a clipboard under her arm. She motioned to him.  "Come on over," he told her. "You can talk in front of Sonny; he won't mind. He can't hear."  "Can't hear?" she echoed. "You mean--?"  "That's right. Sonny's stone deaf. He didn't even hear that rifle going off. The only one of this gang that has brains enough to pour sand out of a boot with directions on the bottom of the heel, and he's a total linguistic loss."  "So he isn't a half-wit, after all."  "He's got an IQ close to genius level. Look at this; he never saw a wheel before yesterday; now he's designing one."  [Illustration: _It's killing us it's so nice...._]  Lillian's eyes widened. "So that's why Mom's so sharp about sign-talk. She's been doing it all his life." Then she remembered what she had come out to show him, and held out the clipboard. "You know how that analyzer of mine works? Well, here's what Ayesha's going to do. After breaking a sound into frequency bands instead of being photographed and projected, each band goes to an analyzer of its own, and is projected on its own screen. There'll be forty of them, each for a band of a hundred cycles, from zero to four thousand. That seems to be the Svant vocal range."  The diagram passed from hand to hand during cocktail time, before dinner. Bennet Fayon had been working all day dissecting the animal they were all calling a _domsee_, a name which would stick even if and when they learned the native name. He glanced disinterestedly at the drawing, then looked again, more closely. Then he set down the drink he was holding in his other hand and studied it intently.  "You know what you have here?" he asked. "This is a very close analogy to the hearing organs of that animal I was working on. The comb, as we've assumed, is the external organ. It's covered with small flaps and fissures. Back of each fissure is a long, narrow membrane; they're paired, one on each side of the comb, and from them nerves lead to clusters of small round membranes. Nerves lead from them to a complex nerve-cable at the bottom of the comb and into the brain at the base of the skull. I couldn't understand how the system functioned, but now I see it. Each of the larger membranes on the outside responds to a sound-frequency band, and the small ones on the inside break the bands down to individual frequencies."  "How many of the little ones are there?" Ayesha asked.  "Thousands of them; the inner comb is simply packed with them. Wait; I'll show you."  He rose and went away, returning with a sheaf of photo-enlargements and a number of blocks of lucite in which specimens were mounted. Everybody examined them. Anna de Jong, as a practicing psychologist, had an M.D. and to get that she'd had to know a modicum of anatomy; she was puzzled.  "I can't understand how they hear with those things. I'll grant that the membranes will respond to sound, but I can't see how they transmit it."  "But they do hear," Meillard said. "Their musical instruments, their reactions to our voices, the way they are affected by sounds like gunfire--"  "They hear, but they don't hear in the same way we do," Fayon replied. "If you can't be convinced by anything else, look at these things, and compare them with the structure of the human ear, or the ear of any member of any other sapient race we're ever contacted. That's what I've been saying from the beginning."  "They have sound-perception to an extent that makes ours look almost like deafness," Ayesha Keithley said. "I wish I could design a sound-detector one-tenth as good as this must be."  Yes. The way the Lord Mayor said _fwoonk_ and the way Paul Meillard said it sounded entirely different to them. Of course, _fwoonk_ and _pwink_ and _tweelt_ and _kroosh_ sounded alike to them, but let's don't be too picky about things.         *       *       *       *       *  There were no hot showers that evening; Dave Questell's gang had trouble with the pump and needed some new parts made up aboard the ship. They were still working on it the next morning. He had meant to start teaching Sonny blacksmithing, but during the evening Lillian and Anna had decided to try teaching Mom a nonphonetic, ideographic, alphabet, and in the morning they co-opted Sonny to help. Deprived of his disciple, he strolled over to watch the work on the pump. About twenty Svants had come in from the fields and were also watching, from the meadow.  After a while, the job was finished. The petty officer in charge of the work pushed in the switch, and the pump started, sucking dry with a harsh racket. The natives twittered in surprise. Then the water came, and the pump settled down to a steady _thugg-thugg, thugg-thugg_.  The Svants seemed to like the new sound; they grimaced in pleasure and moved closer; within forty or fifty feet, they all squatted on the ground and sat entranced. Others came in from the fields, drawn by the sound. They, too, came up and squatted, until there was a semicircle of them. The tank took a long time to fill; until it did, they all sat immobile and fascinated. Even after it stopped, many remained, hoping that it would start again. Paul Meillard began wondering, a trifle uneasily, if that would happen every time the pump went on.  "They get a positive pleasure from it. It affects them the same way Luis' voice does."  "Mean I have a voice like a pump?" Gofredo demanded.  "Well, I'm going to find out," Ayesha Keithley said. "The next time that starts, I'm going to make a recording, and compare it with your voice-recording. I'll give five to one there'll be a similarity."  Questell got the foundation for the sonics lab dug, and began pouring concrete. That took water, and the pump ran continuously that afternoon. Concrete-mixing took more water the next day, and by noon the whole village population, down to the smallest child, was massed at the pumphouse, enthralled. Mom was snared by the sound like any of the rest; only Sonny was unaffected. Lillian and Ayesha compared recordings of the voices of the team with the pump-sound; in Gofredo's they found an identical frequency-pattern.  "We'll need the new apparatus to be positive about it, but it's there, all right," Ayesha said. "That's why Luis' voice pleases them."  "That tags me; Old Pump-Mouth," Gofredo said. "It'll get all through the Corps, and they'll be calling me that when I'm a four-star general, if I live that long."  Meillard was really worried, now. So was Bennet Fayon. He said so that afternoon at cocktail time.  "It's an addiction," he declared. "Once they hear it, they have no will to resist; they just squat and listen. I don't know what it's doing to them, but I'm scared of it."  "I know one thing it's doing," Meillard said. "It's keeping them from their work in the fields. For all we know, it may cause them to lose a crop they need badly for subsistence."         *       *       *       *       *  The native they had come to call the Lord Mayor evidently thought so, too. He was with the others, the next morning, squatting with his staff across his knees, as bemused as any of them, but when the pump stopped he rose and approached a group of Terrans, launching into what could only be an impassioned tirade. He pointed with his staff to the pump house, and to the semicircle of still motionless villagers. He pointed to the fields, and back to the people, and to the pump house again, gesturing vehemently with his other hand.  _You make the noise. My people will not work while they hear it. The fields lie untended. Stop the noise, and let my people work._  Couldn't possibly be any plainer.  Then the pump started again. The Lord Mayor's hands tightened on the staff; he was struggling tormentedly with himself, in vain. His face relaxed into the heartbroken expression of joy; he turned and shuffled over, dropping onto his haunches with the others.  "Shut down the pump, Dave!" Meillard called out. "Cut the power off."  The _thugg-thugg_-ing stopped. The Lord Mayor rose, made an odd salaamlike bow toward the Terrans, and then turned on the people, striking with his staff and shrieking at them. A few got to their feet and joined him, screaming, pushing, tugging. Others joined. In a little while, they were all on their feet, straggling away across the fields.  Dave Questell wanted to know what it meant; Meillard explained.  "Well, what are we going to do for water?" the Navy engineer asked.  "Soundproof the pump house. You can do that, can't you?"  "Sure. Mound it over with earth. We'll have that done in a few hours."  That started Gofredo worrying. "This happens every time we colonize an inhabited planet. We give the natives something new. Then we find out it's bad for them, and we try to take it away from them. And then the knives come out, and the shooting starts."  Luis Gofredo was also a specialist, speaking on his subject.         *       *       *       *       *  While they were at lunch, Charley Loughran screened in from the other camp and wanted to talk to Bennet Fayon.  "A funny thing, Bennet. I took a shot at a bird ... no, a flying mammal ... and dropped it. It was dead when it hit the ground, but there isn't a mark on it. I want you to do an autopsy, and find out how I can kill things by missing them."  "How far away was it?"  "Call it forty feet; no more."  "What were you using, Charley?" Ayesha Keithley called from the table.  "Eight-point-five Mars-Consolidated pistol," Loughran said. "I'd laid my shotgun down and walked away from it--"  "Twelve hundred foot-seconds," Ayesha said. "Bow-wave as well as muzzle-blast."  "You think the report was what did it?" Fayon asked.  "You want to bet it didn't?" she countered.  Nobody did.         *       *       *       *       *  Mom was sulky. She didn't like what Dave Questell's men were doing to the nice-noise-place. Ayesha and Lillian consoled her by taking her into the soundproofed room and playing the recording of the pump-noise for her. Sonny couldn't care less, one way or another; he spent the afternoon teaching Mark Howell what the marks on paper meant. It took a lot of signs and play-acting. He had learned about thirty ideographs; by combining them and drawing little pictures, he could express a number of simple ideas. There was, of course, a limit to how many of those things anybody could learn and remember--look how long it took an Old Terran Chinese scribe to learn his profession--but it was the beginning of a method of communication.  Questell got the pump house mounded over. Ayesha came out and tried a sound-meter, and also Mom, on it while the pump was running. Neither reacted.  A good many Svants were watching the work. They began to demonstrate angrily. A couple tried to interfere and were knocked down with rifle butts. The Lord Mayor and his Board of Aldermen came out with the big horn and harangued them at length, and finally got them to go back to the fields. As nearly as anybody could tell, he was friendly to and co-operative with the Terrans. The snooper over the village reported excitement in the plaza.  Bennet Fayon had taken an airjeep to the other camp immediately after lunch. He was back by 1500, accompanied by Loughran. They carried a cloth-wrapped package into Fayon's dissecting-room. At cocktail time, Paul Meillard had to go and get them.  "Sorry," Fayon said, joining the group. "Didn't notice how late it was getting. We're still doing a post on this svant-bat; that's what Charley's calling it, till we get the native name.  "The immediate cause of death was spasmodic contraction of every muscle in the thing's body; some of them were partly relaxed before we could get to work on it, but not completely. Every bone that isn't broken is dislocated; a good many both. There is not the slightest trace of external injury. Everything was done by its own muscles." He looked around. "I hope nobody covered Ayesha's bet, after I left. If they did, she collects. The large outer membranes in the comb seem to be unaffected, but there is considerable compression of the small round ones inside, in just one area, and more on the left side than on the right. Charley says it was flying across in front of him from left to right."  "The receptor-area responding to the frequencies of the report," Ayesha said.  Anna de Jong made a passing gesture toward Fayon. "The baby's yours, Bennet," she said. "This isn't psychological. I won't accept a case of psychosomatic compound fracture."  "Don't be too premature about it, Anna. I think that's more or less what you have, here."  Everybody looked at him, surprised. His subject was comparative technology. The bio and psycho-sciences were completely outside his field.  "A lot of things have been bothering me, ever since the first contact. I'm beginning to think I'm on the edge of understanding them, now. Bennet, the higher life-forms here--the people, and that domsee, and Charley's svant-bat--are structurally identical with us. I don't mean gross structure, like ears and combs. I mean molecular and cellular and tissue structure. Is that right?"  Fayon nodded. "Biology on this planet is exactly Terra type. Yes. With adequate safeguards, I'd even say you could make a viable tissue-graft from a Svant to a Terran, or vice versa."  "Ayesha, would the sound waves from that pistol-shot in any conceivable way have the sort of physical effect we're considering?"  "Absolutely not," she said, and Luis Gofredo said: "I've been shot at and missed with pistols at closer range than that."  "Then it was the effect on the animal's nervous system."  Anna shrugged. "It's still Bennet's baby. I'm a psychologist, not a neurologist."  "What I've been saying, all along," Fayon reiterated complacently. "Their hearing is different from ours. This proves it.  "It proves that they don't hear at all."  He had expected an explosion; he wasn't disappointed. They all contradicted him, many derisively. Signal reactions. Only Paul Meillard made the semantically appropriate response:  "What do you mean, Mark?"  "They don't _hear_ sound; they _feel_ it. You all saw what they have inside their combs. Those things don't transmit sound like the ears of any sound-sensitive life-form we've ever seen. They transform sound waves into tactile sensations."  Fayon cursed, slowly and luridly. Anna de Jong looked at him wide-eyed. He finished his cocktail and poured another. In the snooper screen, what looked like an indignation meeting was making uproar in the village plaza. Gofredo cut the volume of the speaker even lower.  "That would explain a lot of things," Meillard said slowly. "How hard it was for them to realize that we didn't understand when they talked to us. A punch in the nose feels the same to anybody. They thought they were giving us bodily feelings. They didn't know we were insensible to them."  "But they do ... they do have a language," Lillian faltered. "They talk."  "Not the way we understand it. If they want to say, 'Me,' it's _tickle-pinch-rub_, even if it sounds like _fwoonk_ to us, when it doesn't sound like _pwink_ or _tweelt_ or _kroosh_. The tactile sensations, to a Svant, feel no more different than a massage by four different hands. Analogous to a word pronounced by four different voices, to us. They'll have a code for expressing meanings in tactile sensation, just as we have a code for expressing meanings in audible sound."  "Except that when a Svant tells another, 'I am happy,' or 'I have a stomach-ache,' he makes the other one feel that way too," Anna said. "That would carry an awful lot more conviction. I don't imagine symptom-swapping is popular among Svants. Karl! You were nearly right, at that. This isn't telepathy, but it's a lot like it."  "So it is," Dorver, who had been mourning his departed telepathy theory, said brightly. "And look how it explains their society. Peaceful, everybody in quick agreement--" He looked at the screen and gulped. The Lord Mayor and his party had formed one clump, and the opposition was grouped at the other side of the plaza; they were screaming in unison at each other. "They make their decisions by endurance; the party that can resist the feelings of the other longest converts their opponents."  "Pure democracy," Gofredo declared. "Rule by the party that can make the most noise."  "And I'll bet that when they're sick, they go around chanting, 'I am well; I feel just fine!'" Anna said. "Autosuggestion would really work, here. Think of the feedback, too. One Svant has a feeling. He verbalizes it, and the sound of his own voice re-enforces it in him. It is induced in his hearers, and they verbalize it, re-enforcing it in themselves and in him. This could go on and on."  "Yes. It has. Look at their technology." He felt more comfortable, now he was on home ground again. "A friend of mine, speaking about a mutual acquaintance, once said, 'When they installed her circuits, they put in such big feeling circuits that there was no room left for any thinking circuits.' I think that's a perfect description of what I estimate Svant mentality to be. Take these bronze knives, and the musical instruments. Wonderful; the work of individuals trying to express feeling in metal or wood. But get an idea like the wheel, or even a pair of tongs? Poo! How would you state the First Law of Motion, or the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in tickle-pinch-rub terms? Sonny could grasp an idea like that. Sonny's handicap, if you call it that, cuts him off from feel-thinking; he can think logically instead of sensually."  He sipped his cocktail and continued: "I can understand why the village is mounded up, too. I realized that while I was watching Dave's gang bury the pump house. I'd been bothered by that, and by the absence of granaries for all the grain they raise, and by the number of people for so few and such small houses. I think the village is mostly underground, and the houses are just entrances, soundproofed, to shelter them from uncomfortable natural noises--thunderstorms, for instance."  The horn was braying in the snooper-screen speaker; somebody wondered what it was for. Gofredo laughed.  "I thought, at first, that it was a war-horn. It isn't. It's a peace-horn," he said. "Public tranquilizer. The first day, they brought it out and blew it at us to make us peaceable."  "Now I see why Sonny is rejected and persecuted," Anna was saying. "He must make all sorts of horrible noises that he can't hear ... that's not the word; we have none for it ... and nobody but his mother can stand being near him."  "Like me," Lillian said. "Now I understand. Just think of the most revolting thing that could be done to you physically; that's what I do to them every time I speak. And I always thought I had a nice voice," she added, pathetically.  "You have, for Terrans," Ayesha said. "For Svants, you'll just have to change it."  "But how--?"  "Use an analyzer; train it. That was why I took up sonics, in the first place. I had a voice like a crow with a sore throat, but by practicing with an analyzer, an hour a day, I gave myself an entirely different voice in a couple of months. Just try to get some pump-sound frequencies into it, like Luis'."  "But why? I'm no use here. I'm a linguist, and these people haven't any language that I could ever learn, and they couldn't even learn ours. They couldn't learn to make sounds, as sounds."  "You've been doing very good work with Mom on those ideographs," Meillard said. "Keep it up till you've taught her the Lingua Terra Basic vocabulary, and with her help we can train a few more. They can be our interpreters; we can write what we want them to say to the others. It'll be clumsy, but it will work, and it's about the only thing I can think of that will."  "And it will improve in time," Ayesha added. "And we can make vocoders and visibilizers. Paul, you have authority to requisition personnel from the ship's company. Draft me; I'll stay here and work on it."  The rumpus in the village plaza was getting worse. The Lord Mayor and his adherents were being out-shouted by the opposition.  "Better do something about that in a hurry, Paul, if you don't want a lot of Svants shot," Gofredo said. "Give that another half hour and we'll have visitors, with bows and spears."  "Ayesha, you have a recording of the pump," Meillard said. "Load a record-player onto a jeep and fly over the village and play it for them. Do it right away. Anna, get Mom in here. We want to get her to tell that gang that from now on, at noon and for a couple of hours after sunset, when the work's done, there will be free public pump-concerts, over the village plaza."         *       *       *       *       *  Ayesha and her warrant-officer helper and a Marine lieutenant went out hastily. Everybody else faced the screen to watch. In fifteen minutes, an airjeep was coming in on the village. As it circled low, a new sound, the steady _thugg-thugg, thugg-thugg_ of the pump, began.  The yelling and twittering and the blaring of the peace-horn died out almost at once. As the jeep circled down to housetop level, the two contending faction-clumps broke apart; their component individuals moved into the center of the plaza and squatted, staring up, letting the delicious waves of sound caress them.  "Do we have to send a detail in a jeep to do that twice a day?" Gofredo asked. "We keep a snooper over the village; fit it with a loud-speaker and a timer; it can give them their _thugg-thugg_, on schedule, automatically."  "We might give the Lord Mayor a recording and a player and let him decide when the people ought to listen--if that's the word--to it," Dorver said. "Then it would be something of their own."  "No!" He spoke so vehemently that the others started. "You know what would happen? Nobody would be able to turn it off; they'd all be hypnotized, or doped, or whatever it is. They'd just sit in a circle around it till they starved to death, and when the power-unit gave out, the record-player would be surrounded by a ring of skeletons. We'll just have to keep on playing it for them ourselves. Terrans' Burden."  "That'll give us a sanction over them," Gofredo observed. "Extra _thugg-thugg_ if they're very good; shut it off on them if they act nasty. And find out what Lillian has in her voice that the rest of us don't have, and make a good loud recording of that, and stash it away along with the rest of the heavy-weapons ammunition. You know, you're not going to have any trouble at all, when we go down-country to talk to the king or whatever. This is better than fire-water ever was."  "We must never misuse our advantage, Luis," Meillard said seriously. "We must use it only for their good."  He really meant it. Only--You had to know some general history to study technological history, and it seemed to him that that pious assertion had been made a few times before. Some of the others who had made it had really meant it, too, but that had made little difference in the long run.  Fayon and Anna were talking enthusiastically about the work ahead of them.  "I don't know where your subject ends and mine begins," Anna was saying. "We'll just have to handle it between us. What are we going to call it? We certainly can't call it hearing."  "Nonauditory sonic sense is the only thing I can think of," Fayon said. "And that's such a clumsy term."  "Mark; you thought of it first," Anna said. "What do you think?"  "Nonauditory sonic sense. It isn't any worse than Domesticated Type C, and that got cut down to size. _Naudsonce._" IN THE YEAR 2889  [Redactor's note: _In the Year 2889_ was first published in the _Forum_, February, 1889; p. 262. It was published in France the next year. Although published under the name of Jules Verne, it is now believed to be chiefly if not entirely the work of Jules' son, Michel Verne. In any event, many of the topics in the article echo Verne's ideas.]  IN THE YEAR 2889.  Little though they seem to think of it, the people of this twenty-ninth century live continually in fairyland. Surfeited as they are with marvels, they are indifferent in presence of each new marvel. To them all seems natural. Could they but duly appreciate the refinements of civilization in our day; could they but compare the present with the past, and so better comprehend the advance we have made! How much fairer they would find our modern towns, with populations amounting sometimes to 10,000,000 souls; their streets 300 feet wide, their houses 1000 feet in height; with a temperature the same in all seasons; with their lines of aerial locomotion crossing the sky in every direction! If they would but picture to themselves the state of things that once existed, when through muddy streets rumbling boxes on wheels, drawn by horses--yes, by horses!--were the only means of conveyance. Think of the railroads of the olden time, and you will be able to appreciate the pneumatic tubes through which to-day one travels at the rate of 1000 miles an hour. Would not our contemporaries prize the telephone and the telephote more highly if they had not forgotten the telegraph?  Singularly enough, all these transformations rest upon principles which were perfectly familiar to our remote ancestors, but which they disregarded. Heat, for instance, is as ancient as man himself; electricity was known 3000 years ago, and steam 1100 years ago. Nay, so early as ten centuries ago it was known that the differences between the several chemical and physical forces depend on the mode of vibration of the etheric particles, which is for each specifically different. When at last the kinship of all these forces was discovered, it is simply astounding that 500 years should still have to elapse before men could analyze and describe the several modes of vibration that constitute these differences. Above all, it is singular that the mode of reproducing these forces directly from one another, and of reproducing one without the others, should have remained undiscovered till less than a hundred years ago. Nevertheless, such was the course of events, for it was not till the year 2792 that the famous Oswald Nier made this great discovery.  Truly was he a great benefactor of the human race. His admirable discovery led to many another. Hence is sprung a pleiad of inventors, its brightest star being our great Joseph Jackson. To Jackson we are indebted for those wonderful instruments the new accumulators. Some of these absorb and condense the living force contained in the sun's rays; others, the electricity stored in our globe; others again, the energy coming from whatever source, as a waterfall, a stream, the winds, etc. He, too, it was that invented the transformer, a more wonderful contrivance still, which takes the living force from the accumulator, and, on the simple pressure of a button, gives it back to space in whatever form may be desired, whether as heat, light, electricity, or mechanical force, after having first obtained from it the work required. From the day when these two instruments were contrived is to be dated the era of true progress. They have put into the hands of man a power that is almost infinite. As for their applications, they are numberless. Mitigating the rigors of winter, by giving back to the atmosphere the surplus heat stored up during the summer, they have revolutionized agriculture. By supplying motive power for aerial navigation, they have given to commerce a mighty impetus. To them we are indebted for the continuous production of electricity without batteries or dynamos, of light without combustion or incandescence, and for an unfailing supply of mechanical energy for all the needs of industry.  Yes, all these wonders have been wrought by the accumulator and the transformer. And can we not to them also trace, indirectly, this latest wonder of all, the great "Earth Chronicle" building in 253d Avenue, which was dedicated the other day? If George Washington Smith, the founder of the Manhattan "Chronicle", should come back to life to-day, what would he think were he to be told that this palace of marble and gold belongs to his remote descendant, Fritz Napoleon Smith, who, after thirty generations have come and gone, is owner of the same newspaper which his ancestor established!  For George Washington Smith's newspaper has lived generation after generation, now passing out of the family, anon coming back to it. When, 200 years ago, the political center of the United States was transferred from Washington to Centropolis, the newspaper followed the government and assumed the name of Earth Chronicle. Unfortunately, it was unable to maintain itself at the high level of its name. Pressed on all sides by rival journals of a more modern type, it was continually in danger of collapse. Twenty years ago its subscription list contained but a few hundred thousand names, and then Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith bought it for a mere trifle, and originated telephonic journalism.  Every one is familiar with Fritz Napoleon Smith's system--a system made possible by the enormous development of telephony during the last hundred years. Instead of being printed, the Earth Chronicle is every morning spoken to subscribers, who, in interesting conversations with reporters, statesmen, and scientists, learn the news of the day. Furthermore, each subscriber owns a phonograph, and to this instrument he leaves the task of gathering the news whenever he happens not to be in a mood to listen directly himself. As for purchasers of single copies, they can at a very trifling cost learn all that is in the paper of the day at any of the innumerable phonographs set up nearly everywhere.  Fritz Napoleon Smith's innovation galvanized the old newspaper. In the course of a few years the number of subscribers grew to be 80,000,000, and Smith's wealth went on growing, till now it reaches the almost unimaginable figure of $10,000,000,000. This lucky hit has enabled him to erect his new building, a vast edifice with four _facades_ each 3,250 feet in length, over which proudly floats the hundred-starred flag of the Union. Thanks to the same lucky hit, he is to-day king of newspaperdom; indeed, he would be king of all the Americans, too, if Americans could ever accept a king. You do not believe it? Well, then, look at the plenipotentiaries of all nations and our own ministers themselves crowding about his door, entreating his counsels, begging for his approbation, imploring the aid of his all-powerful organ. Reckon up the number of scientists and artists that he supports, of inventors that he has under his pay.  Yes, a king is he. And in truth his is a royalty full of burdens. His labors are incessant, and there is no doubt at all that in earlier times any man would have succumbed under the overpowering stress of the toil which Mr. Smith has to perform. Very fortunately for him, thanks to the progress of hygiene, which, abating all the old sources of unhealthfulness, has lifted the mean of human life from 37 up to 52 years, men have stronger constitutions now than heretofore. The discovery of nutritive air is still in the future, but in the meantime men today consume food that is compounded and prepared according to scientific principles, and they breathe an atmosphere freed from the micro-organisms that formerly used to swarm in it; hence they live longer than their forefathers and know nothing of the innumerable diseases of olden times.  Nevertheless, and notwithstanding these considerations, Fritz Napoleon Smith's mode of life may well astonish one. His iron constitution is taxed to the utmost by the heavy strain that is put upon it. Vain the attempt to estimate the amount of labor he undergoes; an example alone can give an idea of it. Let us then go about with him for one day as he attends to his multifarious concernments. What day? That matters little; it is the same every day. Let us then take at random September 25th of this present year 2889.  This morning Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith awoke in very bad humor. His wife having left for France eight days ago, he was feeling disconsolate. Incredible though it seems, in all the ten years since their marriage, this is the first time that Mrs. Edith Smith, the professional beauty, has been so long absent from home; two or three days usually suffice for her frequent trips to Europe. The first thing that Mr. Smith does is to connect his phonotelephote, the wires of which communicate with his Paris mansion. The telephote! Here is another of the great triumphs of science in our time. The transmission of speech is an old story; the transmission of images by means of sensitive mirrors connected by wires is a thing but of yesterday. A valuable invention indeed, and Mr. Smith this morning was not niggard of blessings for the inventor, when by its aid he was able distinctly to see his wife notwithstanding the distance that separated him from her. Mrs. Smith, weary after the ball or the visit to the theater the preceding night, is still abed, though it is near noontide at Paris. She is asleep, her head sunk in the lace-covered pillows. What? She stirs? Her lips move. She is dreaming perhaps? Yes, dreaming. She is talking, pronouncing a name his name--Fritz! The delightful vision gave a happier turn to Mr. Smith's thoughts. And now, at the call of imperative duty, light-hearted he springs from his bed and enters his mechanical dresser.  Two minutes later the machine deposited him all dressed at the threshold of his office. The round of journalistic work was now begun. First he enters the hall of the novel-writers, a vast apartment crowned with an enormous transparent cupola. In one corner is a telephone, through which a hundred Earth Chronicle _litterateurs_ in turn recount to the public in daily installments a hundred novels. Addressing one of these authors who was waiting his turn, "Capital! Capital! my dear fellow," said he, "your last story. The scene where the village maid discusses interesting philosophical problems with her lover shows your very acute power of observation. Never have the ways of country folk been better portrayed. Keep on, my dear Archibald, keep on! Since yesterday, thanks to you, there is a gain of 5000 subscribers."  "Mr. John Last," he began again, turning to a new arrival, "I am not so well pleased with your work. Your story is not a picture of life; it lacks the elements of truth. And why? Simply because you run straight on to the end; because you do not analyze. Your heroes do this thing or that from this or that motive, which you assign without ever a thought of dissecting their mental and moral natures. Our feelings, you must remember, are far more complex than all that. In real life every act is the resultant of a hundred thoughts that come and go, and these you must study, each by itself, if you would create a living character. 'But,' you will say, 'in order to note these fleeting thoughts one must know them, must be able to follow them in their capricious meanderings.' Why, any child can do that, as you know. You have simply to make use of hypnotism, electrical or human, which gives one a two-fold being, setting free the witness-personality so that it may see, understand, and remember the reasons which determine the personality that acts. Just study yourself as you live from day to day, my dear Last. Imitate your associate whom I was complimenting a moment ago. Let yourself be hypnotized. What's that? You have tried it already? Not sufficiently, then, not sufficiently!"  Mr. Smith continues his round and enters the reporters' hall. Here 1500 reporters, in their respective places, facing an equal number of telephones, are communicating to the subscribers the news of the world as gathered during the night. The organization of this matchless service has often been described. Besides his telephone, each reporter, as the reader is aware, has in front of him a set of commutators, which enable him to communicate with any desired telephotic line. Thus the subscribers not only hear the news but see the occurrences. When an incident is described that is already past, photographs of its main features are transmitted with the narrative. And there is no confusion withal. The reporters' items, just like the different stories and all the other component parts of the journal, are classified automatically according to an ingenious system, and reach the hearer in due succession. Furthermore, the hearers are free to listen only to what specially concerns them. They may at pleasure give attention to one editor and refuse it to another.  Mr. Smith next addresses one of the ten reporters in the astronomical department--a department still in the embryonic stage, but which will yet play an important part in journalism.  "Well, Cash, what's the news?"  "We have phototelegrams from Mercury, Venus, and Mars."  "Are those from Mars of any interest?"  "Yes, indeed. There is a revolution in the Central Empire."  "And what of Jupiter?" asked Mr. Smith.  "Nothing as yet. We cannot quite understand their signals. Perhaps ours do not reach them."  "That's bad," exclaimed Mr. Smith, as he hurried away, not in the best of humor, toward the hall of the scientific editors.  With their heads bent down over their electric computers, thirty scientific men were absorbed in transcendental calculations. The coming of Mr. Smith was like the falling of a bomb among them.  "Well, gentlemen, what is this I hear? No answer from Jupiter? Is it always to be thus? Come, Cooley, you have been at work now twenty years on this problem, and yet--"  "True enough," replied the man addressed. "Our science of optics is still very defective, and though our mile-and-three-quarter telescopes."  "Listen to that, Peer," broke in Mr. Smith, turning to a second scientist. "Optical science defective! Optical science is your specialty. But," he continued, again addressing William Cooley, "failing with Jupiter, are we getting any results from the moon?"  "The case is no better there."  "This time you do not lay the blame on the science of optics. The moon is immeasurably less distant than Mars, yet with Mars our communication is fully established. I presume you will not say that you lack telescopes?"  "Telescopes? O no, the trouble here is about inhabitants!"  "That's it," added Peer.  "So, then, the moon is positively uninhabited?" asked Mr. Smith.  "At least," answered Cooley, "on the face which she presents to us. As for the opposite side, who knows?"  "Ah, the opposite side! You think, then," remarked Mr. Smith, musingly, "that if one could but--"  "Could what?"  "Why, turn the moon about-face."  "Ah, there's something in that," cried the two men at once. And indeed, so confident was their air, they seemed to have no doubt as to the possibility of success in such an undertaking.  "Meanwhile," asked Mr. Smith, after a moment's silence, "have you no news of interest to-day?"  "Indeed we have," answered Cooley. "The elements of Olympus are definitively settled. That great planet gravitates beyond Neptune at the mean distance of 11,400,799,642 miles from the sun, and to traverse its vast orbit takes 1311 years, 294 days, 12 hours, 43 minutes, 9 seconds."  "Why didn't you tell me that sooner?" cried Mr. Smith. "Now inform the reporters of this straightaway. You know how eager is the curiosity of the public with regard to these astronomical questions. That news must go into to-day's issue."  Then, the two men bowing to him, Mr. Smith passed into the next hall, an enormous gallery upward of 3200 feet in length, devoted to atmospheric advertising. Every one has noticed those enormous advertisements reflected from the clouds, so large that they may be seen by the populations of whole cities or even of entire countries. This, too, is one of Mr. Fritz Napoleon Smith's ideas, and in the Earth Chronicle building a thousand projectors are constantly engaged in displaying upon the clouds these mammoth advertisements.  When Mr. Smith to-day entered the sky-advertising department, he found the operators sitting with folded arms at their motionless projectors, and inquired as to the cause of their inaction. In response, the man addressed simply pointed to the sky, which was of a pure blue. "Yes," muttered Mr. Smith, "a cloudless sky! That's too bad, but what's to be done? Shall we produce rain? That we might do, but is it of any use? What we need is clouds, not rain. Go," said he, addressing the head engineer, "go see Mr. Samuel Mark, of the meteorological division of the scientific department, and tell him for me to go to work in earnest on the question of artificial clouds. It will never do for us to be always thus at the mercy of cloudless skies!"  Mr. Smith's daily tour through the several departments of his newspaper is now finished. Next, from the advertisement hall he passes to the reception chamber, where the ambassadors accredited to the American government are awaiting him, desirous of having a word of counsel or advice from the all-powerful editor. A discussion was going on when he entered. "Your Excellency will pardon me," the French Ambassador was saying to the Russian, "but I see nothing in the map of Europe that requires change. 'The North for the Slavs?' Why, yes, of course; but the South for the Matins. Our common frontier, the Rhine, it seems to me, serves very well. Besides, my government, as you must know, will firmly oppose every movement, not only against Paris, our capital, or our two great prefectures, Rome and Madrid, but also against the kingdom of Jerusalem, the dominion of Saint Peter, of which France means to be the trusty defender."  "Well said!" exclaimed Mr. Smith. "How is it," he asked, turning to the Russian ambassador, "that you Russians are not content with your vast empire, the most extensive in the world, stretching from the banks of the Rhine to the Celestial Mountains and the Kara-Korum, whose shores are washed by the Frozen Ocean, the Atlantic, the Mediterranean, and the Indian Ocean? Then, what is the use of threats? Is war possible in view of modern inventions-asphyxiating shells capable of being projected a distance of 60 miles, an electric spark of 90 miles, that can at one stroke annihilate a battalion; to say nothing of the plague, the cholera, the yellow fever, that the belligerents might spread among their antagonists mutually, and which would in a few days destroy the greatest armies?"  "True," answered the Russian; "but can we do all that we wish? As for us Russians, pressed on our eastern frontier by the Chinese, we must at any cost put forth our strength for an effort toward the west."  "O, is that all? In that case," said Mr. Smith, "the thing can be arranged. I will speak to the Secretary of State about it. The attention of the Chinese government shall be called to the matter. This is not the first time that the Chinese have bothered us."  "Under these conditions, of course--" And the Russian ambassador declared himself satisfied.  "Ah, Sir John, what can I do for you?" asked Mr. Smith as he turned to the representative of the people of Great Britain, who till now had remained silent.  "A great deal," was the reply. "If the Earth Chronicle would but open a campaign on our behalf--"  "And for what object?"  "Simply for the annulment of the Act of Congress annexing to the United States the British islands."  Though, by a just turn-about of things here below, Great Britain has become a colony of the United States, the English are not yet reconciled to the situation. At regular intervals they are ever addressing to the American government vain complaints.  "A campaign against the annexation that has been an accomplished fact for 150 years!" exclaimed Mr. Smith. "How can your people suppose that I would do anything so unpatriotic?"  "We at home think that your people must now be sated. The Monroe doctrine is fully applied; the whole of America belongs to the Americans. What more do you want? Besides, we will pay for what we ask."  "Indeed!" answered Mr. Smith, without manifesting the slightest irritation. "Well, you English will ever be the same. No, no, Sir John, do not count on me for help. Give up our fairest province, Britain? Why not ask France generously to renounce possession of Africa, that magnificent colony the complete conquest of which cost her the labor of 800 years? You will be well received!"  "You decline! All is over then!" murmured the British agent sadly. "The United Kingdom falls to the share of the Americans; the Indies to that of--"  "The Russians," said Mr. Smith, completing the sentence.  "Australia--"  "Has an independent government."  "Then nothing at all remains for us!" sighed Sir John, downcast.  "Nothing?" asked Mr. Smith, laughing. "Well, now, there's Gibraltar!"  With this sally, the audience ended. The clock was striking twelve, the hour of breakfast. Mr. Smith returns to his chamber. Where the bed stood in the morning a table all spread comes up through the floor. For Mr. Smith, being above all a practical man; has reduced the problem of existence to its simplest terms. For him, instead of the endless suites of apartments of the olden time, one room fitted with ingenious mechanical contrivances is enough. Here he sleeps, takes his meals, in short, lives.  He seats himself. In the mirror of the phonotelephote is seen the same chamber at Paris which appeared in it this morning. A table furnished forth is likewise in readiness here, for notwithstanding the difference of hours, Mr. Smith and his wife have arranged to take their meals simultaneously. It is delightful thus to take breakfast _tete-a-tete_ with one who is 3000 miles or so away. Just now, Mrs. Smith's chamber has no occupant.  "She is late! Woman's punctuality! Progress everywhere except there!" muttered Mr. Smith as he turned the tap for the first dish. For like all wealthy folk in our day, Mr. Smith has done away with the domestic kitchen and is a subscriber to the Grand Alimentation Company, which sends through a great network of tubes to subscribers' residences all sorts of dishes, as a varied assortment is always in readiness. A subscription costs money, to be sure, but the _cuisine_ is of the best, and the system has this advantage, that it, does away with the pestering race of the _cordons-bleus_. Mr. Smith received and ate, all alone, the _hors-d'oeuvre, entrees, roti_ and _legumes_ that constituted the repast. He was just finishing the dessert when Mrs. Smith appeared in the mirror of the telephote.  "Why, where have you been?" asked Mr. Smith through the telephone.  "What! You are already at the dessert? Then I am late," she exclaimed, with a winsome _naivete_. "Where have I been, you ask? Why, at my dress-maker's. The hats are just lovely this season! I suppose I forgot to note the time, and so am a little late."  "Yes, a little," growled Mr. Smith; "so little that I have already quite finished breakfast. Excuse me if I leave you now, but I must be going."  "O certainly, my dear; good-by till evening."  Smith stepped into his air-coach, which was in waiting for him at a window. "Where do you wish to go, sir?" inquired the coachman.  "Let me see; I have three hours," Mr. Smith mused. "Jack, take me to my accumulator works at Niagara."  For Mr. Smith has obtained a lease of the great falls of Niagara. For ages the energy developed by the falls went unutilized. Smith, applying Jackson's invention, now collects this energy, and lets or sells it. His visit to the works took more time than he had anticipated. It was four o'clock when he returned home, just in time for the daily audience which he grants to callers.  One readily understands how a man situated as Smith is must be beset with requests of all kinds. Now it is an inventor needing capital; again it is some visionary who comes to advocate a brilliant scheme which must surely yield millions of profit. A choice has to be made between these projects, rejecting the worthless, examining the questionable ones, accepting the meritorious. To this work Mr. Smith devotes every day two full hours.  The callers were fewer to-day than usual--only twelve of them. Of these, eight had only impracticable schemes to propose. In fact, one of them wanted to revive painting, an art fallen into desuetude owing to the progress made in color-photography. Another, a physician, boasted that he had discovered a cure for nasal catarrh! These impracticables were dismissed in short order. Of the four projects favorably received, the first was that of a young man whose broad forehead betokened his intellectual power.  "Sir, I am a chemist," he began, "and as such I come to you."  "Well!"  "Once the elementary bodies," said the young chemist, "were held to be sixty-two in number; a hundred years ago they were reduced to ten; now only three remain irresolvable, as you are aware."  "Yes, yes."  "Well, sir, these also I will show to be composite. In a few months, a few weeks, I shall have succeeded in solving the problem. Indeed, it may take only a few days."  "And then?"  "Then, sir, I shall simply have determined the absolute. All I want is money enough to carry my research to a successful issue."  "Very well," said Mr. Smith. "And what will be the practical outcome of your discovery?"  "The practical outcome? Why, that we shall be able to produce easily all bodies whatever--stone, wood, metal, fibers--"  "And flesh and blood?" queried Mr. Smith, interrupting him. "Do you pretend that you expect to manufacture a human being out and out?"  "Why not?"  Mr. Smith advanced $100,000 to the young chemist, and engaged his services for the Earth Chronicle laboratory.  The second of the four successful applicants, starting from experiments made so long ago as the nineteenth century and again and again repeated, had conceived the idea of removing an entire city all at once from one place to another. His special project had to do with the city of Granton, situated, as everybody knows, some fifteen miles inland. He proposes to transport the city on rails and to change it into a watering-place. The profit, of course, would be enormous. Mr. Smith, captivated by the scheme, bought a half-interest in it.  "As you are aware, sir," began applicant No. 3, "by the aid of our solar and terrestrial accumulators and transformers, we are able to make all the seasons the same. I propose to do something better still. Transform into heat a portion of the surplus energy at our disposal; send this heat to the poles; then the polar regions, relieved of their snow-cap, will become a vast territory available for man's use. What think you of the scheme?"  "Leave your plans with me, and come back in a week. I will have them examined in the meantime."  Finally, the fourth announced the early solution of a weighty scientific problem. Every one will remember the bold experiment made a hundred years ago by Dr. Nathaniel Faithburn. The doctor, being a firm believer in human hibernation--in other words, in the possibility of our suspending our vital functions and of calling them into action again after a time--resolved to subject the theory to a practical test. To this end, having first made his last will and pointed out the proper method of awakening him; having also directed that his sleep was to continue a hundred years to a day from the date of his apparent death, he unhesitatingly put the theory to the proof in his own person.  Reduced to the condition of a mummy, Dr. Faithburn was coffined and laid in a tomb. Time went on. September 25th, 2889, being the day set for his resurrection, it was proposed to Mr. Smith that he should permit the second part of the experiment to be performed at his residence this evening.  "Agreed. Be here at ten o'clock," answered Mr. Smith; and with that the day's audience was closed.  Left to himself, feeling tired, he lay down on an extension chair. Then, touching a knob, he established communication with the Central Concert Hall, whence our greatest _maestros_ send out to subscribers their delightful successions of accords determined by recondite algebraic formulas. Night was approaching. Entranced by the harmony, forgetful of the hour, Smith did not notice that it was growing dark. It was quite dark when he was aroused by the sound of a door opening. "Who is there?" he asked, touching a commutator.  Suddenly, in consequence of the vibrations produced, the air became luminous.  "Ah! you, Doctor?"  "Yes," was the reply. "How are you?"  "I am feeling well."  "Good! Let me see your tongue. All right! Your pulse. Regular! And your appetite?"  "Only passably good."  "Yes, the stomach. There's the rub. You are over-worked. If your stomach is out of repair, it must be mended. That requires study. We must think about it."  "In the meantime," said Mr. Smith, "you will dine with me."  As in the morning, the table rose out of the floor. Again, as in the morning, the _potage, roti, ragouts_, and _legumes_ were supplied through the food-pipes. Toward the close of the meal, phonotelephotic communication was made with Paris. Smith saw his wife, seated alone at the dinner-table, looking anything but pleased at her loneliness.  "Pardon me, my dear, for having left you alone," he said through the telephone. "I was with Dr. Wilkins."  "Ah, the good doctor!" remarked Mrs. Smith, her countenance lighting up.  "Yes. But, pray, when are you coming home?"  "This evening."  "Very well. Do you come by tube or by air-train?"  "Oh, by tube."  "Yes; and at what hour will you arrive?"  "About eleven, I suppose."  "Eleven by Centropolis time, you mean?"  "Yes."  "Good-by, then, for a little while," said Mr. Smith as he severed communication with Paris.  Dinner over, Dr. Wilkins wished to depart. "I shall expect you at ten," said Mr Smith. "To-day, it seems, is the day for the return to life of the famous Dr. Faithburn. You did not think of it, I suppose. The awakening is to take place here in my house. You must come and see. I shall depend on your being here."  "I will come back," answered Dr. Wilkins.  Left alone, Mr. Smith busied himself with examining his accounts--a task of vast magnitude, having to do with transactions which involve a daily expenditure of upward of $800,000. Fortunately, indeed, the stupendous progress of mechanic art in modern times makes it comparatively easy. Thanks to the Piano Electro-Reckoner, the most complex calculations can be made in a few seconds. In two hours Mr. Smith completed his task. Just in time. Scarcely had he turned over the last page when Dr. Wilkins arrived. After him came the body of Dr. Faithburn, escorted by a numerous company of men of science. They commenced work at once. The casket being laid down in the middle of the room, the telephote was got in readiness. The outer world, already notified, was anxiously expectant, for the whole world could be eye-witnesses of the performance, a reporter meanwhile, like the chorus in the ancient drama, explaining it all _viva voce_ through the telephone.  "They are opening the casket," he explained. "Now they are taking Faithburn out of it--a veritable mummy, yellow, hard, and dry. Strike the body and it resounds like a block of wood. They are now applying heat; now electricity. No result. These experiments are suspended for a moment while Dr. Wilkins makes an examination of the body. Dr. Wilkins, rising, declares the man to be dead. 'Dead!' exclaims every one present. 'Yes,' answers Dr. Wilkins, 'dead!' 'And how long has he been dead?' Dr. Wilkins makes another examination. 'A hundred years,' he replies."  The case stood just as the reporter said. Faithburn was dead, quite certainly dead! "Here is a method that needs improvement," remarked Mr. Smith to Dr. Wilkins, as the scientific committee on hibernation bore the casket out. "So much for that experiment. But if poor Faithburn is dead, at least he is sleeping," he continued. "I wish I could get some sleep. I am tired out, Doctor, quite tired out! Do you not think that a bath would refresh me?"  "Certainly. But you must wrap yourself up well before you go out into the hall-way. You must not expose yourself to cold."  "Hall-way? Why, Doctor, as you well know, everything is done by machinery here. It is not for me to go to the bath; the bath will come to me. Just look!" and he pressed a button. After a few seconds a faint rumbling was heard, which grew louder and louder. Suddenly the door opened, and the tub appeared.  Such, for this year of grace 2889, is the history of one day in the life of the editor of the Earth Chronicle. And the history of that one day is the history of 365 days every year, except leap-years, and then of 366 days--for as yet no means has been found of increasing the length of the terrestrial year. DANGER IN DEEP SPACE     CHAPTER 1   "Stand by to reduce thrust on main drive rockets!" The tall, broad-shouldered officer in the uniform of the Solar Guard snapped out the order as he watched the telescanner screen and saw the Western Hemisphere of Earth looming larger and larger.  "Aye, aye, Captain Strong," replied a handsome curly-haired Space Cadet. He turned to the ship's intercom and spoke quickly into the microphone.  "Control deck to power deck. Check in!"  "Power deck, aye," a bull-throated voice bellowed over the loud-speaker.  "Stand by rockets, Astro! We're coming in for a landing."  "Standing by!"  The Solar Guard officer turned away from the telescanner and glanced quickly over the illuminated banks of indicators on the control panel. "Is our orbit to Space Academy clear?" he asked the cadet. "Have we been assigned a landing ramp?"  "I'll check topside, sir," answered the cadet, turning back to the intercom. "Control deck to radar deck. Check in!"  "Radar bridge, aye," drawled a lazy voice over the speaker.  "Are we cleared for landing, Roger?"  "Everything clear as glass ahead, Tom," was the calm reply.  "We're steady on orbit and we touch down on ramp seven. Then"--the voice began to quicken with excitement--"three weeks' liberty coming up!"  The rumbling voice of the power-deck cadet suddenly broke in over the intercom. "Lay off that space gas, Manning. Just see that this space wagon gets on the ground in one piece. Then you can dream about your leave!"  "Plug your jets, you big Venusian ape man," was the reply, "or I'll turn you inside out!"  "Yeah? You and what fleet of spaceships?"  "Just me, buster, with my bare hands!"  The Solar Guard officer on the control deck smiled at the young cadet beside him as the good-natured argument crackled over the intercom speaker overhead. "Looks like those two will never stop battling, Corbett," he commented dryly.  "Guess they'll never learn, sir," sighed the cadet.  "That's all right. It's when they stop battling that I'll start getting worried," answered the officer. He turned back to the controls. "One hundred thousand feet from Earth's surface! Begin landing procedure!"  As Cadet Tom Corbett snapped orders into the intercom and his unit-mates responded by smooth co-ordinated action, the giant rocket cruiser _Polaris_ slowly arched through Earth's atmosphere, first nosing up to lose speed and then settling tailfirst toward its destination--the spaceport at Space Academy, U.S.A.  Far below, on the grounds of the Academy, cadets wearing the green uniforms of first-year Earthworms and the blue of the upper-classmen stopped all activity as they heard the blasting of the braking rockets high in the heavens. They stared enviously into the sky, watching the smooth steel-hulled spaceship drop toward the concrete ramp area of the spaceport, three miles away.  [Illustration: SPACE ACADEMY U.S.A.]  In his office at the top of the gleaming Tower of Galileo, Commander Walters, commandant of Space Academy, paused for a moment from his duties and turned from his desk to watch the touchdown of the great spaceship. And on the grassy quadrangle, Warrant Officer Mike McKenny, short and stubby in his scarlet uniform of the enlisted Solar Guard, stopped his frustrating task of drilling newly arrived cadets to watch the mighty ship come to Earth.  Young and old, the feeling of belonging to the great fleet that patrolled the space lanes across the millions of miles of the solar system was something that never died in a true spaceman. The green-clad cadets dreamed of the future when they would feel the bucking rockets in their backs. And the older men smiled faintly as memories of their own first space flight came to mind.  Aboard the _Polaris_, the young cadet crew worked swiftly and smoothly to bring their ship to a safe landing. There was Tom Corbett, an average young man in this age of science, who had been selected as the control-deck and command cadet of the _Polaris_ unit after rigid examinations and tests. Topside, on the radar bridge, was Roger Manning, cocky and brash, but a specialist in radar and communications. Below, on the power deck, was Astro, a colonial from Venus, who had been accused of cutting his teeth on an atomic rocket motor, so great was his skill with the mighty "thrust buckets," as he lovingly called the atomic rockets.  Now, returning from a routine training flight that had taken them to the moons of Jupiter, the three cadets, Corbett, Manning, and Astro, and their unit skipper, Captain Steve Strong, completed the delicate task of setting the great ship down on the Academy spaceport.  "Closing in fast, sir," announced Tom, his attention focused on the meters and dials in front of him. "Five hundred feet to touchdown."  "Full braking thrust!" snapped Strong crisply.  Deep inside the _Polaris_, braking rockets roared with unceasing power, and the mighty spaceship eased itself to the concrete surface of the Academy spaceport.  "Touchdown!" yelled Tom. He quickly closed the master control lever, cutting all power, and sudden silence filled the ship. He stood up and faced Strong, saluting smartly.  "Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ completes mission"--he glanced at the astral chronometer on the panel board--"at fifteen thirty-three, sir."  "Very well, Corbett," replied Strong, returning the salute. "Check the _Polaris_ from radar mast to exhaust ports right away."  "Yes, sir," was Tom's automatic answer, and then he caught himself. "But I thought--"  Strong interrupted him with a wave of his hand. "I know, Corbett, you thought the _Polaris_ would be pulled in for a general overhaul and you three would get liberty."  "Yes, sir," replied Tom.  "I'm not sure you won't get it," said Strong, "but I received a message last night from Commander Walters. I think the _Polaris_ unit might have another assignment coming up!"  "By the rings of Saturn," drawled Roger from the open hatch to the radar bridge, "you might know the old man would have another mission for us! We haven't had a liberty since we were Earthworms!"  "I'm sorry, Manning," said Strong, "but you know if I had my way, you'd certainly get the liberty. If anyone deserves it, you three do."  By this time Astro had joined the group on the control deck.  "But, sir," ventured Tom, "we've all made plans, I mean--well, my folks are expecting me."  "_Us_, you mean," interrupted Roger. "Astro and I are your guests, remember?"  "Sure, I remember," said Tom, smiling. He turned back to Captain Strong. "We'd appreciate it if you could do something for us, sir. I mean--well, have another unit assigned."  Strong stepped forward and put his arms around the shoulders of Tom and Roger and faced Astro. "I'm afraid you three made a big mistake in becoming the best unit in the Academy. Now every time there's an important assignment to be handed out the name of the _Polaris_ unit sticks out like a hot rocket!"  "Some consolation," said Roger dourly.  Strong smiled. "All right, check this wagon and then report to me in my quarters in the morning. You'll have tonight off at least. Unit _dis_-missed!"  The three cadets snapped their backs straight, stood rigid, and saluted as their superior officer strode toward the hatch. His foot on the ladder, he turned and faced them again.  "It's been a fine mission. I want to compliment you on the way you've handled yourselves these past few months. You boys are real spacemen!" He saluted and disappeared down the ladder leading to the exit port.  "And that," said Roger, turning to his unit-mates, "is known as the royal come-on for a dirty detail!"  "Ahhh, stop your gassing, Manning," growled Astro. "Just be sure your radar bridge is O.K. If we do have to blast out of here in a hurry, I want to get where we're supposed to be going!"  "You just worry about the power deck, spaceboy, and let little Roger take care of his own department," replied Roger.  Astro eyed him speculatively. "You know the only reason they allowed this space creep in the Academy, Tom?" asked Astro.  "No, why?" asked Tom, playing along with the game.  "Because they knew any time the _Polaris_ ran out of reactant fuel we could just stick Manning in the rocket tubes and have him blow out some of his special brand of space gas!"  "Listen, you Venusian throwback! One more word out of you and--"  "All right, you two!" broke in Tom good-naturedly. "Enough's enough! Come on. We've got just enough time to run up to the mess hall and grab a good meal before we check the ship."  "That's for me," said Astro. "I've been eating those concentrates so long my stomach thinks I've turned into a test tube."  Astro referred to the food taken along on space missions. It was dehydrated and packed in plastic containers to save weight and space. The concentrates never made a satisfactory meal, even though they supplied everything necessary for a healthful diet.  A few moments later the three members of the _Polaris_ stood on the main slidewalk, an endless belt of plastic, powered by giant subsurface rollers, being carried from the spaceport to the main academy administration building, the great gleaming Tower of Galileo.  Space Academy, the university of the planets, was set among the low hills of the western part of the North American continent. Here, in the nest of fledgling spacemen, boys from Earth and the colonies of Venus and Mars learned the complex science that would enable them to reach unlimited heights; to rocket through the endless void of space and visit new worlds on distant planets millions of miles from Earth.  This was the year 2353--the age of space! A time when boys dreamed only of becoming Space Cadets at Space Academy, to learn their trade and later enter the mighty Solar Guard, or join the rapidly expanding merchant space service that sent out great fleets of rocket ships daily to every corner of the solar system.  As the slidewalk carried the three cadets between the buildings that surrounded the grassy quadrangle of the Academy, Tom looked up at the Tower of Galileo dominating the entire area.  "You know," he began haltingly, "every time I go near this place I get a lump in my throat!"  "Yeah," breathed Astro, "me too."  Roger made no comment. His eyes were following the path of the giant telescope reflector that moved in a slow arc, getting into position for the coming night's observations. Tom followed his gaze to the massive domed building, housing the giant one-thousand-inch reflector.  "You think we'll ever go as far into the deep with a rocket ship as we can see with the big eye?" he asked.  "I dunno," replied Roger. "That thing can penetrate other star systems in our galaxy. And that's a long way off!"  "Nearest thing to us is Alpha Centauri in our own galaxy, and that's twenty-three and a half million million miles away," commented Astro.  "That's not so far," argued Tom. "Only a few months ago the Solar Alliance sent out a scientific exploration to take a look at that baby."  "Musta been some hop," commented Roger.  "Hey!" cried Tom suddenly. "There's Alfie Higgins!" He pointed in the direction of another slidewalk moving at right angles to their own. The cadet that he singled out on the slidewalk was so thin and small he looked emaciated. He wore glasses and at the moment was absorbed in a paper he held in his hand.  "Well, what do you know!" cried Astro. "The Brain!"  Roger punched Astro in the mid-section. "If you were as smart as he is, you big grease monkey, you'd be O.K."  "Nah!" replied Astro. "If I was as smart as Alfie, I'd be scared. And besides, what do I need to be smart for? I've got you, haven't I?"  When they drew near the other slidewalk, the three members of the _Polaris_ unit skipped lightly over and jostled their way past other riders to the slightly built cadet.  "Alfie!" Tom yelled and slapped the cadet on the back. Alfie turned, his glasses knocked askew by Tom's blow, and eyed the three _Polaris_ members calmly.  "It gives me great pleasure to view your countenances again, Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro," he said solemnly, nodding to each one.  Astro twisted his face into a grimace. "What'd he say, Roger?"  "He's happy to see you," Roger translated.  "Well, in that case," beamed Astro, "I'm happy to see you too, Alfie!"  "What's the latest space dope around the Academy, Alfie?" asked Tom. "What's this?" he indicated the paper in Alfie's hand.  "By the sheerest of coincidences I happen to have a copy of your new assignment!" replied Alfie.  Tom, Roger, and Astro looked at each other in surprise.  "Well, come on, spaceman," urged Roger. "Give us the inside info. Where are we going?"  Alfie tucked the paper in his inside pocket and faced Roger. He cleared his throat and spoke in measured tones. "Manning, I have high regard for your personality, your capabilities, and your knowledge, all of which makes you an outstanding cadet. But even you know that I occupy a position of trust as cadet courier for Commander Walters and the administrative staff. I am not at liberty to mention anything that I would have occasion to observe while in the presence of Commander Walters or the staff. Therefore, you will please refrain from questioning me any further regarding the contents of these papers!"  Roger's jaw dropped. "Why, you human calculator, you were the one who brought it up in the first place! I oughta knock off that big head of yours!"  Tom and Astro laughed.  "Lay off, Roger," said Tom. "You ought to know Alfie couldn't talk if he wanted to! We'll just have to wait until Captain Strong is ready to tell us what our next assignment will be!"  By this time the slidewalk had carried them to the front of the main dormitory, and the wide doors were crowded with members of the Space Academy Corps heading in for the evening meal. From all corners of the quadrangle, the slidewalks carried Earthworms in their green uniforms, upper-class cadets in deep blue, enlisted spacemen in scarlet red, and Solar Guard officers in their striking uniforms of black and gold. Chatting and laughing, they all were entering the great building.  The _Polaris_ unit was well known among other cadet units, and they were greeted heartily from all sides. As Astro and Roger joked with various cadet units, forming up in front of the slidestairs leading down to the mess halls, Alfie turned to take a slidestairs going up. Suddenly he stopped, grabbed Tom by the shoulders, and whispered in his ear. Just as abruptly he turned and raced up the ascending slidestairs.  "What was that about?" asked Roger, as Tom stood staring after the little cadet.  "Roger--he--he said our next assignment would be one of the great experiments in space history. Something to be done that--that hasn't ever been done before!"  "Well, blast my jets!" said Astro. "What do you suppose it is?"  "Ahhh," sneered Roger, "I'll bet it's nothing more than taking some guinea pigs to see how they react to Jovian gravity. That's never been done before either! Why can't we get something exciting for a change?"  Tom laughed. "Come on, you bloodthirsty adventurer, I'm starved!"  But Tom knew that Alfie Higgins didn't get excited easily, and his eyes were wide and his voice trembled when he had whispered his secret to Tom.  The _Polaris_ unit was due to embark on a great new adventure!  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 2   "All O.K. here on the relay circuit," yelled Astro through the intercom from the power deck.  "O.K.," answered Tom. "Now try out the automatic blowers for the main tubes!"  "Wanta give me a little juice for the radar antenna, Astro?" called Roger from the radar deck.  "In a minute, Manning, in a minute," growled Astro. "Only got two hands, you know."  "You should learn to use your feet," quipped Roger. "Any normal Venusian can do just as much with his toes as he can with his fingers!"  Back and forth the bantering had gone for twelve hours, while the three members of the _Polaris_ unit tested, checked, adjusted, and rechecked the many different circuits, relays, junction boxes, and terminals in the miles of delicate wiring woven through the ship. Now, as dawn began to creep pink and gray over the eastern horizon, they made their last-minute search through the cavernous spaceship for any doubtful connections. Satisfied there were none, the three weary cadets assembled on the control deck and sipped the hot tea that Manning had thoughtfully prepared.  [Illustration: _The three weary cadets assembled on the control deck_]  "You know, by the time we get out of the Academy I don't think there'll be a single _inch_ of this space wagon that I haven't inspected with my nose," commented Roger in a tired voice.  "You know you love it, Manning," said Astro, who, though as tired as Tom and Roger, could still continue to work if necessary. His love for the mighty atomic rocket motors, and his ability to repair anything mechanical, was already a legend around the Academy. He cared for the power deck of the _Polaris_ as if it were a baby.  "Might as well pack in and grab some sleep before we report to Captain Strong," said Tom. "He might have us blasting off right away, and I, for one, would like to sleep and sleep and then sleep some more!"  "I've been thinking about what Alfie had to say," said Roger. "You know, about this being a great adventure."  "What about it?" asked Astro.  "Well, you don't give this kind of overhaul for just a plain, short hop upstairs."  "You think it might be something deeper?" asked Astro softly.  "Whatever it is," said Tom, getting up, "we'll need sleep." He rose, stretched, and walked wearily to the exit port. Astro and Roger followed him out, and once again they boarded the slidewalk for the trip back to the main dormitory and their quarters on the forty-second floor. A half hour later the three members of the _Polaris_ were sound asleep.   Early morning found Captain Steve Strong in his quarters, standing at the window and staring blankly out over the quadrangle. In his left hand he clutched a sheaf of papers. He had just reread, for the fifth time, a petition for reinstatement of space papers for Al Mason and Bill Loring. It wasn't easy, as Strong well knew, to deprive a man of his right to blast off and rocket through space, and the papers in question, issued only by the Solar Guard, comprised the only legal license to blast off.  Originally issued as a means of preventing overzealous Earthmen from blasting off without the proper training or necessary physical condition, which resulted in many deaths, space papers had gradually become the only effective means of controlling the vast expanding force of men who made space flight their life's work. With the establishment of the Spaceman's Code a hundred years before, firm rules and regulations for space flight had been instituted. Disobedience to any part of the code was punishable by suspension of papers and forfeiture of the right to blast off.  One of these rules stated that a spaceman was forbidden to blast off without authorization or clearance for a free orbit from a central traffic control. Bill Loring and Al Mason were guilty of having broken the regulation. Members of the crew of the recent expedition to Tara, a planet in orbit around the sun star Alpha Centauri, they had taken a rocket scout and blasted off without permission from Major Connel, the commander of the mission, who, in this case, was authorized traffic-control officer. Connel had recommended immediate suspension of their space papers. Mason and Loring had petitioned for a review, and, to assure impartial judgment, Commander Walters had sent the petition to one of his other officers to make a decision. The petition had landed on Strong's desk.  Strong read the petition again and shook his head. The facts were too clear. There had been flagrant disregard for the rules and there was no evidence to support the suspended spacemen's charge that they had been unjustly accused by Connel. Strong's duty was clear. He had to uphold Major Connel's action and suspend the men for a year.  Once the decision was made, Strong put the problem out of his mind. He walked to his huge circular desk and began sorting through the day's orders and reports. On the top of the pile of papers was a sealed envelope, bordered in red and marked "classified." It was from Commander Walters' office. Thoughtfully he opened it and read:       To: CAPTAIN STEVE STRONG: Cadet Supervisor,      _Polaris_ Unit      Upon receipt of this communication, you are ordered to      transfer the supervisory authority of the cadet unit      designated as _POLARIS_ unit; i.e., Cadets Tom Corbett, Roger      Manning, and Astro, and the command of the rocket cruiser      _Polaris_, to the command and supervisory authority of Major      Connel for execution of mission as outlined herein:       1. To test range, life, and general performance of audio      communications transmitter, type X21.       2. To test the above-mentioned transmitter under conditions of      deep space flight.       3. This test to take place on the planet Tara, Alpha Centauri.       This communication and all subsequent information relative to      above-mentioned mission shall be classified as _topmost      secret_.             Signed: WALTERS,                     _Commandant_, Space Academy  "So that's it," he thought. "A hop into deep space for the _Polaris_ unit!" He smiled. "The cadets of the _Polaris_ unit are in for a little surprise in two ways," he thought. "One from the mission and one from Major Connel!"  He almost laughed out loud as he turned to the small desk teleceiver at his elbow. He pressed a button immediately below the screen and it glowed into life to reveal a young man in the uniform of the enlisted guard.  "Yes, Captain Strong?" he asked.  "Call the cadets of the _Polaris_ unit," Strong ordered. "Have them report to me here on the double!"  "Aye, aye, sir."  Strong started to turn the set off, but the enlisted man added, "By the way, sir, Al Mason and Bill Loring are here to see you."  "Oh--well--" Strong hesitated.  "They're quite anxious to know if you've reached any decision regarding their petition for reinstatement."  "Mmm--yes, of course. Very well, send them in."  "Aye, aye, sir."  The teleceiver screen blackened. In a moment the door opposite Strong's desk slid back, and Loring and Mason stepped into the office. They shambled forward and stopped in front of the huge desk, obviously ill at ease.  Strong stood up, holding their petition in his hand, and glanced over it briefly even though he knew its contents by heart. He motioned to near-by chairs. "Sit down, please," he said.  The two spacemen settled themselves uncomfortably on the edge of their chairs and waited expectantly as Strong continued to look at the paper.  Loring finally broke the heavy silence.  "Well, Captain Strong, have you made a decision?" he asked. Loring was a heavy-set man, in his middle forties. He needed a shave, and when he talked, his mouth twisted into an ugly grimace.  "Hope it's in our favor, sir," suggested Mason. He was shorter than Loring and, seated, his feet hardly reached the floor. His eyes darted nervously about the huge room, and he kept rolling a dirty black spaceman's cap in his hands.  "Yes, I've reached a decision," said Strong slowly. He faced the two men and looked at both of them with a steady cold stare. "I've decided to sustain Major Connel's action. You are both grounded for the next twelve months. Earth months!"  "What?" shouted Loring, jumping to his feet. He banged his fist down on the desk and leaned over, his face close to Strong's. "You can't do that to us!"  Captain Strong didn't move. "I can," he said coldly. "And I have."  "But--but--" Mason began to whine. "But space flight is all we know! How will we live?"  Strong sat down and leaned back in his chair to get away from the foul odor of Loring's breath. He stared at the two men.  "You should have thought of that before you stole a rocket scout from the expedition and made an unauthorized flight while on Tara," Strong replied. "You're lucky you're not accused, tried, and convicted of theft of a Solar Guard spaceship!"  "We had permission to take that flight," snarled Loring. "That Major Connel is so blasted space happy he forgot he gave us permission. Then when we came back, he slapped us in the brig!"  "Do you have any proof of that?" asked Strong.  "No! But it's our word against his!" He slammed his hat down on the desk and shook his finger in Strong's face. "You haven't any right to take away our papers just on the say-so of a lousy Solar Guard officer who thinks he's king of the universe!"  "Take your filthy hat off my desk, Loring!" barked Strong. "And watch your language!"  Loring realized he had made a mistake and tried to backtrack. "Well, I apologize for that. But I _don't_ apologize for saying he thinks he's--"  "Major Connel has been in the Solar Guard for thirty years," said Strong emphatically. "He's been awarded the Solar Medal three times. No other living spaceman has achieved that! Not even Commander Walters! He rose through the ranks of the enlisted Solar Guard and was commissioned as an officer of the Solar Guard in space during an emergency. He qualifies higher than any other spaceman, and he has never been found to be unjust! He's one of the finest spacemen ever to hit the wide, deep, and high!" Strong stopped, choked for breath, and turned away. It wasn't often he lost his temper, but something had to be said in defense of his fellow officer, and particularly since that officer was Connel. He turned back to face the two spacemen, and his voice was hard and cold again.  "You are hereby suspended from space flight for twelve Earth months. Any further petition for appeal of this decision will be denied!"  "All right! All right, Mr. Big!" snapped Loring. "Does this mean we can't even ride as passengers?"  "No rights under the Universal Bill of Rights of the Solar Alliance have been denied you, except that of actively participating in the flight of a spaceship!"  The signal bell of the teleceiver began to chime softly, and on the desk the teleceiver screen glowed again. "Cadets Corbett, Manning, and Astro are here for their assignments, sir," announced the enlisted man outside.  Loring glared at Strong. "I suppose you're going to send some punk kids out on the next trip to Tara and leave us experienced spacemen to rot on the ground, huh?"  Strong didn't see the door slide open to admit the three cadets who entered quietly. His whole attention was focused on the ugly glaring faces of Bill Loring and Al Mason.  "Get this, Loring!" snapped Strong hotly. "The assignments of the _Polaris_ unit, whether it be to Tara or the Moon, has nothing to do with your own breech of conduct. In any case, if they were to be assigned, they'd do a better job than you 'experienced' spacemen who are disrespectful of your superior officers and break regulations! If either of you makes one more crack about the Solar Guard or Space Cadets, or _anything_ at all, I'll take you out on the quadrangle and pound some common courtesy into your heads! Now get out!"  "All right, all right--" muttered Loring retreating, but with a sneer on his lips. "We'll meet again, Mr. Bigshot Spaceman!"  "I hope so, Loring. And if we do, I hope you've taken a bath. You even smell bad!"  From the rear of the room came a burst of laughter. Tom, Roger, and Astro, unobserved, had been listening and watching their skipper in action. When Loring and Mason had left the room, they advanced to the desk, came to attention, and saluted.  "_Polaris_ unit reporting for duty, sir!" snapped Tom crisply.  "At ease," said Strong. "Did you hear all of that?"  "Yes, sir, skipper!" Roger smiled. "And believe me, you really gave it to those two space bums!"  "Yeah," agreed Astro, "but I don't think even _you_ could do much for Loring. He's just born to smell bad!"  "Never mind that," said Strong. "I suppose you heard the part about the assignments?"  The three cadets assumed looks of pure innocence.  "We didn't hear a thing, sir," said Tom.  "You'll make a fine diplomat, Corbett," Strong laughed. "All right, sit down and I'll give it to you straight."  They hastily took seats and waited for their skipper to begin.  "You've been assigned as cadet observers on a mission to test the range of a new long-range audio transmitter." Strong paused, then added significantly, "The test is to take place in deep space."  The three cadets only beamed their enthusiastic approval.  "Tara," continued Strong, "is your destination--a planet like Earth in many respects, in orbit around the sun star Alpha Centauri. You'll take the _Polaris_ directly to the Venus space station, where the transmitter has been given primary tests, outfit the _Polaris_ for hyperdrive, and blast off!"  "Excuse me, sir," interrupted Tom, "but you say 'you'?"  "I mean," replied Strong, "_you_, in the sense that I won't be going along with you. Oh, don't worry!" said Strong, holding up his hand as a sudden look of anticipation spread over the faces of the three boys. "You're not going alone! You'll have a commanding officer, all right. In fact, you'll have the nearest thing to the perfect commanding officer in the Solar Guard!" He waited just long enough for each boy to search his mind for a suitable candidate and then added, "Your skipper will be Major Connel!"  "Major Connel!" the three cadets cried in unison.  "You mean Major 'Blast-off' Connel?" uttered Roger unbelievingly.  "That's who I mean," said Strong. "It's the best thing in the universe that could happen to you!"  Roger stood up and saluted smartly. "I request permission to be dismissed from this mission on the grounds of incompatibility, sir," he said.  "Incompatible to what?" asked Strong, amused.  "To Major Connel, sir," replied Roger.  "Permission denied," said Strong with a smile. "Buck up! It isn't so bad." Strong paused and stood up. "Well, that's it. It's close to eleven A.M. and you're to report to the major at eleven on the nose. I hope you've got the _Polaris_ in good shape."  "We were up all night, sir," said Tom. "She's ready to go."  "She's in better shape than we are," said Astro.  "Very well, then. Report to Major Connel immediately. Your papers have been transferred, so all you have to do is report."  Strong rounded the desk and shook hands with each cadet. "This is an important mission, boys," he said soberly. "See that you give Major Connel all the support I know you're capable of giving. He'll need it. I doubt if I'll see you before you blast off, so this is it. Spaceman's luck to each of you!"  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 3   "Well, looks like we're big boys now," said Tom, as the three cadets strolled down the corridor away from Captain Strong's office. "They don't hand out secret and important missions to cadet units unless they're really on the ball!"  "But we've got Major 'Blast-off' Connel to educate," grumbled Roger.  "What do you mean 'educate'?" asked Astro.  "You know he's the roughest officer in the Academy," replied the blond-haired cadet. "He eats cadets for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. And then has an extra one for dessert. He isn't just tough--his hide's made of armor plate. But I've got a hunch that if we play dumb at first, then smarten up slowly, we can make him feel that he's done it for us. So he'll be easier on us."  "Say, it's after eleven!" exclaimed Tom. "We'd better hurry!"  Suddenly, as if a rocket cruiser were blasting off in the corridors, a roar, deafening and powerful, filled their ears. And beneath its ferocity there were four unmistakable words:  "_Polaris unit--staaaaaaaannnnnndddddd toooooo!_"  Every muscle, every bone in their three bodies snapped to rigid attention simultaneously. Eyes straight, chins in, the cadets waited for whatever calamity had befallen them. From behind came quick, heavy footsteps. They drew closer until they passed alongside and then abruptly stopped. There, in front of them, stood the one and only Major "Blast-off" Connel!  Though a few inches shorter than Astro, he was what Astro might become in thirty years, heavily muscular, with a barrel chest that filled the gold-and-black uniform tightly. He stood balanced on the balls of his small feet like a boxer, hands hanging loosely at his sides. A bulldog chin jutted out of his rough-hewn face as if it were going to snap off the head of the nearest cadet. He towered over Tom and Roger, and though shorter than Astro, he made up for this by sheer force of personality. When he spoke, his voice was like a deep foghorn that had suddenly learned the use of vowels.  "So this is the great _Polaris_ unit, eh?" he bellowed. "You're two minutes late!"  Tom suddenly felt that he and his unit-mates were all alone in the corridor with the major. He glanced to one side, then the other, cautiously, and saw it was empty. And for good reason! No one wanted to be around when "Blast-off" Connel was blasting. Cadets, enlisted men, and even officers were not safe from his sudden outbursts. He drove himself so hard that he became impatient with others who were not able to match his drive. It was not because of ego but rather to get the job at hand finished. More than once he had dressed down a captain of the Solar Guard in the same tone he used on a green Earthworm. It was legend around the Academy that once, believing he was right, he had broken into the Council Chamber itself to argue his point. He won by a unanimous decision. Nothing, but nothing, had been devised or thought of that could stop "Blast-off" Connel. Every waking moment of his adult life had been spent in the pursuit of more and more knowledge about space, space travel, and life on the other planets.  Now, his wrath at fever pitch at their being tardy, he stood in front of the cadets, turning his anger on Roger first.  "Your name's Manning, isn't it?" he growled.  "Yes, sir!" replied Roger.  "Father got a medal--used to be a Solar Guard officer?"  "That's right, sir. He was killed in space."  "I know. He was a good man. _You'll_ never be the man he was, if you live ten thousand years. But if you don't _try_ to be a better man than he was, you won't live five minutes with me! Is that clear, Cadet Manning?"  "Very clear, sir!" gulped Roger.  Connel turned to Astro.  "And you're the home-grown atomic-rocket genius, Venusian style, eh?"  "Yes, sir," choked Astro. "I'm from Venus."  "Bucked rockets on the old chemical burners as a kid before entering the Academy, eh?" asked Connel. There was less than an inch and a half between Astro's face and Major Connel's jaw.  "Yes, sir," answered Astro, "I was an enlisted man before coming to the Academy."  "Well, get this, you rocket buster," roared Connel. "I want a power deck that will give me what I want, when I want it, or you'll be back in the ranks again. Is that clear, Cadet Astro?"  "Yes, sir! Everything she's got, when you want it, sir."  "And I like to have a power deck clean enough to eat off the deck plates!"  "Yes, sir," stuttered Astro, growing more and more confused. "You like to eat off the deck plates, sir!"  "_By the craters of Luna, no!_ I don't like to eat off the deck plates, _but I want them clean enough to eat there if I want to!_"  "Yes, sir!" Astro's voice was hardly above a whisper.  "And you're the tactical wizard that won the space maneuvers recently, singlehanded, eh?" asked Connel, bending down to face Tom.  "Our side won, sir. If that answers your question," replied Tom. He was as nervous as Roger and Astro, but he fought for control. He was determined not to be bullied.  "I didn't ask you who won!" snapped Connel. "But you're the one just the same. Control-deck cadet, eh? Well, you work with me. On the control deck there's only room for one brain, one decision, one answer. And when I'm on the control deck, that decision, answer, and brain will be mine!"  "I understand perfectly, sir," said Tom tonelessly.  Connel stepped back, fists on his hips, eying the three cadets. He had heard about their difficulty in fitting personalities together when they had first arrived at Space Academy (as described in _Stand By for Mars!_). And he had heard about their triumph over the Martian desert. He was impressed with everything he had learned about them, but he knew that he had a reputation for being tough and that this reputation usually brought out the best in cadets. Early in his long and brilliant career he had learned that his life depended on the courage and ingenuity of his fellow spacemen. When he became an instructor at the Academy, he had determined that no cadet would ever be anything but the best, and that, when they blasted off in later years, they could be depended on.  He looked at the three cadets and felt a tinge of excitement that did not show on his scowling face. "Yes," he thought, "they'll make spacemen. It'll take a little time--but they're good material."  "_Now listen to this!_" he bawled. "We blast off for the Venus space station in exactly thirty minutes. Get your gear aboard the _Polaris_ and stand by to raise ship." He dropped his voice and pushed out his jaw a little farther. "This will be the toughest journey you'll ever make. You'll either come back spacemen, or you'll come back nothing. I'm going to try my best to make it"--he paused and added coldly--"_nothing!_ Because if you can't take it from me, then you don't belong in space! Unit _dis_-missed!"  He turned on his heel and disappeared up the slidestairs without another look at the three rigid cadets.  "Yeah--we'll educate him, all right," said Astro softly, with a wink at Tom. "Make him think he's done everything for us."  "Ah, go blast your jets!" snarled Roger after he had found his voice.  "Come on," said Tom. "Let's get the _Polaris_ ready. And, fellows, I mean _ready_!"   Bill Loring and Al Mason stood near the entrance to the control tower of the Academy spaceport and watched the three cadets of the _Polaris_ scramble into the giant rocket cruiser.  "Every time I think about that Connel kicking us out of space for twelve months I wanta pound his head in with a wrench!" snarled Loring.  Mason snorted. "Well, what's the use of hanging around here?" he asked. "That Connel wouldn't have us aboard the _Polaris_, even if we were cleared and had our papers. There ain't a thing we can do!"  "Don't give up so easy. There's a fortune setting up there in space--just waiting for me and you to come and take it. And no big-shot Solar Guard officer is going to keep me from getting it!"  "Yeah--yeah," grumbled Mason, "but what are you going to do about it?"  "I'll show you what I'm going to do!" said Loring. "We're heading for Venusport."  "Venusport? By the moons of Jupiter, what are we going to do there?"  "Get a free ride to Tara!"  "But how? I only got a few hundred credits and you ain't got much more. There ain't nobody going to go fifty billion miles on nothing!"  Loring's eyes followed the massive figure of Major Connel on the slidewalk as it swept across the spaceport field toward the _Polaris_. "You just buy us a coupla seats on the next rocket to Venusport and stop asking stupid questions. When we see Major 'Blast-off' Connel again, we'll be giving the orders with a paralo-ray!"  The two disgruntled spacemen turned quickly and walked to the nearest slidewalk, disappearing around a building.  Aboard the _Polaris_, Tom confronted his two unit-mates.  "Now look, fellows. After the hard time Major Connel just gave us, let's see if we can't really stay on the ball from now on."  "All right by me, Tom," Astro said, nodding his head.  "You're having space dreams, Corbett!" drawled Roger. "No matter what we do for old 'Blast-off' we'll wind up behind the eight ball."  "But if we really try," urged Tom, "if we all do our jobs, there can't be anything for him to fuss about."  "We'll make it tough for him to give us any demerits," Astro chimed in.  "Right," said Tom.  "It won't work," grumbled Roger. "You saw the way he chewed us up, and for what? I ask you--for what?"  "He was just trying to live up to his reputation, Roger," replied Tom. "But common sense will tell you that if you're on the ball you won't get demerits."  "What's the matter, hot-shot?" growled Astro. "Afraid of a little work?"  "Listen, you Venusian clunk," sneered Roger, "I'll work the pants off you any day in the week, and that includes Titan days, too!"  "O.K." Tom smiled. "Save half of that energy for the _Polaris_, Roger."  "Yeah, use some of that Manning hot air to shine brass!" suggested Astro.  "Come on. Let's get this wagon in shape," said Tom. He turned to the instrument panel and the great control board.  A moment later the three cadets were busy shining the few bits of brass and rechecking the many controls and levers. Suddenly there was the sound of a hatch slamming below and then Astro's voice came whispering over the intercom, "... watch it, fellows. Here he comes!"  The airtight hatch leading to the control deck slid back, and Major Connel stepped inside. With one sweeping glance he took in the control deck and the evidence of their work.  "Unit--_staaaaand to!_" he roared.  Astro climbed into the control deck and snapped to attention with his unit-mates as Connel began a quick but thorough check of the many dials and switches and relays on the control panel.  "Ummmmh," he mused. "Been doing a little work, I see."  "Oh, nothing special, sir," said Roger.  "Well, from now on it's going to be special!" roared Connel.  "Yes, sir," acknowledged Roger quickly.  "All right, at ease," ordered Connel. As the three boys relaxed, Connel stepped over to the astrogation board and snapped a switch. Immediately a solar chart filled the huge chart screen. It was a black-and-white view of the planet Venus.  "This is where we're going first," he said, placing a finger on a ball-shaped satellite in orbit around the misty planet. "This is the Venus space station. As you know, Venus has no natural satellite of its own, so we built one. We'll blast off from here and go directly to the space station where the _Polaris_ will be fitted with hyperdrive for deep-space operations. While at the station you will acquaint yourselves with the operation of the new audio communications transmitter. When I'm satisfied that you can handle it under the prevailing conditions of an extended space flight, we'll blast off for a test of its range and performance."  Major Connel paused and faced the cadets squarely. Then he continued: "This is an important mission--one which I hope will enable the Solar Guard to establish the first base outside of our solar system. Our destination is Tara, in the star system of Alpha Centauri. Tara is a planet in a stage of development similar to that of Earth several million years ago. Its climate is tropical, and lush vegetation--jungles really--covers the land surface. Two great oceans separate the land masses. One is called Alpha, the other Omega. I was on the first expedition, when Tara was discovered, and have just returned from the second, during which we explored it and ran tests to learn if it could sustain human life. All tests show that Tara can be transformed into a paradise."  Connel paused, took a deep breath, and continued: "I shall expect more than just hard work from you. I want everything you have to offer. Not just good performance, but _excellence_! I will not tolerate anything less, and if I'm forced to resort to extreme disciplinary action to get what I demand, then you can expect to receive every demerit in the book!" He stepped closer to the three cadets. "Remember! Spacemen--or _nothing!_ Now, stand by to blast off!"  Without a word, the three cadets hurried to their stations and began routine procedure to raise ship.  "All departments ready to blast off, Major Connel," reported Tom, saluting sharply.  "Very well, Corbett, proceed," said Connel.  Tom called into the intercom, "Stand by for blast-off!" He then opened the circuit to the teleceiver screen overhead and spoke to the spaceport control tower.  "_Polaris_ to spaceport control. Request permission to blast off. Request orbit."  "Spaceport traffic to _Polaris_. Your orbit has been cleared 089--repeat 089--blast off in two minutes ..."  "Orbit 089--blast off minus one fifty-nine fifty-eight."  "You read me clear, _Polaris_ ..."  Tom clicked off the switch and turned to the intercom. "Control deck to radar bridge. Do we have a clear tangent forward and up?"  "All clear forward and up, Tom," replied Roger.  "Control deck to power deck. Energize the cooling pumps!"  "Cooling pumps in operation," answered Astro briskly.  The giant ship began to shudder as the mighty pumps on the power deck started their slow, whining build-up. Tom sat in front of the control panel, strapped himself into the acceleration chair, and began checking the dials and gauges. Satisfied everything was in order, he fastened his eyes to the sweeping red second hand on the solar clock. The teleceiver screen brought a sharp picture of the surrounding base of the spaceship, and he saw that it was all clear. The second hand reached the ten-second mark.  "Stand by to raise ship!" bawled Tom into the intercom. The red hand moved steadily, surely, to the zero at the top of the clock face. Tom reached for the master switch.  "Blast off minus five--four--three--two--one--_zero!_"  Tom threw the switch.  Slowly the giant ship raised itself from the ground. Then faster and faster, pushing the four spacemen deep into their acceleration cushions, it hurtled spaceward.  In a few seconds the _Polaris_ was gravity-free. Once again, Earthmen had started another journey to the stars.     CHAPTER 4   "Stand by to reduce speed three-quarters!" roared Major Connel.  "Aye, aye, sir," replied Tom, and began the necessary adjustments on the control panel. He spoke into the intercom. "Control deck to power deck. Stand by to reduce thrust on main drive rockets by three-quarters. We're coming onto the space station, Astro."  "Power deck, aye," acknowledged Astro.  Drifting in a steady orbit around its mother planet, the Venus space station loomed ahead of the _Polaris_ like a huge metal ball set against a backdrop of cold, black space. It was studded with gaping holes, air locks which served as landing ports for spaceships. Inside the station was a compact city. Living quarters, communications rooms, repair shops, weather observations, meteor information, everything to serve the great fleet of Solar Guard and merchant spaceships plying the space lanes between Earth, Mars, Venus, and Titan.  "I'm getting the identification request from the station, sir. Shall I answer her?" asked Roger over the intercom.  "Of course, you space-brained idiot, and make it fast!" exploded Connel. "What do you want to do? Get us blasted out of space?"  "Yes, sir!" replied Roger. "Right away, sir!"  Tom kept his eyes on the teleceiver screen above his head. The image of the space station loomed large and clear.  "Approaching a little too fast, I think, sir," volunteered Tom. "Shall I make the adjustment?"  "What's the range?" asked Connel.  Tom named a figure.  "Ummmmh," mused Connel. He glanced quickly over the dials and then nodded in assent. Tom turned once more to the intercom. "Control deck to power deck," he called. "Stand by for maneuvering, Astro, and reduce your main drive thrust to minimum space speed."  "Space station traffic control to rocket cruiser _Polaris_. Come in, _Polaris_. This is traffic control on space station to _Polaris_," the audio teleceiver crackled.  "Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to space station and traffic control. Request touchdown permission and landing-port number," replied Tom.  "Permission to touch down granted, _Polaris_. You are to line up on approach to landing-port seven--repeat--seven. Am now sending out guiding radar beam. Can you read beam?"  Tom turned to the intercom. "Have you got the station's guiding beam, Roger?"  "All lined up, Tom," replied Roger from the radar bridge. "Get that Venusian on the power deck to give me a three-second shot on the starboard rocket, if he can find the right handles!"  "I heard that, Manning!" roared Astro's voice on the intercom. "Another crack like that and I'll make you get out and push this baby around!"  "_You execute that order and do it blasted quick!_" Major Connel's voice exploded over the intercom. "And watch that loose talk on the ship's intercom. From now on, all directions and orders will be given and received in a crisp, clear manner without unnecessary familiarity!"  Connel didn't expect them to acknowledge his order. The cadets had heard him and that was enough. He knew it was enough. In the short time it had taken them to traverse the immense gulf of space between the Academy and the station Connel had handed out demerits by fives and tens! Each of the cadets was now tagged with enough black marks to spend two months in the galley working them off!  Now, working together like the smooth team of junior spacemen they were, Tom, Roger, and Astro maneuvered the great rocket ship toward the gaping hole of the air lock in the side of the white ball-like satellite.  "Drop your bow one half degree, _Polaris_, you're up too high," warned the station control.  "A short burst on the upper trim rocket, Astro," called Tom.  The great ship bucked slightly under the force of sudden thrust, and then its nose dropped the required half degree.  "Cut all thrust and brake your speed to dead ship, _Polaris_," ordered traffic control.  Again Tom relayed the order to Astro, and a moment later the great ship hung silently in the airless void of space, a scant half mile from the station.  [Illustration: _The junior spaceman maneuvered the great rocket ship toward the air lock_]  Through the teleceiver Tom could see the jet boats darting out from the station carrying the magnetic cables. In a moment the lines were attached to the steel skin of the ship, and gradually the lines tightened, pulling the mighty spaceship into the waiting port. Once inside, the outer air lock was closed and the _Polaris_ was slung in the powerful magnetic cradles that held her in a rigid position. Elsewhere on the satellite, quick calculations were made for the additional weight, and the station was counterbalanced to assure an even orbit around Venus.  Tom flicked the many switches off on the great board, glanced at the time of arrival on the solar clock, and reported to Major Connel.  "Touchdown at one-nine-four-nine, sir."  "Very well, Corbett," answered Connel. Then he added grudgingly, "That was as fine a job of control-deck operations as I've seen. Keep up the good work, spaceman."  Tom gulped. The unexpected compliment caught him off guard. And he was even more pleased that for the first time Connel had referred to him as spaceman!  "I'll be needed at the space station commander's quarters for a while, Corbett," said Connel. "Meanwhile, you and Manning and Astro acquaint yourselves with the station. Report to me back aboard the ship in exactly two hours. Dismissed."  Tom saluted, and Connel disappeared toward the exit port.  "Well, _spaceman_," Roger drawled casually from behind, "it looks like you've got yourself in solid with the old man!"  Tom smiled. "With a guy like that, Roger, you're never in solid. Maybe I did get a pat on the back, but you didn't hear him cancel any of those demerits he gave me for not signing the logbook after that last watch, did you?"  "Let's get some chow," growled Astro, who came hustling through the hatch. "I'm half starved. By the craters of Luna, how many times can you change course in five minutes?"  Astro referred to the countless times Tom had had to call for fraction-degree course changes in their approach to the gaping entrance port.  Tom laughed. "With Connel on the bridge, you're lucky I didn't give you twice as many," he replied. "Can you imagine what would have happened if we had missed and hit the station?"  "Brrrrrr!" shuddered Roger. "I hate to think about it. Come on. Let's rustle up some grub for the Venusian. I could use some myself."  The three boys quickly changed to their dress blue cadet uniforms and left the ship. A moment later they were being whisked up an electric elevator to the main--or "street"--level. The door opened, and they stepped out into a large circular area about the size of a city block in the rear of the station. The area had been broken into smaller sections. One side of the "street" was devoted to shops, a small stereo house which was playing the latest Liddy Tamal hit, "Children of Space" (a sensational drama about the lives of men in the future), restaurants, and even a curio shop. The Venus space station handled ninety per cent of the traffic into and out of Venusport. It was a refueling stop for the jet liners and space freighters bound for the outer planets, and for those returning to Earth. Some ships went directly to Venusport for heavy overhaul or supplies, but the station was established primarily for quick turn arounds. Several ex-enlisted spacemen who had been injured or retired were given special permission to open shops for the convenience of the passengers and crews of the ships and the staff of the station. In twenty years the station had become a place where summer tourists from Earth and winter tourists from Titan made a point of stopping. The first of its kind in the universe, it was as near a perfect place to live as could be built by man.  Tom, Roger, and Astro strolled down the short street, pushing through a crowd of tourists admiring the shops. Finally they found a restaurant that specialized in Venusian dishes.  "Now you two spindly Earthmen are going to have the best meal of your lives! Broiled dinosaur on real Venusian black bread!"  "D-dinosaur!" stuttered Tom in amazement. "Why--why--that's a prehistoric monster!"  "Yeah, Astro," agreed Roger. "What are you trying to hand us?"  Astro laughed. "You'll see, fellows," he replied. "I used to go hunting for them when I was a kid. Brought the best price of any wild game. Fifty credits for babies under three hundred pounds. Over that, you can't eat 'em. Too tough!"  Tom and Roger looked at each other, eyes bulging.  "Ah, come on, Tom," drawled Roger. "He's just trying to pull our leg."  Without a word, Astro grabbed them by the arms and rushed them into the restaurant. They were no sooner seated when a recorded voice announced the menu over a small loud-speaker on the table. Astro promptly ordered dinosaur, and to his unit-mates' amazement, the voice politely inquired:  "Would the spacemen prefer to have it broiled a la Venusian black bread, baked, or raw?"  A sharp look from Roger and Tom, and Astro ordered it broiled.  One hour and fifteen minutes later the three members of the _Polaris_ unit staggered out of the restaurant.  "By the rings of Saturn," declared Tom, "that wasn't only the most I ever ate--it was the best!"  Roger nodded in silent agreement, leaning against the plastic window in front of the restaurant.  "You see," Astro beamed, "maybe you guys will listen to me from now on!"  "Boy, I can't wait to see Mom's face when I tell her that her chicken and dumplings have taken second place to broiled monster!"  "By the jumping blazes of the stars!" yelled Roger suddenly. "Look at the time! We're ten minutes late!"  "Ohhhhh," moaned Tom. "I knew it was too good to be true!"  "Step on it!" said Astro. "Maybe he won't notice."  "Some chance," groaned Roger, running after Tom and Astro. "That old rocket head wouldn't miss anything!"  The three boys raced back to the electric elevator and were silently whisked to the air-lock level. They hurried aboard the _Polaris_ and into the control room. Major Connel was seated in a chair near the chart screen, studying some papers. The cadets drew themselves to attention.  "Unit reporting for duty, sir," Tom quavered.  Connel spun around in the swivel chair, glanced at the clock, put the papers to one side, and slowly advanced toward the cadets.  "Thirteen and a half minutes late!" he said, dropping his voice to a biting growl. "I'll give you five seconds to think up a good excuse. Every man is entitled to an excuse. Some have good ones, some have truthful ones, and some have excuses that sound as though they made them up in five seconds!"  He eyed the cadets speculatively. "Well?" he demanded.  "I'm afraid we were carried away by our enthusiasm for a meal Astro introduced us to, sir," said Tom honestly.  "All right," snapped Connel, "then here's something else to carry you all away!" He paused and rocked on the balls of his feet. "I had planned to give you three liberty of the station while here, whenever you weren't working on the new transmitter. But since you have shown yourselves to be carried away so easily, I don't think I can depend on your completing your regular duties. Therefore, I suggest that each of you report to the officer in charge of your respective departments and learn the operation and function of the station while we're here. This work will be _in addition_ to your assigned duties on the new transmitter operation!"  The three cadets gulped but were silent.  "Not only that," Connel's voice had risen to an angry bark, "but you will be logged a demerit apiece for each minute you reported late. Thirteen and a half minutes, thirteen and a half demerits!"  The gold and black of the Solar Guard uniform never looked more ominous as the three cadets watched the stern spaceman turn and stomp out the exit port.  Alone, their liberty taken away from them before they even knew they had it, the boys sat around on the control deck of the silent ship and listened to the distant throb of a pump, rising and falling, pumping free air throughout the station.  "Well," sighed Tom, "I always did want to know how a space station worked. Now I guess I'll learn firsthand."  "Me, too," said Astro. He propped his big feet up on a delicate instrument panel of the control board.  "Me, too!" sneered Roger, his voice filled with a bitterness that surprised Tom and Astro. "But I didn't think I would find out like this! How in the universe has that--that tyrant managed to stay alive this long!"     CHAPTER 5   "The space station's biggest headache," said Terry Scott, a young Solar Guard officer assigned the job of showing the _Polaris_ crew around, "is to maintain perfect balance at all times."  "How do you achieve that, sir?" asked Tom.  "We create our own gravity by means of a giant gyroscope in the heart of the station. When more weight is taken aboard, or weight leaves the station, we have to adjust the gyro's speed."  They entered the power deck of the great ball-like satellite. Astro's eyes glowed with pleasure as he glanced approvingly from one massive machine to another. The fuel tanks were made of thin durable aluminite; a huge cylinder, covered with heat-resistant paint, was the air conditioner; power came from a bank of atomic dynamos and generators; while those massive pumps kept the station's artificial air and water supply circulating.  Dials, gauges, meters, were arrayed in seemingly endless rows--but each one of them actually played its part in keeping the station in balance.  Astro's face was one big, delighted grin.  "Well," said Roger with a sly wink at Tom, "you can't tell me that Connel has made our Venusian unhappy. Even if he had given us liberty, I'll bet Astro would have spent it down here with the grease monkeys!"  Astro didn't rise to the bait. His attention was riveted on a huge dynamo, which he watched with appreciative eyes. But then Terry Scott introduced the _Polaris_ unit to an older Solar Guard officer.  "Cadets, meet Captain Jenledge," said Scott. "And, sir, this is Cadet Astro. Major Connel would like him to work with you while he's here."  "Glad to know you, boys," said Jenledge, "and particularly you, Cadet Astro. I've heard about your handiness with the thrust buckets on the cruisers. What do you think of our layout?"  The officer turned and waved his hand to indicate the power-deck equipment.  "This is just about the finest--the most terrif--"  The officer smiled at Astro's inability to describe his feelings. Jenledge was proud of his power deck, proud of the whole establishment, for that matter. He had conceived it, had drawn the plans, and had constructed this space station.  Throughout the solar system it was considered his baby. And when he had asked for permission to remain on as senior power-deck chief, the Solar Alliance had jumped at the chance to keep such a good man on the job. The station had become a sort of postgraduate course for power-deck cadets and junior Solar Guard officers.  Astro beamed. So, the great Jenledge had actually heard of him--of humble Cadet Astro. He could hardly restrain himself from ripping off his blue uniform and going right to work on a near-by machine that had been torn apart for repairs. Finally he managed to gasp, "I think it's great, sir--just wonderful!"  "Very well, Cadet Astro," said the officer. "There's a pair of coveralls in my locker. You can start right to work." He paused and his eyes twinkled. "If you want to, that is!"  "Want to!" roared Astro, and was off to the locker room.  Jenledge turned to Scott. "Leave him with me, Scotty. I don't think Cadet Astro's going to care much about the rest of the station!"  Scott smiled, saluted, and walked away. Tom and Roger came to attention, saluted, and followed the young officer off the power deck.  "Astro's probably happier now than he'll ever be in his life, Tom," whispered Roger.  "Yeah," agreed Tom. "Did you see the way his eyes lit up when we walked in there? Like a kid with a brand-new toy!"  A moment later Scott, Tom, and Roger, in a vacuum elevator, were being hurtled to the station's upper decks. They got out on the observation deck, and Scott walked directly to a small door at the end of a corridor. A light over the door flashed red and Scott stopped.  "Here's the weather and meteor observation room," he said. "Also radar communications. When the red light's on, it means photographs are being taken. We'll have to wait for them to finish."  As they waited, Tom and Roger talked to Scott. He had graduated from Space Academy seven years before, they learned. He'd been assigned to the Solar Alliance Chamber as liaison between the Chamber and the Solar Guard. After four years, he had requested a transfer to active space operations.  Then, he told them, there'd been an accident. His ship exploded. He'd been badly injured--in fact, both his legs were now artificial.  The cadets, who had thought him a bit stuffy at first, were changing their minds fast. Why hadn't he quit, they wanted to know?  "Leave space?" said Scott. "I'd rather die. I can't blast off any more. But here at the station I'm still a spaceman."  The red light went out, and they opened the door.  In sharp contrast to the bustle and noise on the power deck, the meteor, weather, and radar observation room was filled with only a subdued whisper. All around them huge screens displayed various views of the surface of Venus as it slowly revolved beneath the station. Along one side of the room was a solid bank of four-foot-square teleceiver screens with an enlisted spaceman or junior officer seated in front of each one. These men, at their microphones, were relaying meteor and weather information to all parts of the solar system. Now it was Roger's turn to get excited at seeing the wonderful radar scanners that swept space for hundreds of thousands of miles. They were powerful enough to pick up a spaceship's identifying outline while still two hundred thousand miles away! Farther to one side, a single teleceiver screen, ten feet square, dominated the room. Roger gasped.  Scott smiled. "That's the largest teleceiver screen in the universe," he said. "The most powerful. And it's showing you a picture of the Andromeda Galaxy, thousands of light years away. Most of the lights you see there are no more than that, just light, their stars, or suns, having long ago exploded or burned. But the light continues to travel, taking thousands of years to reach our solar system."  "But--but--" gasped Tom. "How can you be so accurate with this screen? It looks as though we were smack in the center of the galaxy itself!"  "There's a fifty-inch telescope attached to the screen," Scott replied, "which is equal to the big one-thousand-inch 'eye' back at the Academy."  "Why is that, sir?" asked Roger.  "You don't get any distortion from atmosphere up here," replied the young officer.  As Tom and Roger walked silently among the men at the teleceiver screens, Scott continued to explain. "This is where you'll be, Manning," he said, indicating a large radarscope scanner a little to one side and partially hidden from the glow of the huge teleceiver screen. "We need a man on watch here twenty-four hours a day, though there isn't much doing between midnight and eight A.M. on radar watch. A little traffic, but nothing compared to what we get during the regular working day."  "Any particular reason for that, sir?" asked Tom.  "Oh, there just aren't many arrivals and departures during that period. We have night crews to handle light traffic, but by midnight the station is pretty much like any sleepy Middle Western town. Rolls up the sidewalks and goes to bed."  He motioned to Roger to follow him to the radar section and left Tom watching the interesting spectacle on the giant teleceiver. A huge star cluster flashed brilliantly, filling the screen with light, then faded into the endless blackness of space. Tom caught his breath as he remembered what Scott had told him about the light being thousands of years old before reaching the solar system.  "Manning's all set, Corbett," said Scott at Tom's elbow. "Come on. I'll show you the traffic-control deck."  Tom followed the young officer out of the room. As all true spacemen do at one time or another in their lives, he thought about the pitifully small part mankind had played so far in the conquest of the stars. Man had come a long way, Tom was ready to admit, but there was still a lot of work ahead for young, courageous spacemen.  As Scott and Tom climbed the narrow stairs to the traffic-control deck, the Solar Guard officer continued to speak of the man-made satellite. "When the station was first built," he said, "it was expected to be just a way station for refueling and celestial observations. But now we're finding other uses for it, just as though it were a small community on Earth, Mars, or Venus. In fact, they're now planning to build still larger stations." Scott opened the door to the traffic-control room. He motioned to Tom to follow him.  [Illustration]  This room, Tom was ready to admit, was the busiest place he had ever seen in his life. All around the circular room enlisted Solar Guardsmen sat at small desks, each with a monitoring board in front of him holding three teleceiver screens. As he talked into a mike near by, each man, by shifting from one screen to the next, was able to follow the progress of a spaceship into or out of the landing ports. One thing puzzled Tom. He turned to Scott.  "Sir, how come some of those screens show the _station_ from the _outside_?" he asked. Tom pointed to a screen in front of him that had a picture of a huge jet liner just entering a landing port.  "Two-way teleceivers, Corbett," said Scott with a smile. "When you arrived on the _Polaris_, didn't you have a view of the station on your teleceiver?"  "Yes, sir," answered Tom, "of course."  "Well, these monitors picked up your image on the _Polaris_ teleceiver. So the traffic-control chief here could see exactly what you were seeing."  In the center of the circular room Tom noticed a round desk that was raised about eight feet from the floor. This desk dominated all activity in the busy room. Inside it stood a Solar Guard officer, watching the monitoring teleceivers. He wore a throat microphone for sending out messages, and for receiving calls had a thin silver wire running to the vibrating bone in his ear. He moved constantly, turning in a circle, watching the various landing ports on the many screens. Three-thousand-ton rocket liners, Solar Guard cruisers, scout ships, and destroyers all moved about the satellite lazily, waiting for permission to enter or depart. This man was the master traffic-control officer who had first contacted Tom on his approach to the station. He did that for all approaching ships--contacted them, got the recognition signal, found out the ship's destination, its weight, and its cargo or passenger load.  Then the connection was relayed to one of the secondary control officers at the monitoring boards.  "That's Captain Stefens," said Scott in a whisper. "Toughest officer on the station. He has to be. From five hundred to a thousand ships arrive and depart daily. It's his job to see that every arriving ship is properly taken into the landing ports. Besides that, everything you've seen, except the meteor and weather observation rooms, are under his command. If he thinks a ship is overloaded, he won't allow it to enter and disrupt the balance of the station. Instead, he'll order its skipper to dump part of his cargo out in space to be picked up later. He makes hundreds of decisions a day--some of them really hair-raising. Once, when a rocket scout crew was threatened with exploding reactant mass, he calmly told them to blast off into a desolate spot in space and blow up. The crew could have abandoned ship, but they chose to remain with it and were blown to atoms. It could have happened to the station. That night he got a three-day pass from the station and went to Venusport."  Scott shook his head. "I've heard Venusport will never be the same after that three-day pass of Captain Stefens."  The young officer looked at Corbett quizzically. "That's the man you're going to work for."  Scott walked over to the circular desk and spoke rapidly to the officer inside. As Tom approached, Stefens gave him a quick, sharp glance. It sent a shiver down the cadet's spine. Scott waved to him to come over.  "Captain Stefens, this is Cadet Tom Corbett."  Tom came to attention.  "All right, Corbett," said Stefens, speaking like a man who had a lot to do, knew how to do it, liked to do it, and was losing time. "Stand up here with me and keep your mouth shut. Remember any questions you want to ask, and when I have a spare moment, ask them. And by the rings of Saturn, be sure I'm free to answer. Take my attention at the wrong moment and we could have a bad accident."  Stefens gave Scott a fleeting smile and turned back to his constant keen-eyed inspection of the monitors.  The radar watch was reporting the approach of a ship. Stefens began his cold, precise orders.  "Monitor seven, take freighter out of station on port sixty-six; monitor twelve, stand by for identification signal of jet liner coming in from Mars. Watch her closely. The Venusport Space Line is overloading again...." On and on he went, with Tom standing to one side watching with wide-eyed wonder as the many ships were maneuvered into and out of the station.  Suddenly Stefens turned to Tom. "Well, Corbett," he rasped, "what's the first question?"  Tom gulped. He had been so fascinated by the room's sheer magic and by Stefens' sure control of the traffic that he hadn't had a chance to think.  "I--I--don't have one--yet, sir," he managed finally.  "I want five questions within five minutes!" snapped Stefens, "and they better be rocket-blasting _good questions_!" He turned back to the monitors.  Tom Corbett, while he had gained the respect of many elder spacemen, was discovering that a cadet's life got no easier as time went on. He wondered fleetingly how Roger and Astro were making out, and then he began to think of some questions.  Beside him, oblivious of his presence, Stefens continued to spout directions. "Monitor three, take rocket scout out of landing-port eight. One crew member is remaining aboard the station for medical treatment. He weighs one hundred and fifty-eight pounds. Make balance adjustments accordingly...."  Tom's head was spinning. It was all too much for one young cadet to absorb on such short notice.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 6   "There goes the jet liner to Mars," said Al Mason wistfully. "Sure wish we wuz on her." His eyes followed the beautiful slim passenger ship just blasting off from Venus.  "Why?" demanded Loring.  "Anything to get away from Venusport. What a stinking hole!" snorted the shorter of the two spacemen.  "For what we want to do," said Loring, "there ain't another city in the system that's got the advantages this place has!"  "Don't talk to me about advantages," whined Mason. "Be darned if I can see any. All we been doing is hang around the spaceport, talk to the spacemen, and watch the ships blast off. Maybe you're up to something but I'm blasted if I see what it can be."  "I've been looking for the right break to come along."  "What kind of break?" growled Mason.  "That kind," said Loring. He pointed to a distant figure emerging from a space freighter. "There's our answer!" said Loring, a note of triumph in his voice. "Come on. Let's get outta here. I don't want to be recognized."  "But--but--what's up? What's that guy and the space freighter _Annie Jones_ got to do with us?"  Loring didn't answer but stepped quickly to the nearest jet cab and hopped into the back seat. Mason tumbled in after him.  "Spaceman's Row," Loring directed, "and make it quick!"  The driver stepped on the accelerator and the red teardrop-shaped vehicle shot away from the curb into the crowd of cars racing along Premier Highway Number One. In the back seat of the jet cab, Loring turned to his spacemate and slapped him on the back.  "Soon's we get into the Row, you go and pack our gear, see! Then meet me at the Cafe Cosmos in half an hour."  "Pack our gear?" asked Mason with alarm. "Are we going some place?"  Loring shot a glance at the driver. "Just do as I tell you!" he growled. "In a few hours we'll be on our way to Tara, and then--" He dropped his voice to a whisper. Mason listened and smiled.  The jet cab slid along the arrow-straight highway toward the heart of the city of Venusport. Soon it reached the outskirts. On both sides of the highway rose low, flat-roofed dwellings, built on a revolving wheel to follow the precious sun, and constructed of pure Titan crystal. Farther ahead and looming magnificent in the late afternoon sun was the first and largest of Venusian cities, Venusport. Like a fantastically large diamond, the startling towers of the young city shot upward into the misty atmosphere, catching the light and reflecting it in every color of the spectrum.  Loring and Mason did not appreciate the beauty of the city as they rode swiftly through the busy streets. Loring, in particular, thought as he had never thought before. He was busily putting a plot together in his mind--a plot as dangerous as it was criminal.  [Illustration: _The jet cab raced along the highway to Venusport_]  The jet cab slammed to a stop at a busy intersection of the city. This was Spaceman's Row, and it dated back to Venusport's first rough and tough pioneering days.  For two blocks on either side of the street, in building after building, cafes, pawnshops, cheap restaurants above and below the street level, supplied the needs of countless shadowy figures who came and went as silently as ghosts. Spaceman's Row was where suspended spacemen and space rats, prospectors of the asteroids for uranium and pitchblende, gathered and found short-lived and rowdy fun. Here, skippers of rocket ships, bound for destinations in deep space, could find hands willing to sign on their dirty freighters despite low pay and poor working conditions. No questions were asked here. Along Spaceman's Row, hard men played a grim game of survival.  Loring and Mason paid the driver, got out, and walked down the busy street. Here and there, nuaniam signs began to flick on, their garish blues, reds, and whites bathing the street in a glow of synthetic light. It was early evening, but already Spaceman's Row was getting ready for the coming night.  Presently, Mason left Loring, climbing up a long narrow flight of stairs leading to a dingy back hall bedroom to pack their few remaining bits of gear.  Loring walked on amid the noise and laughter that echoed from cheap restaurants and saloons. Stopping before Cafe Cosmos, he surveyed the street quickly before entering the wide doors. Many years before, the Cosmos had been a sedate dining spot, a place where respectable family parties came to enjoy good food and the gentle breezes of a near-by lake. Now, with the lake polluted by industry and with the gradual influx of shiftless spacemen, the Cosmos had been given over to the most basic, simple need of its new patrons--rocket juice!  The large room that Loring entered still retained some of the features of its more genteel beginnings, but the huge blaring teleceiver screen was filled with the pouting face of a popular singer. He advanced to the bar that occupied one entire wall.  "Rocket juice!" he said, slamming down his fist on the wooden bar. "Double!" He was served a glass of the harsh bluish liquid, paid his credits, and downed the drink. Then he turned slowly and glanced around the half-filled room. Almost immediately he spotted a small wizened man limping toward him.  "Been waiting for you," said the man.  "Well," demanded Loring, "did'ja get anything set up, Shinny?"  "_Mr._ Shinny!" growled the little man, with surprising vigor. "I'm old enough to be your father!"  "Awright--awright--_Mr._ Shinny!" sneered Loring. "Did'ja get it?"  The little man shook his head. "Nothing on the market, Billy boy." He paused and aimed a stream of tobacco juice at a near-by cuspidor.  Loring looked relieved. "Just as well. I've got something else lined up, anyway."  Shinny's eyes sharpened. "You must have a pretty big strike, Billy boy, if you're so hot to buy a spaceship!"  "Only want to take a little ride upstairs, _Mr._ Shinny," said Loring.  "Don't hand me that space gas!" snapped Shinny. "A man who's lost his space papers ain't going to take a chance at getting caught by the Solar Guard, busting the void with a rocket ship and no papers." He stopped, and his small gray eyes twinkled. "_Unless_," he added, "you've got quite a strike lined up!"  "Hey, Loring!" yelled Mason, entering the cafe. He carried two spaceman's traveling bags, small black plastic containers with glass zippers.  "So you've got Al Mason in with you," mused Shinny. "Pretty good man, Al. Let's see now, I saw you two just before you blasted off for Tara!" He paused. "Couldn't be that you've got anything lined up in deep space, now could it?"  "You're an old fool!" snarled Loring.  "Heh--heh--heh," chuckled Shinny. A toothless smile spread across his wrinkled face. "Coming close, am I?"  Al Mason looked at Shinny and back at Loring. "Say! What is this?" he demanded.  "O.K., O.K.," said Loring between clenched teeth. "So we've got a strike out in the deep, but one word outta line from you and I'll blast you with my heater!"  "Not a word," said Shinny, "not a word. I'll only charge you a little to keep your secret."  Mason looked at Loring. "How much?" he demanded.  "A twentieth of the take," said Shinny. "And that's dirt cheap."  "It's robbery," said Loring, "but O.K. We've got no choice!"  "Loring, wait a minute!" objected Mason. "One twentieth! Why, that could add up to a million credits!"  Shinny's eyes opened wide. "Twenty million! Hey, there hasn't been a uranium strike that big since the old seventeenth moon of Jupiter back in 2294!"  Loring motioned to them to sit down at a table. He ordered a bottle of rocket juice and filled three glasses.  "This ain't uranium, _Mr._ Shinny!" he said.  Shinny's eyes opened wider still. "What then?"  "What's the most precious metal in the system today?" Loring asked.  "Why--gold, I guess."  "Next to gold?"  Shinny thought for a moment. "Couldn't be silver any more, since they're making the artificial stuff cheaper'n it costs to mine it." The little man's jaw dropped and he stared at Loring. "You mean--?"  "That's right," said Loring, "copper!"  Shinny's mind raced. In this year of 2353, all major copper deposits had long since been exhausted and only small new deposits were being found, not nearly enough for the needs of the expanding system. In an age of electronics, lack of copper had become a serious bottleneck in the production of electrical and scientific equipment. Search parties were out constantly, all over the solar system, trying to find more of the precious stuff. So a deposit of the kind Loring and Mason were talking about was a prize indeed.  Shinny's greedy fingers twitched with anticipation.  "So that's why you want to buy a spaceship, eh?"  "Wanted," replied Loring. "I don't want to buy one now. The way things look, we'll get what we want for nothing!"  Mason, who had been sitting quietly, suddenly jumped up. "So that's your angle! Well, I don't want any part of it," he shouted.  Loring and Shinny looked up in surprise.  "What're you talking about?" demanded Loring.  "All of a sudden it's come to me. Now I know why you've been hanging around the spaceport for the last two weeks. And what you meant when you saw the spaceman get out of that freighter today!"  "Sit down!" barked Loring. "If you weren't so dumb, you'd have caught on long ago." He eyed the shorter man from between half-closed lids. "It's the only way we can get out of here!"  "Not me. I ain't pulling anything like that!" whined Mason.  "What's going on here?" demanded Shinny. "What're you two space bums talking about?"  "I'll tell you what! He's going to try--"  Loring suddenly stood up and slapped the shorter spaceman across the mouth. Mason sat down, a dazed look on his face.  "You space-crawling rat!" hissed Loring. "You'll do what I tell you to do, see?"  "Yeah--yeah, sure," bleated Mason. "O.K. Anything you say. Anything."  "What is this?" demanded Shinny.  "You shut up!" growled Loring.  "I won't!" said Shinny, as he also rose from the table. "You may be tough, Billy Loring, but not as tough as me!"  The two men stared at each other for a moment. Finally Loring smiled and patted Mason's shoulder. "Sorry, Al. I guess I got a little hot for a moment."  "Quit talking riddles," pleaded Shinny. "What's this all about?"  "Sit down," said Loring.  They sank back into their chairs.  "It's simple," said Mason fearfully. "Loring wants to steal a spaceship."  "A pirate job!" said Shinny. He drew in his breath sharply. "You must be outta your mind!"  "You've called yourself in on this," Loring reminded him. "And you're staying in."  "Oh, no!" Shinny's voice dropped to a husky, frightened whisper. "Deal's off. I ain't gonna spend the rest of my life on a prison asteroid!"  "Shinny, you know too much!" Loring's hand darted toward the blaster he wore at his belt.  "Your secret's safe with me. I give you my spaceman's word on it," said Shinny, pushing back his chair. Abruptly getting to his feet, he scrambled rapidly out the door of the Cafe Cosmos.  "Loring," said Mason, "get him. You can't let him ..."  "Forget it," shot back the other. "He won't break his spaceman's oath. Not Shinny." He got up. "Come on, Mason. We haven't got much time before the _Annie Jones_ blasts off."  "What are we gonna do?" the shorter man wanted to know.  "Stow away on the cargo deck. Then, when we get out into space, we dump the pilots and head for Tara, for our first load of copper."  "But a job like this'll take money!"  "We'll make enough to go ahead on the first load."  Mason began to get up, hesitated, and then sat down again.  "Come on," snapped Loring. His hand dropped toward his belt. "I'm going to make you rich, Mason," he said quietly. "I'm going to make you one of the richest men in the universe--even if I have to kill you first."  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 7   "Space freighter _Antares_ from Venus space station. Your approach course is one-nine-seven--corrected. Reduce speed to minimum thrust and approach spaceport nine--landing-deck three. End transmission!"  Tom stood on the dais of the traffic-control room and switched the _Antares_ beam to one of his assistants at the monitors in the control room. In less than two weeks he had mastered the difficult traffic-control procedure to the point where Captain Stefens had allowed him to handle the midnight shift. He checked the monitors and turned to see Roger walk through the door.  "Working hard, Junior?" asked Roger in his casual drawl.  "Roger!" exclaimed Tom. "What are you fooling around down here for?"  "Ah, there's nothing to do on the radar deck. Besides, I've got the emergency alarm on." He wiped his forehead. "Brother! Of all the crummy places to be stuck!"  "Could be worse," said Tom, his eyes sweeping the monitors.  "Nothing could be worse," groaned Roger. "But nothing. Think of that lovely space doll Helen Ashton alone on earth--and me stuck here on a space station."  "Well, we're doing an important job, Roger," replied Tom. "And doing it well, or Major Connel wouldn't leave us alone so much. How're you making out with the new equipment?"  "That toy?" sneered Roger. "I gave it a look, checked the circuits once, and knew it inside out. It's so simple a child could have built one!"  "Oh, sure," scoffed Tom. "That's why the top scientists worked for years on something small, compact, powerful enough to reach through deep space--and still be easy to repair."  "Quit heckling me, Junior," retorted Roger, "I'm thinking. Trying to figure out some way of getting to the teleceiver set on board the _Polaris_."  "Why can't you get on the _Polaris_?" asked Tom.  "They're jazzing up the power deck with a new hyperdrive unit for the big hop to Tara. So many guys buzzing around you can't get near it."  "What do you need a teleceiver for?" asked Tom.  "To give me company," replied Roger sourly. "Say!" He snapped his fingers suddenly. "Maybe if I just changed the frequency--"  "What frequency? What are you talking about?"  "Spaceboy, I'm getting a real hot-rocket idea! See ya later!" And the blond cadet ran for the door.  Tom watched his unit-mate disappear and shook his head in amused despair. Roger, he told himself, might be difficult, but he was certainly never dull.  Then his attention was brought back to the monitors by the warning of another approaching spaceship.  "... jet liner _San Francisco_ to Venus space-station traffic control ..." the metallic voice crackled over the speaker.  "Jet liner _San Francisco_, this is Venus space-station traffic control," replied Tom. "You are cleared for landing at port eleven--repeat--eleven. Make standard check for approach orbit to station landing. End transmission!"  From one side of the circular dais, Tom saw Major Connel enter the room. He snapped to attention and saluted smartly.  "Morning, Corbett," said Connel, returning Tom's salute. "Getting into the swing of the operation?"  "Yes, sir," said Tom. "I've handled about twenty approaches since Captain Stefens left me alone, and about fifty departures." Tom brought his fist up, with the thumb extended and wiped it across his chest in the traditional spaceman's signal that all was clear. "I didn't scratch one of 'em, sir," he said, smiling.  "Good enough," said Connel. "Keep it that way." He watched the monitor screen as the liner _San Francisco_ settled into landing-port eleven.  When she was cradled and secure, he grunted his satisfaction and turned to leave. At the door he suddenly paused. "By the way, isn't Manning on radar watch?"  "Yes, sir," replied Tom.  "Well, it's one forty-eight. How about his standard check-in with traffic control?"  Tom stammered, "He--uh--he may be plotting some space junk, sir."  "He _still_ must report, regardless of what he's doing!"  "I--uh--ah--yes, sir!" gulped Tom. Blast Roger anyway, he thought, forgetting the all-important quarter-hour check-in.  "I'd better go up and find out if anything's wrong," said Connel.  "Gosh, sir," suggested Tom, desperately seeking an excuse for his shipmate. "I'm sure Roger would have notified us if anything had happened."  "Knowing Manning as I do, I'm not so sure!" And the irascible officer thundered through the door like a jet-propelled tank!   "Come on, Mason. Hurry and put on that space suit," barked Loring.  "Take it easy," grumbled Mason. "I'm working as fast as I can!"  "Of all the rotten luck," growled Loring. "Who'd ever figure the _Annie Jones_ would blast off from Venus--and then stop at the space station!"  "Shows you ain't so smart," retorted Mason. "Lots of ships do that. They carry just enough fuel to get 'em off the surface, so they'll be light while they're blasting out of Venus' gravity. Then they stop at the space station to refuel for the long haul."  "All right," barked Loring, "lay off the lecture! Just get that space suit on in a hurry!"  "Listen, wise guy," challenged Mason, "just tell me one thing. If we bail out of this tub in space suits, who's going to pick us up?"  "We're not bailing out!" said Loring.  "We're not? Then what are we suiting up for?"  "Just in case," said Loring. "Now listen to me. In a few minutes the _Annie Jones_'ll make contact with traffic control. Only instead of talking to the pilot--they'll be talking to us. Because we'll have taken over."  "But unless we land they'll be suspicious. And if we land ..."  Loring interrupted. "Nobody's going to suspect a thing. I'll tell traffic control we've got an extra-heavy load. Then they won't let us land. We follow their orders and blast off into space--find an emergency fuel station--head for Tara--and nobody suspects anything."  Mason twisted his face into a scowl. "Sounds awful risky to me," he muttered.  "Sure it's risky," sneered Loring, "but you don't hit the jackpot without ever taking a _chance_!"  The two men, huddled against a jumble of packing cases in the cargo hold of the _Annie Jones_, made careful preparations. Checking their weapons, they opened their way toward the freighter's control deck. Just outside the hatch they stopped, paralo-ray guns ready, and listened.  Inside, Pilot James Jardine and Leland Bangs, his first officer, were preparing for the landing at the space station.  "Ought to be picking up the approach radar signal pretty soon," said Bangs. "Better take her off automatic control, Jardine. Use the manual for close maneuvering."  "Right," answered his spacemate. "Send out a radar blip for them to pick up. I'll check the cargo and make sure it's lashed down for landing. Captain Stefens is tough when it comes to being shipshape."  The freighter blasted evenly, smoothly onward through the darkness of space in a straight line for the man-made satellite. Jardine got up from the freighter's dual-control board, picked up a portable light, and headed for the hatch leading to the cargo deck.  "He's coming," hissed Loring. "We'll take him soon's he reaches us." There was a sharp clank as the hatch opened, and Jardine's head came into view.  "Now!" yelled Loring. He swung the heavy paralo-ray gun at Jardine's head.  "What the--" exclaimed the startled spaceman. "Bangs, look out!"  He tried to avoid the blow, but Loring's gun landed on the side of his head. Jardine crumpled to the deck.  Bangs was out of his seat in a moment, at his pilot's call. The burly redheaded spaceman saw at a glance what was wrong and lunged for the hatch.  Loring stepped toward him, holding his paralo-ray.  "All right, spaceboy!" he grated. "Hold it or I'll freeze you stiff!"  Bangs stopped and stared at the gun and at Jardine who was slumped on the deck. Mason rushed past him to the controls.  "What is this?" demanded Bangs.  "An old game," explained Loring with a sneer. "It's called 'You've got it and I take it.' And if you don't like it, you get it." He gestured with his gun. "You get it--with this."  Bangs nodded. "O.K.," he said. "O.K. But how about letting me take care of my buddy. He's hurt."  [Illustration]  "Just a bump on the head," said Loring. "He'll come out of it soon enough."  "Hey," shouted Mason, "I can't figure out these controls!"  Loring growled angrily. "Here, lemme at them!" He forced Bangs to lie down on the deck, and then, keeping the gun trained on the redheaded spaceman, stepped quickly to the control board. He handed Mason the gun.  "Keep an eye on them while I figure this baby out."  "Least you coulda done is steal a decent ship," grumbled Mason. "This tub is so old it creaks!"  "Just shut your mouth and keep your eye on those guys," said the other. He began to mutter to himself as he tried to figure out the complicated controls.  [Illustration]  Jardine was now conscious but had the presence of mind not to move. His head ached from the blow. Slowly he opened his eyes and saw his two attackers bending over the board. He saw that Bangs was lying on the deck facing him. Jardine winked at Bangs, who returned the signal. Then he began, carefully, methodically to send a Morse-code message to his companion via his winking eyes.  "O-N-L-Y--one--gun--between--them. You--take--big--fellow. I'll--charge--gun ..."  "Can't you figure this thing out either?" asked Mason, leaning over Loring's shoulder.  "Ah, this wagon is an old converted chemical burner. These controls are old as the sun. I've got to find the automatic pilot!"  "Try that lever over there," suggested Mason.  Loring reached over to grasp it, turning away from his prisoners.  "Bangs, get 'em!" shouted Jardine. The two men jumped to their feet and lunged at Loring and Mason. Loring dove to one side, losing the gun in the scramble, but as he fell, he reached for the acceleration control lever. He wrenched it out of its socket and brought it down on Bang's head, and the officer slid to the floor. Jardine, meanwhile, had Mason in a viselike grip, but again Loring used the lever, bringing it down hard on the neck of the freighter pilot. Jardine dropped to the deck.  "Thanks, Loring," gasped Mason. "That was close! Good thing we had on these space suits, or we'd have been finished. They couldn't grab onto the smooth plastic."  "Finished is right!" snarled Loring. "I told you to keep an eye on them! If they'd nabbed us we woulda wound up on the prison asteroid!"  "Loring," shouted Mason, "look!" He pointed a trembling finger at the thrust indicator. "We're blasting at full space speed--right for the station!"  "By the rings of Saturn," cried Loring, "I must've jammed the thrust when I yanked the lever out of the control board!"  "Put it back! Slow this ship down!" cried Mason, his face ashen with fear. Loring jumped to the control board and with trembling fingers tried to replace the lever in the socket.  "I can't--can't--" he panted. "We gotta pile outta here! We're heading for the station. We'll crash!"  "Come on! This way! We left the space helmets back in the cargo hold!" shouted Mason. He ran toward the open hatch leading to the companionway. Suddenly he stopped. "Hey, what about those two guys?"  "Never mind them!" shouted Loring. "Keep going. We can't do anything for them now!"  And as the two men raced toward the stern, the freighter, her powerful rockets wide open, arrowed straight toward the gleaming white structure of the space station.   "It was easy, honey," cooed Roger into the microphone on the main control panel of the space-station radar bridge.  "I switched the frequency on the station, beamed to a teleceiver trunk line on Earth, and called you up, my little space pet! Smart, huh? Now remember we have a date as soon as I get back from this important and secret mission. I could've got out of it, but they needed me badly. As much as I like you, baby, I had to go along to give the boys a break and ..."  "_Cadet Manning!_" An infuriated roar echoed in the small chamber.  "Yeah, whaddaya wan--" growled Roger, turning to see who had interrupted him. He suddenly gulped and turned pale. "Ohhhhhhhhh--good-by, baby!" He flipped the switch and stood up.  "Uh--ah--good morning, Major Connel," he stammered.  "What's going on here, Manning?" barked Connel.  "I--was--talking, sir," replied Roger.  "So I heard! But talking to whom?"  "To whom, sir?"  "That's what I said, Manning." Connel's voice dropped to a deep sarcastic purr. "To whom?"  "I was--ah--talking to Earth, sir."  "Official business, I presume?"  "You mean--official--like here on the station, sir?"  "Official, like here on the station, Manning," replied Connel in almost a kindly tone.  "No, sir."  "You failed to make your quarter-hour check to the traffic-control center, I believe?"  "Yes, sir," gulped Roger. The full realization of what he had done was beginning to dawn on him.  "And you've tampered with vital station equipment for your own personal use," added Connel. With a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach, Roger noticed the major was strangely quiet in his interrogation. It felt like the calm before the storm.  "Yes, sir," admitted Roger, "I changed several circuits."  "Are you aware of the seriousness of your negligence, Manning?" Connel's voice began to harden.  "Yes--yes--I guess so, sir," stumbled Roger.  "Can you repair that radar so that it can be used as it was intended?"  "Yes, sir."  "Then do so immediately. There are ships in flight depending on your information and signals."  "Yes, sir," said Roger quietly. Then he added quickly, "I'd like the major to know, sir, that this is the first time this has happened."  "I have only your word for that, Manning!" Connel finally began blasting in his all too familiar roar. "Since you've done it once, I see no reason to think you couldn't have done it before or that you might not do it again!" The officer's face was now almost purple with rage. "When you've repaired that set, return to your quarters! You are confined until I decide on disciplinary action!"  Turning abruptly, Connel stormed out of the room, slamming the hatch closed behind him.  With a sigh Roger turned back to the set. With trembling fingers he reconnected the terminals and made delicate adjustments on the many dials. Finally, as power began to flow through the proper chain of circuits, the radar scanner glowed into life and the hair-thin line of light swept around the dull green surface of the scope. It had been left on a setting covering two hundred miles around the space station, and seeing the area was clear, Roger increased the range to five hundred miles. The resulting scan sent a sudden chill down his spine. A spaceship was roaring toward the station at full thrust!  Cold sweat beaded Roger's forehead as he grabbed for the microphone and called Tom.  "Radar bridge to control deck!" The words tumbled out frantically. "Tom! Tom! There's a ship heading right for the station! Bearing 098! Distance 450 miles! Coming in on full thrust! Tom, acknowledge! Quick!"  Down on the control deck, Tom had been watching a space freighter easing out of the station when Roger's voice came over the speaker in a thin scream.  "What?" he yelled. "Give me that again, Roger!"  "Spaceship bearing 098--full thrust! Range now four twenty-five!"  "By the craters of Luna," shouted Tom, "why didn't you pick her up sooner, Roger?"  "Never mind that. Contact that guy and tell him to change course! He can't brake in time now!"  "All right! Sign off!" Without waiting for a reply, Tom cut Roger off and switched to a standard space band. His voice quivering, the young cadet spoke quickly and urgently into the microphone. "Space station to spaceship approaching on orbit 098. Change course! Emergency! Reduce thrust and change course or you will crash into us!"  As he spoke, Tom watched the master screen of his scanner and saw the ship rocketing closer and closer with no change in speed or course. He realized that any action, even now, would bring the craft dangerously close to the station. Without hesitation, he flipped on the master switch of the central station communicator, opening every loud-speaker on the station to his voice.  "Attention! Attention! This is traffic-control center! Emergency! Repeat. Emergency! All personnel in and near landing ports five, six, seven, eight, and nine--decks A, B, and C--evacuate immediately to opposite side of the station. Emergency crews stand by for crash! Spaceship heading for station! May crash! Emergency--emergency!"  On the endangered decks, men began to move quickly, and in a moment the great man-made satellite was prepared for disaster. On the control deck, Tom stayed at his station, sounding the warning.  "Emergency! Emergency! All personnel prepare for crash! All personnel prepare for crash!"  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 8   "There--there!" shouted Captain Stefens into the mike aboard the jet boat circling around the station. "I think I see something bearing about seventy degrees to my left and up about twenty on the ecliptic! Do you see it, Scotty?"  Tom, in the bucket seat of the jet boat, strained his eyes but was unable to see over the control board.  Terry Scott, in a second jet boat ten miles away, answered quickly, "Yes, I think I see it, sir."  "Good!" shouted Stefens. "Maybe we've found something."  He spoke to Tom over his shoulder, keeping his eye on the floating objects in the black void of space. "Come to the starboard about one-quarter full turn, Corbett, and hold it. Then up, about twenty-five degrees."  "Aye, aye, sir," said Tom. He began to maneuver the small gnat-sized space craft to the proper position.  "That's good!" shouted Stefens. "Now hold that. Let me see. I think we've hit pay dirt."  From the right, Tom could see the red flash of the rockets of Terry Scott's jet boat, which Astro had volunteered to pilot, coming into view. As soon as order had been restored aboard the station, search parties had been sent out to look for survivors.  Carefully Tom slowed the space craft in response to Stefens' brief commands and soon came to a dead halt in space. There, hovering right above them, visible through the crystal dome of the jet boat, Tom could see two space-suited figures floating effortlessly. A moment later Scott's craft came alongside, and the two small ships were lashed together with magnetic lines. Tom and Stefens hurriedly pulled on their space helmets. They adjusted the valves regulating the oxygen supply in their suits, and Stefens slipped back the sliding top of the jet boat. Out on the hull he secured a line to a projecting ring, and ordering Tom to stand by, he pushed himself off the ship into the bottomless void of space.  The line trailing behind him, Stefens drifted toward the two helpless figures. He reached them in less than a minute, secured the line to their belts, and signaled Tom to haul in.  Near by, Terry Scott and Astro watched as the three figures were pulled to safety.  Quickly the top of the jet boat was closed, oxygen pressure in the craft was restored, and the four men took off their helmets.  "Whew!" said Loring. "I sure want to thank you for pulling us out of the deep!"  "We sure do, sir!" added Mason. Then, with a quick look at Loring, he asked softly, "Were there any other survivors?"  Stefens' face was grim. "Not one. After we untangled the mess, we found bodies of two men. It was pretty bad. A little later something was spotted on the radar, and we hoped there might be survivors. Luckily for you, we came to look!"  [Illustration: _Tom could see two space-suited figures floating effortlessly_]  "By the rings of Saturn," swore Loring softly, "Jardine and Bangs were brave men. They practically forced us to pile out when they saw they were going to crack up." He turned to Mason. "Didn't they, Al?"  "Yeah, yeah, sure brave men," Al Mason agreed.  "Nothing to be done for them now, of course," said Stefens. "What happened?" He paused, and then added, "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to before you make out your report, but I'd sure like to know."  "I don't really know what happened, sir," said Loring. "We had made a deal for a ride back to Earth with Jardine and were sleeping back on the cargo deck. All of a sudden, Jardine came running in. Told us we were about to pile into the station and for us to suit up and get out. We asked him about himself, but he said he was going to stay and try to save the ship. We piled out, and--well, we saw the whole thing from out here. Like a big splash of light. It must have been pretty bad on the station, eh?"  "Plenty bad, but thanks to Cadet Corbett here, there wasn't a single injury. He warned everybody to get off that side of the station. A lot of damage but no casualties."  "Don't you have any idea what made the ship crash?" asked Tom quietly.  Loring looked at Tom but spoke to Stefens. "I told you all I know, sir. Can I expect to be questioned by everyone in the Solar Guard. Including cadets?"  Stefens bristled. "It was a civil question, Loring," he said stiffly, "but you don't have to say anything if you don't want to!"  Loring and Mason had not expected such a strong defense of the cadet, and Loring was quick to make amends. "I'm sorry--I guess I'm still a bit shaken up," he muttered.  Stefens grunted.  "It wasn't pretty, you know, watching that ship go up and not be able to do anything about it," Loring continued plaintively. "Jardine and Bangs--well, they're--they _were_ sorta friends of mine."  They were silent all the way back to the station, each with his own thoughts--Stefens puzzling over the cause of the crash, Loring and Mason exchanging quick furtive glances and wondering how long their story would hold up, and Tom wondering how much Roger's changing the power circuits on the radar had to do with the crash of the ship.   "That's right," snapped Connel to the two enlisted spacemen. "I said I wanted the radar section of the communications deck closed and sealed off until further investigations. You can hook up and use one of the monitors in the traffic control meantime."  The two red-clad spacemen turned and walked away. Stefens stood to one side.  "Don't you think that's carrying things a little too far, sir?" he asked Connel.  "I'm doing this as much to protect Cadet Manning as I am to prosecute him! I want to be sure there was no connection between the crash of the _Annie Jones_ and his tampering with the radar circuits!" Connel replied.  "I guess you're right, sir," replied Stefens. "Those two survivors, Loring and Mason, are having coffee in the mess if you want to talk to them."  "Did they change their story?" asked Connel.  "None at all. They were hooking a ride back to Atom City, and they were asleep in the cargo hold. Jardine, one of the pilots, came in and told them to pile out. They did."  "Ummmmh," mused Connel. "I know those two, Loring and Mason. Had a little trouble with them recently on a trip to Tara. Suspended their papers. So if they were just hooking a ride, it might be they're telling the truth!"  "I have a report here on the damage to the station, sir, if you'd like to listen to it," said Stefens, handing his superior a spool of audiotape.  "Good! Did you make out the report yourself?" asked Connel.  "Yes, sir. With the assistance of Terry Scott and Cadet Corbett."  "Good lad, that Corbett," said Connel and paused. "The whole unit is good! If it weren't for that hare-brained Manning, I'd say they had as bright a future in the Solar Guard as any unit I've seen!"  "I'll buy that, sir!" said Stefens with a smile. "That Corbett picked up traffic-control operations like a duck takes to water. And it's been a long time since Jenledge on the power deck raved about a cadet the way he does about Astro."  Connel smiled. He was reluctant to press for an investigation of the radar deck, knowing that if he did, it would mean a damaging black mark against Manning. But justice was justice, and Connel came closer to worshiping justice than anything else in space!  Connel placed the spool of tape in the audiograph and settled in a chair to listen. He didn't like the entire affair. He didn't like to think of losing a cadet of Manning's ability because of one stupid mistake. He had recommended a thorough investigation. There was no other way. If Manning was cleared of the responsibility for the crash, he was free, and it would not show up against his record. If he wasn't, however, then he'd have to pay. Yes, thought Connel to himself, as Stefens' voice began to crackle harshly on the audiograph, if Manning was guilty, then Manning would most certainly pay. Connel would see to that.   Deep in the heart of the space station, Loring and Mason were huddled over steaming cups of coffee whispering to each other cautiously.  "Want more coffee, Mason?" asked Loring.  "Who wants coffee when there's going to be a Solar Guard investigation?" whined Mason. "Suppose they find out something?"  "Relax, will ya?" muttered Loring reassuringly. "Connel doesn't suspect a thing. Besides, he has that cadet under arrest!"  "Yeah," argued Mason, "but you don't know those guys at Space Academy. All this honor stuff! It's not like a regular investigation. They don't stop digging until they dig up _real facts_! They'll find out we stowed away and ..."  Loring calmly added cream and sugar to his coffee. "They can't prove a thing. Jardine and Bangs are dead, and the ship's nothing but a pile of junk."  "They'll find out, I tell you, and now we've got murder on our hands!"  A door behind Mason suddenly opened and Stefens appeared.  "Shut up, you fool!" Loring hissed. He turned blandly to face Stefens. "Well, Captain, glad you came. I wanted to talk to you about getting us transportation back to Venusport."  "You'll have to wait for the jet liner from Earth," said Stefens. "See me in about two hours. Right now, I've got to make arrangements for the investigation of the crash."  "Sure, sir," said Loring. "Ah--say, Captain, what do you expect the investigation to turn up?"  "The true facts," replied Stefens. "Whether the crash was due to the negligence of Cadet Manning or something that happened on the ship."  "Then you really think the cadet may be responsible?" asked Loring softly.  "He admits to negligence, and the _Annie Jones_ is a lot of evidence," said Stefens with a shrug, and walked out.  "There's our answer!" said Loring triumphantly. "Come on!"  "Where are we going?" asked Mason.  "We're going to have a little talk with our fall guy!"   "Ahhh, sit down, Roger," said Astro. "Everything will be O.K."  "Yeah," agreed Tom. "You're just wearing out the deck and your nerves walking back and forth like that. Everything will be O.K." Tom tried hard to keep any apprehension out of his voice.  "Nothing will make those two guys on the spaceship O.K.," said Roger. He kicked viciously at a stool and sat down on the side of his bunk.  Since the crash, Roger had been confined to his quarters, with Tom and Astro bringing him his meals. Tom had watched his unit-mate grow more and more bitter over the turn of events and was afraid Roger would do something rash.  The central communicator over the door suddenly buzzed, and the three cadets waited for the announcement.  "... Cadets Corbett and Astro report to rocket cruiser _Polaris_ for indoctrination on hyperdrive--on the double--by order of Major Connel."  Tom and Astro got up. Astro found it hard to hide his eagerness to begin indoctrination on hyperdrive, and it was only his deep concern for Roger that kept him from letting out one of his bull-throated bellows.  "Take it easy, Roger," said Tom. "The investigation will be over and we'll be on our way to Tara before you know it."  "Yeah, you space Romeo," growled Astro, "crawl in the sack and rest your bones. You're lucky you can miss this."  Roger managed a weak smile. "I'll be O.K. Go ahead and learn about that hyperdrive before you explode."  There was an awkward moment while the three cadets stared at one another. The deep friendship between them didn't need to be expressed in words. Abruptly, Tom and Astro turned and left the room.  Roger stared at the closed door for a moment and then flopped on his bunk. He closed his eyes and tried to go to sleep. Whatever happened, he thought, it wouldn't do any good to knock himself out.  As he lay there thinking back to the first months at Space Academy when he had met Tom and Astro, he heard a knock on the door and he turned to see the steel hatch slide back stealthily. He jumped up.  Loring stuck his head inside the door. "You alone, Manning?" he asked.  "Yeah. Who're you?" asked Roger.  "My name's Loring, and this is my space buddy, Al Mason. We were on the _Annie Jones_."  Roger's eyes lighted up. "Then you know I'm not responsible for the crash!" said Roger.  "I wouldn't say that, kid," said Loring grimly. "I wouldn't say that at all."  "What do you mean?" demanded Roger.  "A shame"--Loring shook his head--"young fella like you winding up on the prison asteroid."  "Prison asteroid?" asked Roger stupidly.  "Yeah," grunted Loring. "Have you ever seen one of them joints, Manning? They work from noon to midnight. Then they give you synthetic food to eat, because it costs too much to haul up solid grub. Once you've been on the prison rock, you can't ever blast off again. You're washed up as a spaceman. Think you'll like that?"  "Why--why--what's that got to do with me?" asked Roger.  "Just this, kid. After the investigation they'll find out your radarscope wasn't working right. Then they'll come to me and ask me what happened aboard the _Annie Jones_."  "Well," demanded Roger, "what did happen?"  Loring glanced at Mason. "Just this, kid. Jardine and Bangs were on the teleceiver and the radar for fifteen minutes trying to pick up your beam. But there wasn't any, because you had it fouled up!"  Roger sat down on the side of the bunk and stared at the two men. If what they said was true, Roger knew there could only be one outcome to the investigation.  "Why are you telling me this?" asked Roger quietly.  "Very simple. I don't like to see _anyone_ go to the prison rock!"  "Are you"--Roger hesitated--"are you suggesting that I escape?"  Loring and Mason got up and walked to the door. Loring turned back to face Roger. "I'm not suggesting anything, Manning," he said. "You're a big boy and should know what's good for you. But"--he paused and measured his words carefully--"if I were you, I wouldn't wait around for Connel or anyone else to blast my life to pieces by sending me to a prison for one little mistake!"  The hatch slid closed behind the two spacemen.  Roger stood up and began packing a small spaceman's bag. There was a jet liner coming in from Atom City that would make a stop at Venusport. He glanced at his watch. Thirty minutes. He didn't have much time.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 9   "Attention! Attention! This is a general alert!" Tom Corbett's voice was hollow as he spoke over a solar-wide audiocast. "Wanted! Space Cadet Roger Manning. Five feet, eleven inches tall, one hundred sixty-five pounds. Blue eyes. Blond hair. Last seen wearing dress blues. Cadet Manning broke confinement to quarters on Venus space station and is believed to be heading back to Earth. He is wanted in connection with the crash of the space freighter _Annie Jones_ and the death of two spacemen. All information regarding the whereabouts of Manning should be forwarded to Captain Isaiah M. Patrick, Senior Security Officer, Solar Guard, Space Academy, Earth. This alert is to be transmitted to all local authorities."  Tom snapped the switch off and silently watched the glowing audio tubes darken. He turned to one side and saw Astro. The big Venusian was seated on a desk, slumped over, his head held in his massive hands.  "You know," said Astro slowly, "I could take that guy Manning and break him in two for running out!"  Tom didn't answer. When they had discovered that Roger was missing it had been a terrific blow. Unaware that Roger, in his confused state of mind, had been an easy victim to Loring and Mason's trickery and had innocently walked into their trap, the two cadets felt that his escape was a breach of trust. Roger had given his spaceman's word that he would confine himself to his quarters. Roger had broken that trust, and now the fact was being flashed around the entire solar system; Roger Manning was an escaped criminal!  "There's nothing we can do now," said Tom. "The whole universe knows it. He's finished! Washed up! The only thing that could save him now would be absolute clearance by the investigation. But since he's run out, I guess it must be the other way around. He was afraid he was going to get caught." Tom's voice was cold and bitter. "And we can't blame anyone but--"  "_But Manning!_" barked a voice behind them. Astro jumped up and snapped to attention. Tom turned to see Major Connel stride into the room. It was at Connel's insistence that Tom had been ordered to broadcast the alert for Roger.  "That's the last time I ever want to hear any sympathy for a man who broke his word!" snarled Connel.  "I have something I'd like to say to the major," said Astro in a deliberate voice, "as man to man!"  Even at attention, Tom jerked his head involuntarily to look at Astro. Connel's eyes narrowed. "Here it comes," he thought. "Well, I've handled rebellion of this sort before." He stepped close to Astro. So close in fact that the black and gold of his uniform brushed the massive chest of the cadet from Venus.  "You have permission to speak, man to man!" snapped Connel.  Astro paused for a moment. Then he relaxed and brought his eyes down to the level of the major.  "I am a human being, sir," said Astro in the deepest voice Tom had ever heard. It was strong and full of emotion, yet controlled. "And as long as I am a human being, I shall consider Roger Manning one of the finest men I'll ever know."  "Are you finished?" snapped Connel.  "No, sir, I'm not," said Astro. "I speak in defense of the man, the _spaceman_, not the uniform, or the trust he betrayed. And I respectfully request of the major that if his feelings for Cadet Manning are so violent that he finds it difficult to control them, that he make a special effort to control them"--Astro paused and stuck out his chin--"in my presence!"  Connel stepped back. "And if I don't?" he shouted.  "Then I shall ask for a transfer from your command, sir, and if that is not granted, then I shall resign from the Academy."  "And?" asked Connel.  "And, sir--" Astro stumbled.  "_And what_, Cadet Astro?" roared Connel.  "I have nothing more to say, sir," said Astro.  Tom, who had at first had to control an impulse to laugh at the strange seriousness of Astro's manner and tone, now found it equally difficult to hold back the tears that were welling up in his eyes.  Connel was not going to let the incident stand there. He had secretly hoped that such a situation would present itself, because he wanted to see what material the _Polaris_ unit was made of. And he was secretly satisfied. Any cadet who would offer to resign from the Academy in defense of his unit-mate was a true spaceman. Connel wasn't going to allow Astro or Tom to resign over some foolish trick of Roger's, but, at the same time, he couldn't allow them to take too many liberties with discipline. Connel turned to Tom.  "I suppose you feel the same way, Corbett?" he asked.  "I do, sir," said Tom.  "Of course you know I could make your lives miserable now," he threatened.  "We are aware of that, sir," said Tom quietly.  "Very well, Cadets Corbett and Astro. I shall comply with your request. Not because of your request but out of respect for your feelings as spacemen. I wouldn't have thought much of you if you hadn't come out in defense of Manning. And just for your own sake, Astro," said Connel, stepping back in front of the big cadet, "never ask to talk to a Solar Guard officer man to man again. As long as you're still a member of the Cadet Corps such disrespect will not be tolerated. Another man, who might not have understood your feelings, could have used your desire for fair play as a means of trapping you into one of the worst offenses in the Spaceman's Code--striking a Solar Guard officer!"  "Yes, sir," mumbled Astro. "Thank you, sir."  "Report aboard the _Polaris_"--Connel glanced at his watch--"in fifteen minutes. I'm going to put you through your paces on hyperdrive and the operation of the transmitter."  "Then we're still going to make the trip to Tara, sir?" asked Tom.  "We certainly are, Corbett," replied Connel. "In two hours another cadet is arriving from the Academy to replace Roger. His name's Alfie Higgins. Perhaps you know him."  Tom smiled. "Yes, sir, we know him," he replied. "Cadet Higgins is a friend of mine. He carries the nickname of 'The Brain.' Has the highest I.Q. in the Academy."  "Good. I'm glad you know him, because this is going to be a rough trip. We got off to a bad start, but it's all over now. So forget it. And before I go, I want you to know this. In my personal opinion, Manning had nothing to do with the crash. I think the whole trouble was caused on the ship. I have nothing to back up my opinion, except my feelings. But feelings can go a long way in making a man innocent until proved guilty. Unit dis-missed!"   Alfie Higgins listened attentively to the story of the crash and Roger's disappearance as Tom, and then Astro, described the situation in detail.  "It is a pity, of course, but Manning was always the impulsive type. Not very definite in his attitude and emotionally unstable," commented Alfie when the story was finished.  "Lay off that talk, you overstuffed brain!" growled Astro. "In this outfit, Roger is just away on vacation!"  "Yes--yes, of course!" said Alfie quickly. It wasn't wise to get off on the wrong foot in a new unit, especially when one was trying to fill the shoes of a cadet, who, Alfie had to admit, had everything. Alfie Higgins' mother didn't raise any stupid children, he said to himself. He was too happy being a member of the _Polaris_ unit, the hottest crew at the Academy, to allow anything to interfere with his success.  "I've heard a great deal about hyperdrive," he said quickly, changing the subject. "I would appreciate it if you could describe the basis of this new feature in space travel so that I may have at least a surface familiarity with its operation and application."  Astro gulped and looked at Tom. "Might as well get used to that kind of chatter, Astro," said Tom, smiling. "Alfie can't talk any other way."  "Is there something wrong with the way I speak?" asked Alfie, wrinkling up his nose a little to see through the thick lenses of his glasses.  "You wanta know about hyperdrive?" growled Astro.  "To be sure, if you'd be so kind," said Alfie.  "Well, if you'll close your trap long enough, I'll tell you about it!"  Alfie sat back and waited, hands clasped around one knee.  "In the first place," began Astro, "hyperdrive was developed by Joan Dale back at the Academy. And it's so blasted simple, I get mad at myself for not thinking of it first!"  "Uhhh," snorted Alfie. "I respect your great talent on the power deck, Astro, but I would hardly compare myself with Dale!"  "Shut up!" barked Astro. "You'll see how simple it is! Hyperdrive is based on the idea that the thrust of the rockets acts in the exact same way on _all_ the atoms inside the spaceship. So you can have as much thrust as you want and no one will feel a thing. Even if the ship were to accelerate a million times faster than the gravity of the Earth you wouldn't feel a thing, because all the atoms inside would be pushed along at the same time!" Astro sat back triumphantly.  "Ummmmh," commented Alfie. "That sounds all right as a principle, but will it work out in space?"  "Listen, you--you--" snorted Astro.  "Sure it will, Alfie," said Tom. "It's been tested before."  "Still room for improvement, though," commented Alfie.  "I'll improve your head," barked Astro, "if you don't close that big mouth! How do you like that, Tom? We get rid of one space-gassing Romeo and now we get one even worse!"  Astro's reference to Roger made Tom draw a quick breath. In the short while since Alfie's arrival and the week since Roger's disappearance there hadn't been time to forget their old unit-mate and get accustomed to a new personality. Astro sensed Tom's feelings and irritably banged one hamlike fist into the other. Alfie was O.K., thought the big Venusian, but by the craters of Luna, he wasn't Roger.  "Attention--attention!" The intercom crackled into life. "_Polaris_ unit--by order of Major Connel--stand by to blast off immediately. This is first warning! Pack your gear and stand by to blast off immediately."  Tom, Astro, and Alfie got up, and with the image of Roger fresh in their minds, made their way to the landing-port deck where the great gleaming spaceship was slung on magnetic cradles. They were met at the hatch by Major Connel.  "All right," he said, "we leave all thoughts of Manning right here on the station. I know it's tough, but we've got a still tougher job to do. This is to be a scientific expedition and we'll need every ounce of energy and intelligence we have--_collectively_--to make a success of this mission. Cadet Corbett!"  "Yes, sir," replied Tom.  "Stand by to blast off in five minutes!"     CHAPTER 10   "Can I speak with you a minute, spaceman?"  Roger turned from the automatic food dispenser and stared at a wizened little man standing beside him, grinning up at him toothlessly.  "What do you want?" asked Roger.  "Just talk. Let's sit down at this table, eh?" said the little man, taking the cadet by the arm. "Gotta little deal I think you might be interested in."  Roger cast a quick appraising glance over the shabbily dressed man and walked to the table. Unless someone knew Roger personally, it would have been hard to recognize him. No longer wearing the vivid blue of the senior Space Cadet, he was now dressed in black trousers fitting snugly around the legs, a midnight blue pull-over jersey, and the black-billed hat of the merchant spaceman. His once close-cropped blond hair was beginning to grow shaggy around the edges, and with the hat pulled low over his forehead, he might have been another person entirely.  Leaving the space station on the jet liner had been easy for Roger, since no one suspected he would violate his trust. But once his absence was discovered and the warrant issued for his arrest, it had been necessary for him to assume some sort of disguise to elude the Solar Guard MP's. Roger had wound up on Spaceman's Row in Venusport as a matter of course. Luckily, when he left the station, he had the foresight to take all of his money with him, so he was not yet in need.  On Spaceman's Row, Roger found the new freedom from discipline enjoyable at first, but now the novelty had worn off. Having visited all of the interesting places on the Row, existence there had become boring. His one attempt to leave Spaceman's Row had nearly met with disaster. Running into a squad of Solar Guard MP's, he had made a hurried escape into a near-by jet taxi. Back on the Row, Roger had lounged around the cafes, feeling the loneliness that haunts men wanted by the law. And only because he was so lonely he had agreed to talk to the little man who sat and stared at him from across the table.  "You a rocket pusher, astrogator, or skipper?" asked the little man.  "Who wants to know?" asked Roger cautiously.  "Look, sonny boy," was the quick retort. "I'm Mr. Shinny! I'm the fixer of Spaceman's Row. You want something, come to me and I'll get it for you. I don't care why you're here. That ain't none of my business. But the fact remains that you're here, and you don't come down here unless you're in trouble space deep!"  Roger looked at the little man more closely. "Suppose I am in something deep? What could you do for me?" he asked.  "What would you want done?" asked Shinny slyly.  "Well," said Roger casually, "I could use a set of papers."  "What happened to your own?"  "Solar Guard picked them up," answered Roger simply.  "For what?" asked Shinny.  "Taking ice cream away from the skipper's pet monkey!" snapped Roger.  Shinny threw back his head and laughed. "That's good--very good!" He wiped his mouth after spitting at a near-by cuspidor. He reached over and patted Roger on the arm. "You'll do, sonny! You'll do right well on the Row. Join me in a little acceleration sport?"  "What's that?" asked Roger.  "Rocket juice!" said Shinny. "Ain't you never heard of rocket juice?"  "I've heard about it," said Roger with a smile, "and I'm still here to talk about it because I never drank any of it." Roger liked the little man for some reason--he couldn't tell why. He had met several people on the Row since his arrival, but they had all wanted to know how many credits he had and where he was staying.  "I took a jolt of that stuff once in Luna City," said Roger. "I was ready to blast off without a rocket ship!"  Shinny laughed again. "Good lad! Well, you won't mind if I have just a little one?" He paused and wiped his lips. "On you, of course!"  "One"--Roger held up his finger--"on me, of course!"  "Hey, there!" yelled Shinny. "You, with the asteroid head! Gimme a short bucket of that juice and bring a bottle of Martian fizz along with it!" The bartender nodded, and Shinny turned back to Roger. "Martian fizz is nothing more than a little water with sugar in it," he explained.  "Yeah, I know," replied Roger. "What about those papers?"  "I'll talk to you, spaceman to spaceman," said Shinny, "when you're ready to talk to me, spaceman to spaceman!"  They were silent while the bartender slopped a glass full of bluish liquid in front of Shinny and the bottle of Martian fizz and a glass in front of Roger. Roger paid for the drinks and poured a glass of the mild sweet water. Sipping it silently, he suddenly put the glass down again and looked Shinny in the eye.  "You know who I am," he stated quietly.  "Yep!" replied Shinny. "You're Roger Manning, Space Cadet! Breach of honor and violation of the Spaceman's Oath. Escaped from the Venus space station on a jet liner. But one of the best men on a radar scanner and astrogation prism in the whole alliance!" Shinny related the information rapidly.  "He had known all the time," thought Roger. "He was testing me." Roger wondered why.  "What are you going to do about it?" questioned Roger, thinking about the one-thousand-credit reward, standard price offered by the Solar Guard for all wanted men.  "If I had wanted to, I could have bought the finest jet liner in space with money made on Solar Guard rewards," snapped Shinny. "We got our own spaceman's code here on the Row. It goes something like this. What a man wants to bring with him down here, he brings. What he don't bring, don't exist!"  Roger smiled and stuck out his hand. "All right, Mr. Shinny! I want a set of papers--space papers! Made out in any name, so that I can get out into space again. I don't care where I go or on what, or how long I'm gone. I just gotta blast off!"  "You want papers for the astrogation deck, or control, or as a power pusher?" asked Shinny.  Roger thought a moment. "Better make them for the control deck," he said.  "Credits," said Shinny. "You have any credits?"  "How much?" asked Roger.  "One hundred now," said Shinny, and then added, "and one hundred when I deliver."  "Guaranteed papers?"  "Positively!" snorted Shinny. "I don't sell things that ain't good! I'm an honest man!"  Roger reached inside his jersey and pulled out a small roll of crumpled credit notes. He counted off one hundred and handed them over to Shinny.  "When do I get the papers?" asked Roger.  "Tomorrow, same place, same time," answered Shinny.  "What's the name of this place?" asked Roger.  "Cafe Cosmos."  Roger picked up his glass of sweet water, raising it in a toast to the little man in front of him. "Until tomorrow, Mr. Shinny, when you come here with the papers, or I come looking for you with bare knuckles!"  "You don't scare me!" snapped Shinny. "I'll be here!"  Roger tilted his chair back and smiled his casual smile. "I know you'll be back, Mr. Shinny. You see, I really mean what I say. And more important, _you_ know I mean what I say!"  Shinny got up. "Tomorrow, same time, same place," he said, hurrying out the door.  Roger finished the bottle of Martian fizz, suddenly very depressed. He didn't really want the false papers. He just wanted to get away from the deadly humdrum existence on Spaceman's Row. He walked wearily back to his scrubby little bedroom to wait for night to come. He hated to go back to the room, because he knew he would think about Tom and Astro and the Space Academy. Now he couldn't allow himself to think about it any more. It was past. Finished.   "You got _who_?" asked Loring.  "I said I got the best astrogator in the deep for ya!" snapped Shinny.  Loring looked at Mason and then suddenly burst out laughing, dropping his head on the table.  "What's the matter with you?" demanded Shinny. "You got space fever or something?"  Mason, sitting quietly in the dirty hotel room, was grinning from ear to ear.  "So you got Manning for us, eh?" repeated Loring at last. "I wanta tell you something, Shinny. I was the one that got that kid to break outta that space station!"  "You what?" asked Shinny. The little spaceman had come to like the straightforwardness of Roger.  "That's right," said Loring. "When Mason and me loused up taking over the _Annie Jones_, that kid, Manning, was on the radar watch at the station. At the same time we were gonna crash into the station he crossed a coupla wires and was talking to his girl back on Earth! They think _he_ fouled up the radar and caused the crash!"  "Then he's your fall guy," commented Shinny thoughtfully.  "Right," said Loring. "And now you come along and tell us that we can get him to astrogate us out to Tara! I tell ya, Mason, this is the greatest gag I've heard in years!"  "Yeah," agreed Mason, his weak mouth still stretched in a stupid grin, "but you have to be careful he never finds out it was us that got him into all his trouble!"  "Leave that to me," said Loring. "He'll never know a thing. In fact, he'll thank us for getting him off the station and then giving him a chance to get back in space." He turned to Shinny. "You got the ship?"  "I told you before," said Shinny, "there ain't anything to be had."  "Well, we gotta have a ship," said Loring. "A fortune waiting for us in the deep and no space wagon to go get it!"  "There _is_ a ship," said Shinny. "Not too good, but a spaceship."  "Where?" asked Loring.  "Near Venusport. Out in the jungles, to be exact. Needs a little fixing, but it'll make a deep space hop well enough."  "Who does it belong to?" demanded Loring.  "Me," said Shinny, a strange twinkle in his eyes.  "_You?_" gasped Loring. "By the craters of Luna, where did you get a spaceship?"  "Fifteen years ago a freighter was forced down in the jungles right near Venusport," said Shinny. "I was prospecting near by for pitchblende, back when everybody thought Venus was loaded with it. I saw the crew leave in jet boats. Soon as they was out of sight I went over to take a look. I wanted to see if there was any grub I could swipe and save myself a trip back to Venusport for more supplies. Anyway, I went aboard and found the grub all right, but I got nosy about why they had made an emergency touchdown. I looked around the power deck and found they had busted their reaction timer. I got the idea then of fixing it up and bringing it back to Venusport to give them young jerks a surprise. I lifted her off the ground and then figured why should I give it back? Just move it someplace else and let the vines and creepers grow over it for a few days."  "Didn't the crew come back looking for it?" asked Loring.  "Did they?" chortled Shinny. "I'll say they did! Almost drove them poor fellers crazy. I guess they searched for that old wagon for three months before giving up."  "And--and you mean it's still there--and in good condition?" asked Loring.  "Needs a little fuel," said Shinny, "and probably a good overhaul, but I don't think there's anything serious the matter with it."  "By the craters of Luna," exclaimed Loring, "we'll blast off immediately!"  "Hold on," said Shinny. "I didn't say I'd give it to you."  "Well, what do you want for it?" demanded Loring.  "Now let me see," mused Shinny. "I figure that if _you_ figure to get as much as twenty million credits out of the copper, a full quarter share ought to be about right."  "Five million credits for a--a ship that's been rotting in the jungle for fifteen years!" exclaimed Loring.  "She's in good shape," defended Shinny. "I go out there every six months or so and turn over the reactors just to keep 'em from getting rusty."  "Why didn't you try to do something with it before?" asked Loring.  "Never had no occasion to," answered Shinny. "Well, is it a deal, or isn't it?"  "Too much," snapped Loring.  "That's my price," said Shinny.  "I could take the ship and not give you anything," sneered Loring.  "If the Solar Guard looked for three months in that jungle, with a hundred men and instruments, do you think you'll find it?"  "I'll give you a fifth share," said Loring.  "Nope," said Shinny, "I've named my price. You either take it or leave it!" He glared at Loring.  Mason finally spoke. "Take it, Loring," he said, "and let's get out of here. I'm getting jittery over that investigation that's coming up on the station."  "All right," said Loring, "it's a deal. One quarter share for the ship."  "Done!" said Shinny--"Now I guess we'd better go talk to that boy Manning, eh?"  "Don't you think it'll be a little dangerous taking him along?" whined Mason.  "Yeah, maybe you're right," said Loring.  [Illustration]  "If it was me," said Shinny, "I wouldn't give it a second thought. You're going into _deep_ space. It ain't like a hop to Mars or Titan. This is as deep as you can go. If I was you, I'd want the best there is in my crew. And from what I've heard about that young feller, he's the best there is on the radar bridge. You know who his father was?"  "Who?" asked Mason.  "Ken--" Shinny suddenly closed his mouth tight. "Just another spaceman," he said, "but a good one!" He rose quickly. "Well, I'm supposed to meet Manning in an hour at the Cosmos."  [Illustration]  The three men left the dingy hotel and walked out into the main street of Spaceman's Row. In a few moments they arrived at the Cafe Cosmos. Roger was already there, seated at the same table and watching the door. When he saw Loring and Mason with Shinny, he eyed them warily.  "Hiya, kid!" greeted Loring. "Glad to see you took my advice and got away from 'Blast-off' Connel." Mason waved a salute, and the three men sat down.  Roger ignored Loring and Mason, speaking directly to Shinny. "Did you complete our deal?" he asked softly.  "Nope," answered Shinny. "I brought you another one instead."  Roger held out his hand. "My one hundred credits--_now!_"  "Never mind the credits, kid," said Loring, "we've got more important things to talk about."  Roger continued to look at Shinny, his palm outstretched on the top of the table. "One hundred credits," he repeated coldly.  Reluctantly, Shinny handed over the money. Slowly, carefully, Roger counted the bills, and then, after putting them away, he turned to face Loring for the first time.  "You said you have something important to discuss with me?" he drawled.  "I see you learned fast, kid!" said Loring with a crooked smile. "I wouldn't trust Shinny as far as I could throw a comet!"  Mason laughed loudly. The other three merely glared at him, and he stopped abruptly.  "Here's the proposition, Manning," said Loring, leaning across the table. "I've gotta ship and I wanta make a hop into deep space. I want you to do the astrogation!"  "I'm interested," said Roger. "Keep talking."  Briefly Loring described the copper satellite, its potential value, and what they expected to get out of it. Roger listened without comment. When Loring had finished, Shinny told him about the ship and its condition. When Shinny finished, Loring turned to Roger.  "Well, Manning," he asked, "how do you like the setup?"  "How much do I get out of it?" asked Roger.  "One twentieth of the take," said Loring.  "There are four of us. One full quarter-share, nothing less," drawled Roger.  "One-fourth to Shinny and one-fourth to him," whined Mason. "That only leaves us a fourth apiece!"  "That's more than you've got now," snapped Loring. "All right, Manning, you're in!"  Roger smiled for the first time. "When do we blast off?"  "As soon as we get that space wagon in shape we hit the deep!" said Loring.  "I think I need a drink on that," said Shinny. He yelled for the bartender, who brought rocket juice and Martian fizz.  Roger picked up the glass of the sweet water and glanced around the table.  "What's the name of that space wagon you've got buried in the jungles, Mr. Shinny?"  "Ain't got no name," said Shinny.  Roger paused, a slight smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Then I propose we name her after the hearts of each of us here at the table."  "What's that?" asked Loring.  "_Space Devil_," said Roger.  Shinny grinned, his frail body trembling slightly from his silent laughter. He held up the glass of rocket juice.  "I propose a toast to the _Space Devil_!"  "To the _Space Devil_," said the others together.  "And whatever trouble she brings," added Roger softly.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 11   "Cadet _Higgins_!" Major Connel's voice roared over the ship's intercom as the giant rocket cruiser _Polaris_ blasted smoothly through space.  "Yes, sir," squeaked Alfie in reply.  "Cadet Higgins," said Connel, "I thought I had requested a sight on the sun star Regulus at fifteen hundred hours!"  "You did, sir," replied Alfie.  "_Then why, by the craters of Luna, don't I have that position?_"  "I was--busy, sir," came the meek reply.  "Cadet Higgins," sighed Connel patiently, "would you be so kind as to come down to the control deck?"  In the short space of time since their departure from the space station Major Connel had learned that to scold Cadet Higgins was not the way to gain his attention. In fact, Major Connel had not been able to find a way of getting the little cadet's attention in any manner, at any time, on anything.  "I can't right now, sir," replied Alfie.  "What do you _mean_, you can't?" exploded Connel.  "I mean, sir," explained Alfie, "that I've just sighted Tara and I have to get a position check on her before we go any farther, to ensure that we traverse the same trajectory on our return trip and thus avoid the problem of finding a new and safe route back."  "Cadet Alfie Higgins"--Connel's voice climbed to a frenzied shriek--"if you are not on this control deck in ten seconds, I'll personally see that you are fed to a dinosaur when we touch down on Tara and you'll never return. _Now get down here!_"  Tom and Astro, who could hear the conversation over the intercom, were finding it very difficult to keep from laughing out loud at the innocence of Alfie and the outraged wrath of Major Connel.  Tom, particularly, had discovered that Alfie's innocent refusal to be bullied by Connel had made the time pass more quickly on the long haul through deep space. More than once he had seen Major Connel rage against the underweight cadet and become even more frustrated at his childlike resistance. It had helped Tom forget the empty feeling he experienced every time he called the radar deck and heard Alfie's mild voice instead of Roger's usual mocking answer. Astro, too, had managed to forget the loneliness he felt aboard the great cruiser by watching the antics of Alfie and Major Connel. More than once he had instigated situations where Alfie would get caught red-handed in a harmless error, and then he lay flat on the power deck, laughing until his sides ached, as he listened to Alfie and Major Connel over the intercom.  It had helped. Both Tom and Astro admitted it had helped, but it still didn't take away the dull ache each felt when an occasional remark, situation, or thought would bring Roger to mind.  Tom flipped the teleceiver on and waited for the blank screen to show him Tara. Connel stood to one side, also watching for the image of the planet to take form on the gray-black screen. A hatch clanked behind them, and Alfie stepped into the control deck to snap to his version of attention.  "Cadet Higgins reporting, sir," he said quietly.  Connel stepped in front of him, placed his hands on his hips, and bent slightly, pushing his face almost into Alfie's.  "Cadet Higgins, I want you to know I have taken all the blasted space-brained antics I'm going to take from you," said Connel quietly.  "Yes, sir," replied Alfie blandly.  "And," said Connel, shaking a finger in Alfie's face, "_and_ if there is one more--just _one_ more brazen, flagrant disregard of my _specific_ orders, then, Cadet Higgins, I promise you the most miserable trip back to Earth you will ever know in your entire career! I promise you I'll make you sweat! I'll--I'll--" Connel stopped short and shuddered. Alfie's owl-eyed look of innocence seemed to unnerve him. He tried to resume his tirade, but the words failed him. He finally turned away, growling, "Higgins, get up on that radar deck and do as you're told, _when_ you're told to do it and _not_ when you want to do it! Is that clear?"  "Yes, sir," said Alfie meekly. He saluted and returned to the radar deck.  "Corbett!" snapped Connel. "If I should appear to be losing control of myself when addressing Cadet Higgins, you have my official permission to restrain me. Use force if necessary!"  Tom bit his lip to keep from laughing and managed to mumble "Yes, sir." He turned quickly to the control board and began focusing on the planet lying dead ahead of the decelerating spaceship. They had been slowing down for several days, since their speed with the added hyperdrive had been increased greatly. The young cadet adjusted the last dial and the blue-green planet sprang into clear sharp focus on the screen.  "Why," gasped Tom. "Sir, look! It's just like Earth!"  "In more ways than one, Corbett," replied Connel. "What's our range?"  "I'd say we're close enough to reduce thrust to a quarter regular space speed, sir."  "Very well," said Connel. "Now look to the right on the screen. See that small dark patch over there in the middle of the planet?"  "Yes, sir," replied Tom.  "That's where we want to touch down," said Connel. "You stay here on the control deck and maneuver the ship closer in while I go to the radar deck and contact Space Academy on the transmitter. I've got to report that we expect to land soon."  "Very well, sir," said Tom. He turned and flipped the intercom switch. "Control deck to power deck," he said. "Check in, Astro."  "Power deck here," replied Astro. "What's up, Tom?"  "We just got our first good look at Tara. She's dead ahead. Major Connel's going to contact Space Academy, and I'm going to maneuver into our preliminary glide. Stand by for course changes."  "Make it an easy touchdown. I wanta get home, you know," replied Astro good-naturedly.  "O.K.," said Tom. "Better bring her down to one-quarter space speed."  "Hyper or regular?" asked Astro.  "Regular!" yelled Tom. "You give me a quarter on hyper and we'll go right through that planet!"  "One-quarter regular space speed," replied Astro.  Tom adjusted his controls for the speed reduction, while keeping his eyes on the teleceiver screen. He watched the planet grow larger before his eyes, and the terrain become more distinct. He could see two large oceans, the green-blue of the water reflecting the sunlight of Alpha Centauri brilliantly. Nearer and nearer the _Polaris_ plummeted, and Tom could begin to distinguish the rough outline of mountain ranges along the horizon line. He switched to a larger view of the planet on the magnascope that revealed a splendor rivaling the beauty of his own cherished Earth.  "We'll be entering the atmosphere in a minute, Alfie," yelled Tom into the intercom. "Stand by to give range for touchdown."  "Radar deck, aye," reported Alfie. "Range at present five hundred miles."  "Power deck, check in!" yelled Tom.  "Power deck, aye," returned Astro.  "All set below?" asked Tom.  "All set," said Astro.  "Reduce thrust to minimum!" shouted Tom.  Deep inside the powerful ship, the roar of the mighty atomic rocket motors began to fade to a deep growling purr.  "Control deck to radar deck. Major Connel, sir?"  "What is it, Corbett?" asked Connel.  "We're ready for a touchdown. Do you want to take over the bridge?"  "Can't you do it, Corbett?" asked Connel.  "Yes, sir!" replied Tom.  "Then carry on," replied Connel. "I'm having some trouble trying to get through to the Academy on the transmitter. Can't understand it." There was a pause. "I have them now, Corbett! You carry on!" he shouted.  "Aye, aye, sir," said Tom. He turned his attention to the control panel, checking the many dials and gauges with one sweeping glance, and then concentrated on bringing the ship to a safe landing on the foreign planet. His fingers tingled as he reached for the switches that would bring the ship down on the first intergalactic world he had ever visited. In a flash, the curly-haired cadet remembered childhood dreams of doing just what he was doing at this moment, preparing to touch down on a new world, millions of miles away from his home near New Chicago.  "Range one hundred miles," reported Alfie over the intercom.  "Power deck, reduce thrust to absolute minimum!" ordered Tom. "I want as little sustaining power as you can give me without cutting out altogether, Astro."  "Can do!" said Astro. The ship slowed even more, then suddenly picked up speed again as the gravity of Tara began to tug at the space traveler.  "Stand by to fire braking rockets!" yelled Tom. He was all nerves now, sensitive to the throbbing of the great ship's motors, eyes fastened to the dials and meters on the control panel. There was no time to watch the scanner view of the onrushing planet now. He had to touch down blindly, using only his instruments. "Radar bridge, report!" snapped Tom.  "Range one thousand feet," reported Alfie, his calm voice in striking contrast to the nervous excitement in Tom's. "Seven hundred fifty--six hundred--five fifty--"  "Fire braking rockets!" rasped Tom into the intercom.  The great ship bucked under the sudden thrust of the huge braking rockets. The _Polaris_ held steady for a moment, then gradually, as the pull of Tara began again, she settled back toward the dark-green jungles beneath her.  "Two hundred and fifty feet," reported Alfie. "One hundred and seventy-five--one fifty--" he droned.  "Ease her up, Astro," shouted Tom. "Easy! Ease her up, you Venusian clunk, we're dropping too fast!"  Once again, from the heart of the _Polaris_, there came a roaring blast of the powerful motors. The ship steadied once more and then slipped back into her fall toward the new planet under more sure control.  "Fifty feet," reported Alfie. "Forty--thirty--twenty--"  There was a brief pause, as if everything had stopped and they were held still by a giant hand, and then, suddenly, a rocking motion, a slight bump and rumble. Tom knew they were down.  "_Touchdown!_" he yelled at the top of his voice. "Touchdown! We made it--we made it!"  From the power deck, quiet except for the whining of the oxygen feed pump, Astro's bellow could be heard vibrating through the passageways.  "_Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeooooooooooooowwwwwww!_"  Tom began shutting off the many circuits and switches and made a quick last-minute check of the now dead ship. Satisfied, he glanced at the great solar clock, noted the time in the log, and stepped to the ladder leading to the radar bridge.  "Cadet Corbett reporting, sir," said Tom, saluting smartly. "I wish to report, sir, that the _Polaris_ made touchdown on the planet Tara at exactly seventeen fifty-nine, solar time!"  Connel, his great bulk bent over the tiny transmitter, was twirling the dials, his head encased in a vacuum earphone helmet to ensure perfect silence. He had acquired the knowledge of lip reading out of necessity on the power decks of the old chemical burners thirty years before, and while he couldn't hear what Tom had said, he knew what the report was.  "Very well, Corbett," he shouted, not being able to judge the volume of his voice. "Good job! Can't seem to pick them up at the Academy again. Had them once, then lost them. Am placing you in command of an expedition for a quick look outside. Arm yourselves with paralo-ray guns and rifles. Take a jet boat and under no circumstances are you to land. Dismissed! Oh, yes, one more thing. Take Alfie Higgins along with you and keep _your eye on him_. Report back in one hour!"  Tom felt a tingle of excitement run up his backbone as he heard the tough skipper give him permission to explore the planet.  He saluted and turned away, Alfie trailing him down the ladder.  "Hey, Astrooooo!" yelled Tom. "Get number-one jet boat out of the hatch. We're going for a look-see at this place!"  Tom went to the gun locker and took out three paralo-ray guns and rifles. He made sure each of them was fully loaded and then handed them to Alfie.  "Put these on the jet boat, Alfie. I'll be along in a minute."  Alfie took the guns and walked toward the jet-boat catapult deck. Tom returned to the radar bridge and stood before Connel.  "Would you see if there is any news of Roger, sir, when you make contact with the Academy?"  Connel read the cadet's lips and nodded his head. Tom turned and went directly to the jet-boat deck. Astro and Alfie waited for him inside.  "Brought along three space suits, Tom," said Astro. "You can never tell what we might run into."  "Good idea," said Tom.  The three cadets climbed into the jet boat, Tom taking the pilot's seat. He pushed a release button, and a portion of the _Polaris'_ steel hull slid back. Tom pressed another button, gripped the wheel of the small space craft, and stepped on the acceleration pedal. The little red ship shot out of the open hatch and zoomed over the giant trees.  Traveling at a slow speed, Tom made a wide arc over the forest, checking his position against that of the _Polaris_ before losing sight of it. He pulled the tiny ship up to one thousand feet, leveled off, set the automatic pilot, and took his first close look at Tara, four and a half light years from Earth.  From above, Tara seemed to be a quagmire of reptiles, dinosaurs, and dense vegetation reaching as high as the gleaming towers of Venusport and Atom City. Huge trees that spread their branches over an area of a thousand feet soared skyward, limbs and trunks wrapped in jungle creepers. Now and then Alfie would grasp Tom or Astro by the arm and point a wavering finger at a moving animal below, then gasp and fall back white-faced into his seat. While Tom was inclined to share Alfie's reactions, Astro took it in stride, having been exposed to the dangers of wild jungles on his own Venus.  The tiny jet boat raced out across the blue-green sea that swept up in giant swells along the snow-white sandy beaches. It was a temptation to set the small craft down and enjoy the pleasure of a swim after the many days of cramped, tortured living on the _Polaris_. But Tom remembered Connel's orders and also had a lot of respect for some of the things he had seen swimming in the water.  "Better get back," said Tom. He flipped the audiophone switch in the jet boat and spoke into a small mike.  "Jet boat one to _Polaris_. Jet boat one to _Polaris_. Cadet Corbett to Major Connel."  There was a crackle of static and then Connel's voice, vibrant and clear, filled the small cabin.  "Corbett!" he roared. "By the craters of Luna, I couldn't contact you. Return to the _Polaris_ on the double!"  "Is there something wrong, sir?" asked Tom, apprehensive after seeing the wildness of the jungle below him.  "Wrong?" blared Connel. "News from Earth--from the Academy! Roger's been cleared of all charges."  "Cleared?" stammered Tom.  "Absolutely! When I sealed the radar bridge after the crash, a security officer examined the settings on the scanners and transmitting equipment. They showed that Roger _had_ been on duty at the time--that he had been tracking the ship as he claimed."  "Then what was the reason for the crash?"  "Security isn't sure yet. An acceleration control lever is missing from the wreckage. And it wasn't broken off as a result of the crash. Now Loring and Mason are wanted for further questioning."  Tom looked at his unit-mate, Astro. The big Venusian had his head turned to one side; he seemed to be staring out over the vast writhing jungle.  "Astro, did you hear?" asked Tom softly.  "Yeah," mumbled Astro in a small, choked voice. "Just don't ask me to turn around."     CHAPTER 12   "How much longer before we reach the atmosphere of Tara, Manning?" asked Loring.  Roger bent over the chart table and quickly measured the distance between his present position and that of Tara.  "About two hours," he said, straightening up.  "Good!" said Loring. "Let me know soon as we get close."  "O.K.," replied the cadet.  "Hey, radar deck!" Mason's voice came over the intercom from the power deck of the _Space Devil_. "Don't forget to let me know when I have to cut down on thrust!"  "Take it easy, spaceboy," snapped Roger. "You'll know in plenty of time!" He turned back to the radar scanner and continued the never-ending sweep of space ahead.  After a week of checking and reconditioning the _Space Devil_ in the wild Venusian jungles, Roger had become more and more disgusted with himself. Being a wanted spaceman had had its disadvantages on Spaceman's Row, but working in the steaming jungles, fighting deadly reptiles and insects, with Loring and Mason on his neck every minute had soured his appetite for adventure. Several times, when Roger had suggested a certain part be replaced, Loring and he had argued violently, and Roger had threatened to quit. Now, after the long tedious trip through space, Roger's relationship with the others was more strained than ever. The sure dependability of Tom on the control deck and Astro on the power deck made the work of Loring and Mason sloppy by comparison. Once, when Roger had been on radar watch, while the ship roared through the asteroid belt, collision with a small asteroid had threatened. Roger ordered a course change, but Mason, who had taken over the power deck, had been asleep. Luckily, Shinny had been near by, had made the course change, and saved the ship. Seething with anger, Roger had gone to the power deck and given the shiftless spaceman a terrific beating.  Over and over, conflicts had arisen among them as they blasted through deep space, and always, it seemed to Roger, he was in the middle of it. The only satisfaction he could find in the hazardous venture was the prospect of the five million credits. And even this had lost its excitement in the last few days, as his nerves stretched to the breaking point. Only the sly humor of Shinny had saved Roger from the monotony of the long haul through space.  Roger absently flipped the scanner to its farthest range. He had been observing the planet Tara for several hours and knew its shape fairly well. But he suddenly jerked to attention. His hands trembled slightly as he peered intently at the scope. Finally he slumped back. There was no doubt about it. On the scanner was a jet boat in flight.  "Hey, Loring! Shinny! Mason! Get up here on the double!" he yelled into the intercom.  "What's up?" demanded Loring.  "Get up here!" shouted Roger. "We're in for trouble--plenty of trouble!"  Presently the three spacemen were grouped around the scanner, staring at the unmistakable outline of a jet boat.  "By the rings of Saturn," declared Loring, "it must be Connel and his crew!"  "What're we going to do?" whined Mason.  Loring's face darkened. "Only one thing we can do now," he growled.  "What do you mean?" asked Roger.  "I mean that we're going to blast them!" Loring snarled. "Connel and whoever else is with him!"  "But--but--" stammered Roger, "the _Polaris_ crew is down there!"  "Listen, Manning!" Loring turned to the cadet. "Have you forgotten that you're wanted by the Solar Guard? You give that bunch down there a chance and they'll make you a space crawler on prison rock!"  "Why--I--" stammered Roger. He knew what Loring had said was the truth. If it was Connel, there would be no question what would happen to him. He faced Loring. "What will you do to them?"  "One well-placed reactant bomb, and they'll never know a thing!" sneered Loring.  "But you don't have any bombs aboard," said Roger.  "A little of the fuel and I can build one easily enough," replied Loring. He turned to Mason. "Go below and suit up to go into the reaction chamber," he ordered. "Get an extra lead suit out. I'll go in and help you. And find something we can use for a trigger and a fuse." He smiled at Roger. "It might be a little crude, but it'll be fancy enough for what we want. I'm going to blast the _Polaris_ from here back to your sweet little Space Academy!"  Mason and Loring left the radar bridge while Shinny and Roger watched the white blip of the jet boat.  "That could be Tom and Astro in that jet boat," said Roger softly to himself.  "I guess I'd better stand by the power deck while we maneuver," said Shinny. "We wanta stay hidden until Loring and Mason get that thing ready."  Roger nodded, and Shinny disappeared.  Maneuvering cautiously, Roger brought the _Space Devil_ around to the night side of Tara opposite to the landing site of the _Polaris_.  Four hours later Loring and Mason came out of the reactant chamber carrying a small lead box. They placed it gently on the deck and began taking off their lead suits. Roger and Shinny stared at the box.  "There she is," said Loring. "Not much to look at, but there's enough juice in there to blast the _Polaris_ into space junk!"  "Wait a minute, Loring!" said Roger. "There'll be no killing! No one gets hurt!"  "Got a squeamish stomach, eh, kid?" Loring laughed. He slapped Mason on the back. "Our little Space Cadet is suddenly worrying about his friends. The same friends that wanted to send him away to the prison asteroid."  "Blast the ship if you want," said Roger coldly, "but don't hurt the crew!"  "Listen, Manning!" snarled Loring. "If the crew gets hurt it ain't my fault. If they're in the ship, that's tough. If not, then that's O.K. with me. I ain't sending them any letter telling them I'm going to blast their ship and then have them come up after me with a space torpedo!"  Roger didn't answer. He turned away and climbed back to the radar bridge. Loring followed him up the ladder.  "Don't get any ideas about warning your buddies, Manning, 'cause if you do, I'll blast you before I blast them!"  "Don't worry," replied Roger. "It's daytime on the other side of Tara now, where the _Polaris_ is. The crew might be out on a scouting mission or making observations away from the ship. There's less chance of their being on the ship. If we're going to do it, let's get it over with!"  "O.K. with me," said Loring. "Take this wagon up toward Alpha Centauri a little way. Coming out of the sun, they won't see us. We'll use one of the jet boats to deliver our little present. I'll set the fuse, put the jet boat on automatic, and aim it right for the _Polaris_."  "All right," agreed Manning reluctantly. He turned to the chart table, plotted a course, and issued orders to Shinny at the controls and to Mason on the power deck. Soon the _Space Devil_ was blasting away from the night side of the planet, heading toward the sun. When they reached an altitude of a thousand miles above the surface of the planet, Loring maneuvered the jet boat into position outside the ship and placed the crude reactant bomb inside. Ready, he gave Roger the signal to make the run out of the sun toward the _Polaris_. Roger relayed the orders to Shinny and Mason, and the _Space Devil_ rocketed back toward the planet again.  Loring, sitting inside the jet boat, waited until they had reached an altitude of five hundred miles.  "All right, Manning," said Loring, "give me the course!"  Roger calculated the rotational speed of the planet, the _Space Devil's_ altitude, and the speed of the jet boat. He drew a line between the _Space Devil_ and _Polaris_, checked it on the astro compass, and reached for the intercom mike. He ran a dry tongue over his lips and called out the course.  "Course is one forty-three--" He caught himself and stared at the chart. Suppose Tom or Astro or anyone was near the ship? Even if he missed by several hundred yards, the bomb would certainly be fatal. If he only changed the course one degree, at a range of five hundred miles, it would miss the _Polaris_ by several miles. And Loring wouldn't be able to see anything because of the dust cloud.  "Course corrected," said Roger. "New course is one forty-two!"  "One forty-two!" repeated Loring.  Roger sat back and waited for the small space craft to blast off from the ship. In his mind, he saw Loring setting the trigger on the bomb, adjusting the controls, setting the automatic pilot, and then pressing the acceleration button. Roger gripped the sides of the chart table and stared at the radar scanner. A fast-moving blip was streaking across its surface. Loring had started the jet boat.  His eyes showing his great fear, Roger watched the blip as it sped down like a maddened hornet toward the _Polaris_ resting on its directional fins in the green jungle. He could hear the hatch slam closed below as Loring re-entered the ship, but he continued to watch the rapidly moving blip.  Suddenly it disappeared, and Roger knew it had reached Tara. He slumped back in his chair. His eyes were glassy, his ears deaf to the roar of triumph from below as Loring and Mason, watching the flight of the jet boat on the control deck teleceiver screen, saw it explode. Roger couldn't move. He had fired a reactant bomb at Tom and Astro.   "By the craters of Luna," roared Connel, "we've been attacked!"  The four Earthmen, exploring a valley several miles north of the _Polaris_, had been thrown to the ground when the bomb landed. Connel's reaction was immediate and decisive.  "Get into the jet boat! All of you! We've got to get back to the _Polaris_! If our ship is smashed, we'll spend the rest of our lives fighting this jungle!"  In a matter of seconds the four spacemen were rocketing over the jungle toward the _Polaris_. Presently they came to an enormous dust cloud that had mushroomed out over the trees. It was so thick Tom found it difficult to pilot the small craft.  "Any danger of radioactivity in this dust, sir?" asked Astro.  "Always that possibility, Astro," answered Connel. "We'll know soon enough!" He flipped on a built-in Geiger counter on the dashboard of the jet boat, and immediately the cabin was filled with a loud ticking that warned of danger.  "The count is up to seven fifty, sir," said Astro. "Not enough to bother you unless you're in it a long time."  "There's the _Polaris_, sir," yelled Tom. "She's still on her directional fins! They missed her! She's O.K.!"  "By the blessed rings of Saturn, she is!" exclaimed Connel. "Go on, Tom, give this baby the gun! If we have to die, let's die like spacemen, in space, fighting with spaceman's weapons, not crawling around here in the jungle like worms!"  The three boys smiled at their skipper's rousing statement. "This is the time," thought Tom, "when I'd rather have Major Connel in command than anyone else in the Solar Guard." If there was to be a fight, then they certainly had found the man who knew how to do just that! Fight!  [Illustration]  Tom swooped over the treetops recklessly, and fearing the blast had damaged the jet-boat air lock, brought the small craft to rest in the blinding dust a few yards away from the _Polaris_.  Three minutes later the four spacemen had separated and were standing by their respective posts. Hasty but thorough checks were made to determine the damage, and finding none, they prepared to raise ship.  "All clear forward and up," Alfie reported in a high squeaking voice.  "Energize the cooling pumps," shouted Tom.  Astro had already started the mighty pumps, their vibrations rocking the ship, and Tom began counting the seconds.  "Stand by to raise ship. Minus five--four--three--two--one--_zeeroooooo!_"  Paying scant attention to the crush of sudden acceleration, Tom gave the ship all the power she could take for the climb out of Tara's atmosphere, and soon they were rocketing through the airless void of space. Alfie and Connel hurriedly swept the area with the radar scanner for the attacking intruder.  "There she is!" roared Connel. "There!" He placed a finger on a white blip on the scanner. "By the craters of Luna, that's an Earth ship!" The fear of an outer-space invasion by hostile people from another world had been in the back of his mind, but he had been reluctant to voice his fears in front of the cadets. "And she's an old one at that!" he exclaimed. "Not even armed. I know that class vessel. Corbett!" he shouted.  "Aye, aye, sir," replied Tom.  "Put the ship on automatic flight, attack-approach pattern number three. Then stand by to send a message to whoever's manning that ship!"  "Aye, aye, sir!" replied Tom. He hurriedly set the delicate device that would fly the ship in a preplanned course of zigzag maneuvers and opened the circuits of the teleceivers.  "All set for the message, sir," reported Tom.  "Tell them," said Connel heavily, his voice cold, "whoever they are, that I'll give them two minutes to surrender. If they don't, I'll blast them into protons!"  "Very well, sir," said Tom. He turned to the teleceiver and began twirling the dials.  "Attention! Attention! Rocket cruiser _Polaris_ to spaceship X. _Polaris_ to spaceship X. You are ordered to surrender within two minutes or we will attack. By order of Major Connel, Senior Line Officer, Solar Guard."  He switched the teleceiver for reception and waited. In a moment the screen blurred and then an image appeared. Tom gasped. It was Roger!  "Tom, Tom," yelled Roger. "Tom, this is me--Roger!"  "Roger! What're you doing out here? How'd you get here?"  "I can't explain now," said Roger. "I--I--"  Tom interrupted him. "Roger, you've been cleared! The investigation of the crash on the station proved that Loring and Mason are guilty. They're wanted for the crash and the deaths of Jardine and Bangs!"  "What! You mean--" stammered Roger.  "Yes. Loring and Mason did the whole thing!" supplied Tom.  "Look, Tom," pleaded Roger, "give me ten minutes. Don't fire for ten minutes! I'm going to try an idea. If I'm not successful, then open up and blast us back to Mars!"  "Roger, wait!" shouted Tom. "What's going on? What're you doing on that ship?"  "I can't talk now," answered Roger. "Loring and Mason are on the ship with me. Remember--ten minutes--and if I don't contact you, then open fire!"     CHAPTER 13   Roger flipped off the teleceiver. He stared at the darkened screen and began estimating the chances of success for a plan he had in mind. Deciding that, regardless of what happened, he had to take over the ship, he got up and turned toward the hatch and the gun locker. He stopped cold. Loring stood framed in the doorway, a paralo-ray gun in each hand.  "Just stand right where you are, spaceboy!" snapped Loring. "You want ten minutes, huh? Ten minutes for what? I thought there was something funny going on when we missed the _Polaris_ with that bomb!"  "You knew all along I didn't have anything to do with that crash back on the station, didn't you?" shouted Roger. His eyes blazed angrily.  "Yeah. So what?" growled Loring. "Hey, Mason," he yelled over his shoulder, "get up here in a hurry! We gotta work fast!"  "What are you going to do?" asked Roger.  "You're still valuable to us, Manning," said Loring with a crooked grin. "You're going to ensure our getting what we came after!"  Mason stepped through the door. "Yeah, Loring?"  Loring quickly told him of Roger's attempt to work with Connel.  "Take our spaceboy down below and lock him in a storage compartment." He handed over one of the paralo-ray guns, and Mason shoved the muzzle into Roger's stomach.  "Get moving, Manning!" he snarled. "I'd like nothing better than to let you have it right now!"  Roger smiled, knowing Mason still harbored a grudge for the beating he had taken earlier on the trip.  "When you have him locked up, get back on the control deck," said Loring. "We're going to do some old-fashioned bargaining with 'Blast-off' Connel!"  "Bargaining?" exclaimed Roger.  "Yeah! One slightly used Space Cadet for what we came after--the copper satellite!"  "Connel won't bargain," said Roger. "Not for me, not for anything. You don't know him!"  "I know this, Manning!" said Loring. "I'm going to get on the teleceiver and tell Connel that if he doesn't blast away from here _right now_, you're a dead Space Cadet!" He jerked his head toward the door. "All right, take him below and tell Shinny to stand by on the power deck. In case Connel won't bargain, we'll have to make a run for it!"  "Right," said Mason as he shoved the paralo-ray gun deeper into Roger's stomach. "Move, Manning!"  Roger climbed down the ladder and through the long passageway of the _Space Devil_. He passed Shinny on the way down.  "What's going on here?" demanded Shinny, seeing Mason with the paralo-ray gun.  "We missed with the bomb," said Mason, "and Connel raised ship. He's ready to blast us if we don't surrender right away. Loring's trying to make a deal with him."  "What kind of a deal?" asked Shinny.  "Hot-shot Manning for the satellite!"  "He hasn't told you everything, Mr. Shinny," said Roger in his casual drawl. "They are the ones who caused the crash of the _Annie Jones_ and the deaths of Jardine and Bangs. They framed me!"  "Then," mused Shinny, "you're cleared?"  "Yeah," growled Mason, "he's cleared! Cleared for a long swim in space if Connel doesn't do what Loring tells him! Get in there!" Mason shoved Roger into the cramped storage compartment. He locked the door and turned to Shinny.  "Loring wants you to stand by the power deck in case Connel won't play ball. We might have to make a run for it."  "Yeah, yeah," said Shinny, "I'll stand by the power deck."  Mason turned and walked away. Shinny followed him, a curious gleam in his eyes.  Up on the control deck, Loring was twisting the dials in front of the teleceiver screen.  "_Space Devil_ to _Polaris_--_Space Devil_ to _Polaris_--come in, _Polaris_." He twisted another dial and watched the darkened screen anxiously. After a moment the screen blurred, and Tom's face gradually came into sharp focus.  "Loring!" gasped Tom. "Where's Roger?"  "Never mind him, you punk!" snarled Loring. "Tell that fatheaded Connel I wanta talk to him! Make it fast!"  Tom's face disappeared to be replaced by the raging features of Major Connel. "You murdering space rat!" he roared. "I've given you two minutes to surrender and, by the craters of Luna, you've only got thirty seconds left!"  "It'll only take ten seconds to tell you that if you don't get outta here Cadet Manning gets blasted!"  "What?" roared Connel.  "That's right," snarled Loring. "You're the one that's got thirty seconds to get out of here, or Manning takes a swim in space!"  "Why, you--" Connel's face was twisted with rage. "You can't threaten me!"  "I ain't threatening you," said Loring, "_I'm telling you!_ If you don't get started, you'll never see Manning again. Or if you do, you won't recognize him! Now make up your mind, Connel!"  The Solar Guard officer hesitated. "Give me two minutes," he said, "and I'll call you back. Two minutes."  "Two minutes," repeated Loring, "and if I don't hear from you by then, or if you try any funny stuff, Manning gets it!"  Aboard the _Polaris_, the screen darkened, and Connel, his fists clenched, turned to Tom.  "We're helpless, Tom," he said softly. "Now that we have proof of Roger's innocence, I have to do everything in my power to save him."  Tom didn't say anything. Suddenly Connel smashed one huge fist into another. "But by the blessed rings of Saturn, when I _do_ get my hands on that Loring, I'll--I'll--" He broke off suddenly and turned back to the teleceiver. "I'm going to do what he wants, Tom. Roger's life is worth a dozen like Loring, and we'll have to take a chance that Loring will keep his word. After all," continued the big officer softly, "our mission is complete. We've tested the transmitter and found it to be more than we expected. No real reason why we should stay around here any longer."  "Yes, sir," stammered Tom. "Sir, I--I--"  Connel waved him silent with his hand. "You don't need to say anything, Tom. It's just one of those things. Still I can't help wondering what they came out here for." He turned to the dials on the teleceiver and began twisting them. "I'll call him, and you stand by to blast out of here."   Nicholas Shinny sat on the power deck and listened to Loring issue orders over the intercom.  "I don't know if Connel will go for it, or not," said Loring, "but just in case he doesn't, we gotta get outta here fast! You got that, Shinny?"  "Yeah," answered Shinny, "I got it!"  "Mason," yelled Loring, "you take over on the radar bridge!"  "All ready up here," said Mason.  "Well, be sure we've got a clear trajectory out. Better take us into the sun Alpha Centauri. That way, maybe they'll miss us on their radar. The sun will show all sorts of blips on their screen."  "O.K.," said Mason. "You think he'll go for it?"  "I don't know," answered Loring, "but if he doesn't, it's going to be space dust for Manning."  Shinny got up and walked around the deserted power deck. His legs felt weak. The plan he had made was a desperate one. Over and over, he checked the operation in his mind. It would have to be quick, sure, and sudden. That was the only thing that would ensure success. "Yes, sir," he thought, "if we can surprise 'em, we can get away with it." He dug out a piece of chewing tobacco, took a bite, eyed the remaining piece, and then shoved the whole thing in his mouth. His cheek bulged.  He went to the intercom and flipped it on. "Hey, Loring," he yelled. "I've got to check the timer on number-three rocket. She's not acting just right. It'll take me about a minute."  "O.K.," came Loring's reply, "but make it snappy."  The timers were to the left of the control board, but Shinny turned to the right and the ladder leading to the lower deck. He eased the hatch open, glanced around, and then climbed down quickly. He stopped at a locker, opened the doors quietly, and took out two paralo-ray guns and two rifles. Then, closing the doors, he made his way to the opposite side of the ship.  "Hey, Manning!" he whispered through the closed storeroom hatch. "Can ya hear me?"  "Who is it?" asked Roger.  "Me--Shinny," hissed the wizened spaceman. He opened the hatch and Roger quickly stepped out.  "What's the idea?" gasped Roger when Shinny shoved a rifle and pistol into his hands.  "I ain't got time to explain now," said Shinny. "We've got to hurry if we're going to take over this tub."  Roger's eyes glowed. "You mean--"  "Never mind what I mean," said Shinny. "Just listen. Loring's on the control deck and Mason's on the radar bridge. Loring's just talked to Connel. He's trying to make him blast outta here. If Connel doesn't, Loring's going to dump you in space!"  "Yeah, I know. That murdering space crawler!" snarled Roger. He gripped the rifle tightly. "I'll blast him--"  "Now wait a minute," hissed Shinny. "You go up and get Loring, see? Make it look like you got out by yourself. If you can handle him, O.K. I'll stay in back, and if anything goes wrong, I'll back you up!"  "Fine," said Roger. He patted the spaceman on the back and smiled. "Don't worry, Mr. Shinny, nothing will go wrong!"  "Watch your step. That Loring is a smart cookie!"  Roger turned into the passageway and made his way silently to the control-deck hatch. He peered around the edge of the hatch and saw Loring sitting in front of the teleceiver screen, his back toward Roger. The cadet quickly stepped into the control room, leveled the rifle, and said quietly, "All right, Loring, keep your hands in view!"  Loring spun around and stared openmouthed at Roger. "Mann--" he gasped.  "Yeah, me!" said Roger. "Call Mason and tell him to come down here on the double. But one wrong move, Loring, and I'll give you a quick freeze with this ray gun!"  Moving slowly, Loring turned to the intercom and flipped the switch. "Hey, Mason," he yelled. "Come down here a minute, will ya?"  "What do you want?" growled Mason. "I've got to figure out this course."  Roger stepped close to Loring, raising the gun.  Loring licked his lips and turned back to the intercom. "Don't gimme any back talk! I said get down here!"  Suddenly the teleceiver came to life. "_Polaris_ to _Space Devil_! Come in, Loring! This is Major Connel on the _Polaris_ calling Loring on the _Space Devil_!"  The suddenness of the voice startled Roger, and for a split second he took his eyes off Loring. In that instant Loring leaped for the boy, grabbing at the rifle. The quickness of his lunge caught Roger off guard and he was thrown back against the bulkhead, but he held onto the rifle as Loring tried to twist it out of his grasp.  "What th--" cried Mason from the ladder leading to the radar bridge. When he saw Roger and Loring struggling, he grabbed for the paralo-ray gun at his side. Just at that moment Shinny stepped through the hatch and fired his rifle. Mason was frozen into a rigid statue, unable to move.  "All right, Loring," yelled Shinny, "step back or I'll blast you like I did Mason!"  Roger wrenched the rifle out of Loring's grasp and stepped back. "Good work, Mr. Shinny!" he said to the little spaceman. "You sure figured it right!"  "Attention! Attention! This is Connel on the _Polaris_. Come in, Loring ..."  Shinny looked over at Roger and winked. "Better answer him, while I get this joker locked up." He motioned to Loring who stood backed up against the bulkhead, his hands high over his head.  "You dirty double-crossing space rat!" he snarled at Shinny.  "Now, now, none of that," said Shinny, leveling the rifle. "If you get too noisy, I'll freeze you like I did Mason to keep your trap shut!"  Loring cast a sidelong glance at Mason, who stood as if carved out of marble. The effects of the ray blast were devastating, having paralyzed his entire nervous system. While the victim was still able to breathe and his heartbeat remained normal, he was unable to move so much as an eyelid. The gun was developed after all lethal weapons had been outlawed by the Solar Alliance. Though any victim could be released from its paralyzing effect by a neutralizing charge from the same gun, while under its power the victim was reduced to a state of mild hysteria. He was able to hear, see, and think, but not to act. When released, it was not unusual to see a man crumple to the floor from exhaustion.  [Illustration: _Mason was frozen into a rigid statue, unable to move_]  Loring marched meekly in front of Shinny to the storage room that had held Roger. The cadet spaceman remained on the control deck. He twisted the dials of the teleceiver and spoke into the mike.  "_Space Devil_ to Major Connel. Come in! This is Manning on the _Space Devil_ calling Major Connel ..."  "Manning!" shouted Connel. "I thought you were a prisoner!"  "Ah, it was nothing, skipper," said Roger blandly. "I just took over the ship--with a little help, of course!"  "A little help?" asked Connel. "From whom?"  Roger then gave the officer a complete review of what had happened to him since leaving the space station, finishing with Shinny's aid in his escape.  "Why would he want to help you?" asked Connel.  "I don't know, sir," replied Roger.  "Well, never mind," said Connel. "I suppose you two can handle that ship all right between you. Land on Tara as soon as you can. I'll get the details then!"  "Aye, aye, sir," replied Roger. Then, just before breaking contact, he yelled into the mike, "Hey, Astro--Tom! See ya in a few minutes!"  As the teleceiver screen darkened, Shinny reappeared. He had released Mason from the effects of the ray charge, and both Mason and Loring were safe in the storage room. He walked over and slapped Roger on the back.  "Well, it looks like we did it, sonny boy!" he said.  Roger turned to look at the wizened spaceman who still was chewing on the plug of tobacco. "What made you do this for me, Mr. Shinny?" asked Roger quietly.  "Tell ya a little secret," said Shinny, with a merry twinkle in his eye. "I was in the Solar Guard for twenty years. Enlisted man. Got into an accident and hurt my leg, but it wasn't in the line of duty, so I was tossed out without a pension. Ever since then I been kinda bitter, you might say. And, strangely enough, it was Major Connel that kicked me out."  "But you--you--" gasped Roger.  "Let's just say," said Shinny with a smile, "that once you're a Solar Guardsman, you're always a Guardsman. Now, how about getting this wagon down to Tara?"  "Yeah, yeah, sure," said Roger absently, his eyes trailing after the small limping figure. Once a Solar Guardsman, always a Guardsman, he thought. Smiling, he turned to the control board. He felt the same way. He was a Guardsman, and it was good to be back home!  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 14   Major Connel paced nervously in front of the group of spacemen. Tom, Roger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny were lounging around the small clearing between the _Polaris_ and the _Space Devil_. A piece of thin space cloth had been stretched between the two ships to shield the men from the blazing sun. Connel stopped in front of Roger and Shinny.  "And you say the satellite is three-quarters solid copper?" asked Connel.  "Yes, sir," replied Roger, "at least that's what Loring and Mason told us."  "Where is it?" asked Connel. "I mean, where exactly?"  "I spotted her coming in, sir," replied Roger. "I'd say she was about three hundred thousand miles outside of Tara in perfect orbit."  "By the blessed rings of Saturn," exclaimed Connel, "it's almost too good to be true! The whole Solar Alliance needs copper desperately. And if what you say is true, that's enough to last for a hundred and fifty years!"  "Didn't you have any idea they discovered it, sir?" asked Tom. "I mean, when they took that unauthorized flight on your first trip out here?"  "Didn't suspect a thing, Tom," replied Connel. "I thought they had gotten a little space rocky on some homemade rocket juice and just went on a wingding. Imagine the colossal nerve of those two wanting to corner the market with the largest deposit of copper ever found."  "How do you plan to get it back, Major?" asked Shinny.  "I don't know, Shinny--"  "_Mr._ Shinny!" snapped the wizened spaceman. "_I'm_ not one of your cadets!"  "Still the hotheaded rocket buster, eh?" asked Connel, eying the toothless spaceman. "It was the same thing that got you kicked out of the Solar Guard twenty years ago!"  "Wasn't either! And you know it!" snapped Shinny. "You retired me because I busted my leg!"  "That helped," said Connel, "but the main reason was because you were too hotheaded. Couldn't take orders!"  "Well," said Shinny doggedly, "I ain't in no Solar Guard now, and when you talk to me, it's _Mr._ Shinny!"  "Why, you old goat!" exploded Connel. "I ought to arrest you for aiding criminals!"  "You can't do a thing to me," barked Shinny. "Prospecting is prospecting, whether it's in the asteroid belt or out here on Tara!"  Unable to hold back any longer, the four space cadets suddenly roared with laughter at the sight of the two old space foes jawing at each other. Actually, Connel and Shinny were glad to see each other. And when they saw the boys doubled up with laughter, they couldn't help laughing also. Finally Connel turned to Roger.  "Can you find that satellite again?" he asked.  "Yes, sir!" Roger grinned.  "All right, then," said Connel finally, "let's go take a look at it. I still won't believe it until I see it!"  "Who's hardheaded now?" snorted Shinny, climbing into the _Polaris_.  Later, as the rocket cruiser blasted smoothly through space, Connel joined Roger and Alfie on the radar deck. The two cadets were bent over the radar scanner.  "Pick her up yet?" asked Connel.  "There she is, right there, sir," said Roger, placing a finger on a circular white blip on the scanner. "But the magnascope shows pretty rugged country. I think we'd better take a look on the opposite side. Maybe we can find a better place to touch down."  "Very well, Manning," replied Connel. "Do what you think best. Tell Tom to land as soon as possible."  "Aye, aye, sir," replied Roger.  Leaving Alfie on watch at the scanner, Roger hurried down the ladder to the control deck where Tom was seated in front of the great board.  "Tom," called Roger, walking up behind his unit-mate, "we're going to take a look at this baby on the other side. See if we can't find a better place to touch down. Stand by to pick up the surface of the satellite on the teleceiver as soon as we get close enough."  "O.K., Roger," said Tom. "Where are you going?"  "Down to Loring and Mason in the cooler! I want to see their faces when I tell them they finally are getting where they wanted to go, but under slightly different circumstances!"  Tom laughed and turned back to the board. "Power deck, check in!"  "Power deck, aye," replied Astro. "When do we set down on the precious rock, Tom?" asked the Venusian.  "Should be soon, Astro," said Tom. "Better stand by for maneuvering."  "Right!" replied Astro.  Tom turned his full attention to the control board and the teleceiver screen above his head. He was happier than he had ever been in his life. The report sent back to Space Academy by Major Connel had been answered with a commendation to both Roger and Shinny for capturing Loring and Mason. With Roger back in the unit, Tom was at peace. Even Alfie was overjoyed at seeing Roger back aboard the _Polaris_.  And Tom had noticed that Major Connel was beginning to call them by their first names!  "Radar deck to control deck!" said Alfie. "From casual observations, Tom, the surface of the far side of the satellite is more suitable for a touchdown. I would suggest you observe the planetoid yourself with the magnascope and draw your own conclusions."  "O.K.," replied Tom. He switched the teleceiver screen on to the more powerful magnascope and studied the surface of the small celestial body. He saw a deep valley with a flat hard surface set between two tall cliffs. It would be a tricky spot for a landing, but it looked like the best place available. Tom snapped open the intercom.  "Attention! Attention! Stand by for touchdown. Power deck stand by for deceleration. Radar bridge stand by for range and altitude checks!" Sharply, crisply, Tom's orders crackled through the ship.  Working together with the ease and thoroughness of men well acquainted with their jobs, Astro and Shinny on the power deck, Roger and Alfie on the radar bridge, and Tom on the control deck handling the delicate maneuvering, combined to bring the great ship to a safe landing on the dry valley floor of the satellite.  "Touchdown!" yelled Tom and began securing the ship. Two minutes later the entire crew faced Major Connel for briefing.  "We'll all go out to different parts of the satellite and make geological tests," announced Connel. "We'll pair off, two to a jet boat. Astro and Roger, Alfie and Mr. Shinny, Tom and myself. This is a simple test." He held up a delicate instrument and a vial full of colorless liquid. "You simply pour a little of this liquid, about a spoonful, on the ground, wait about five minutes, and then stick the end of this into the spot where you poured the liquid." He held up a two-foot steel shaft a quarter inch in diameter, fastened to a clock-face gauge with numbers from one to a thousand. The other end of the shaft was needle sharp. "When you stick this into the ground, there'll be a reading on the meter. Relay it to me. This way well get an estimate of the amount of copper in a three-mile area for a depth of a hundred feet. It must be more than two hundred tons per square mile to make it worth while!"  He held up the testing equipment for all to see and explained its use once more. Then, giving each team a kit, he ordered them to the jet boats.  Just before the crew of Earthmen left the _Polaris_, Connel gave them last-minute instructions.  "Report back to the _Polaris_ in one hour. Make as many tests as you can over as wide an area as possible. Don't forget to leave one man in the jet boat while the other is making the test. Keep your audio communicator in the jet boat on at all times. And be sure your belt communicator is always open. Check your oxygen supply and space suits. All clear?"  One by one, the spacemen checked in through the audio communicators that all was clear. The sliding hatch on the side of the _Polaris_ was opened, and the jet boats blasted out into the brilliant sunlight of Alpha Centauri, going in three different directions.  Tom piloted his small craft over the rugged surface of the satellite, circling the larger peaks and swooping into the small valleys. Connel would indicate when it was time to stop, and Tom would set the craft down. While Connel made the tests, Tom would talk to the others over the audio communicators. The three small ships covered the satellite quickly in evenly divided sections, reporting their readings on the needlelike instrument to Connel, who kept recording the reports on a pad at his knee.  An hour later the boats returned to the _Polaris_ and the Earthmen assembled in the control room. Connel, Tom, and Alfie were busy reducing the readings of the tests into recognizable copper ton estimates per square mile.  Finally Connel turned around, wiped his brow, and faced the others.  "This is one of the greatest discoveries for Earthmen since they learned how to blast off!" The big officer paused and then held up the results of the tests. "This satellite is _really_ three-quarters solid copper!"  There was a loud mumble as everyone began talking at once.  "How are we going to get it back home, sir?" asked Tom. "Wouldn't hauling it back in spaceships cost too much?"  "Yes, it would, Corbett," answered Connel, "but I've got an idea how we can lick that problem."  "Can't see how you can lick it," snorted Shinny, "unless you take the whole blasted satellite back!"  "That's exactly what I'm going to do!" answered Connel.  "What?" exclaimed Roger, momentarily forgetting he was addressing a senior officer. "How in blazes are you going to do that?"  Connel turned to the chart-screen projector and switched it on. Immediately an image of Earth and its Moon, and much farther away the sun, was visible. Connel stepped to the screen and pointed to Moon.  "The Moon is a captive satellite of Earth, revolving around Earth the same way Earth revolves around the sun. It's the same situation we have here. This satellite is a captive of Tara, and Tara is a captive of Alpha Centauri. The difference is that the satellite is a peanut compared in size to the Moon, being only about fifteen miles in diameter. I'm not sure, but I think I can get enough reactant energy out of the _Space Devil's_ fuel supply to blast the satellite out of Tara's grip and send it back to our solar system in one piece!"  "You mean, sir," asked Tom, perplexed, "you'll tear the satellite out of Tara's gravitational pull?"  "That's right, Tom," replied Connel, "using the same principle to clear gravity that we use on the _Polaris_ or any spaceship. Enough power from the rockets will blast the _Polaris_ off Tara. Well, if you can get enough power, you can blast this satellite out of Tara's grip also, since the only thing holding it here is the gravity of Tara--the same thing that holds the Moon in orbit around Earth!"  Astro's eyes bulged. He looked at Connel blankly. "Why, sir," he stammered, "it'd take--take--a _ton_ of reactant fuel to pull something that size away from Tara. The _Polaris_ is a kiddy car in comparison!"  "You're right, Astro," said Connel, "but there's one thing you've forgotten. The copper of the satellite itself. That's going to be the main source of power. The reactant fuel from the _Space Devil_ will serve only as a starter, a trigger, you might say, to make use of the copper as fuel!"  Once again Astro gasped. "Then--then--there isn't anything to stop you, sir," he finished slowly.  Connel smiled. "I know there isn't. I'm going to contact Space Academy now for permission to pitch the biggest ball in the history of man!"  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 15   "Well, I'll be a star-gazing lunatic!" exclaimed Roger a few minutes later. "You really think that you can blast this satellite out of its orbit?"  "Not only that, Manning," said Connel with a smile, "but I might be able to get it back to our sun faster than we could get back ourselves."  "Why that would be the biggest project ever attempted by man, sir," said Tom. "You'd be transporting an entire satellite from one star system to another!"  "That's right, Corbett," said Connel. "I've just finished talking to Space Academy and they've given me permission to do anything I think necessary to accomplish just that. Now pay close attention to me, all of you. We haven't much time."  Tom, Roger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny gathered in a close circle around the major on the control deck of the _Polaris_ and watched him as he drew several rough diagrams on a piece of paper.  "Getting the satellite back is the trickiest part of the whole operation. Astro, are you sure you made a correct estimate on the amount of reactant fuel in the _Space Devil_?"  "Yes, sir," replied Astro. "I checked it four times, and Mr. Shinny checked it, too!"  "All right, then, listen," said Connel. "I've given the satellite a name. From now on we call it Junior. And this will be known as Junior's Pitch! I've explained how Junior is a captive satellite revolving around Tara, the same way our Moon revolves around Earth. We have two problems. One is to blast it out of Tara's grip. And the other is to take advantage of Tara's orbital speed around its sun Alpha Centauri, _and_ Junior's orbital speed around Tara. We've got to combine the velocities of the orbits, so that when we do spring Junior loose, he'll gain in speed!"  "But how do we get the orbital speeds to help us, Major?" asked Alfie. His glasses had slipped to the very end of his nose.  "If you'd give the major a chance, he'd tell you, Big Brain," drawled Roger. Alfie gave Roger a withering look and turned back to the major.  "Do you remember when you were kids and tied a rock on the end of a rope and then swung it around your head?" asked Connel.  "Sure, sorta like a slingshot," said Astro.  "That's right, Astro," said Connel, "and if you released the rope, the rock would fly in the direction it was headed, _when you let go_!"  "I get it," cried Tom excitedly. "The gravity of Tara is the rope holding Junior--ah"--he fumbled--"making it swing around!"  "And the reactant power of the _Space Devil_ placed in the right spot would be the trigger to make it let go!" commented Roger.  "It's as simple as that, boys!" said Connel with a smile.  "But how in the blazing beams of the sun are you going to _stop_ that blasted thing when you get it rolling?" asked Shinny.  "The chances of Junior hitting anything on the way home are so small it doesn't present a problem. So we just aim Junior for our solar system! Later on, arrangements can be made to steer it into an orbit around our sun."  "You know," wheezed Shinny, his merry eyes twinkling, "that sounds pretty neat!"  "It is," replied Connel. He leaned against the control-board desk top and folded his arms across his massive chest. He looked at each of the cadets and Shinny a long time before speaking. Finally he stepped forward and stood among them, turning now and then to speak directly to each of them.  "We have only four days, five hours, and some few minutes to pull Junior out of Tara's grip, and later, the grip of Alpha Centauri. You boys will have to work as you've never worked before. You'll do things you never dreamed you could do. You'll work until your brains ache and your bodies scream. But when you're finished, you will have accomplished one of man's greatest challenges. You're going to do all this because I know you can--and I'm going to see that you do! Is that clear?"  There was a barely audible "Yes, sir" from the cadets.  "The six of us, working together, are going to send a hunk of copper fifteen miles in diameter hurtling through twenty-three million million miles of space, so let's get that ball rolling. _Right now!_"  With Major Connel roaring, pleading, and blasting, four young cadets and a derelict spaceman began the monumental task of assembling the mass of information necessary for the satellite's big push through space. During the three days that their project had been under way, Tom, Roger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny worked, as Major Connel promised, as they had never worked before.  Late in the afternoon of the third day Connel stepped through the hatch of the control deck where Tom was busy over a table of ratios for balancing the amount of thrust from each of the reactant-power units. The power units were to give Junior its initial thrust out of the gravity of Tara.  "Well, Corbett," asked Connel, "how're you making out with the ratios?"  "I've finished them, sir," replied Tom, looking up at the major. His face was drawn, his eyes red from lack of sleep. "But I just can't seem to get a time for escaping the orbit on a true tangent."  "Have you tried making an adjustment for the overall pull of both components?" asked Connel. "That of Tara and of Alpha Centauri on Junior?" He picked up the paper Tom had been working on and glanced over the figures.  "Yes, sir," replied Tom, "but I still can't seem to make it come out right!"  "You'll get it, Tom," said Connel. "Go over it again. But remember. Time's running out. Just one day and about twenty hours left." Connel's voice was friendly--more friendly than at any time Tom could remember. He smiled, and taking a fresh sheet of paper, he began the complicated calculations of escape time all over again.  Connel slipped out of the control room and went below to the power deck, where Astro and Mr. Shinny had been working without sleep for over fifty hours. When Connel slipped into the room he found the two men puzzling over a drawing board.  "What seems to be the trouble, Astro?" asked Connel.  Astro turned, startled. "We've tried building that lead baffle for the reactant units five times now, sir," said Astro. "We're having a hard time getting the correct amount of reactant power we need in a unit this small."  "Maybe you're trying to make it _too_ small, Astro," commented Connel, looking over the drawing. "Remember, this unit has but one job. To _start_ the reaction. When the reaction fuel gets hot enough, it'll start a reaction of the copper on Junior and sustain itself. Try a smaller amount of the reactant. But whatever you do, keep working. Only a day and a few hours left."  Connel looked at Shinny. "Keep him working, Mr. Shinny," he ordered. "I know he can do it. Just keep him going."  Shinny grinned and nodded.  "I'll try, sir," said Astro, shaking his head, "but I won't guarantee it--"  Connel cut him off with a roar. "Cadet Astro, I don't want your guarantee! _I want that unit. Now build it!_"  Hour after hour the cadets racked their brains for what seemed like impossible answers to an impossible task. Working until their eyes closed fast shut, they would lie down right where they were--power deck, control deck, or radar bridge--and sleep. They would awake, still groggy, drink hot tea, eat cold sandwiches, and continue their struggle with time and astrophysics.  One by one, the problems were solved and set aside for newer ones that arose on the way. Each cadet worked in his particular field, and all of their information was assembled and co-ordinated by Major Connel. More than once, Connel had found the clever minds of his cadets reaching for answers to questions he knew would have troubled the professors back at Space Academy. Connel, his eye on the clock, his sharp tongue lashing out when he thought he detected unclear thinking, raced from one department to another while the incessant work continued. On the morning of the fourth day he walked into the radar bridge where Roger and Alfie had been working steadily for seventy-two hours on an electronic fuse to trigger the reactant units.  "There you are, skipper," said Roger. "The fuse is all yours. Delivered twelve hours ahead of time!"  "Good work, Roger. You too, Alfie. Excellent!" said Connel, his eyes appraising the fuse.  "Ah, that's nothing, skipper," said Roger with a smile. "Anyone could have done it with Alfie here to help. He's got a brain like a calculator!"  "Now, I want to see how smart you two really are!" said Connel.  "Huh?" asked Roger stupidly. Alfie had slumped to the deck, holding his head in his hands.  "I want a communications unit," said Connel, "that can send out a constant beam, a signal Space Academy can pick up to follow Junior in transit back to Earth."  "In twelve hours?" exploded Roger. "Impossible, skipper!"  "_Cadet Manning_," roared Connel, "I don't want your _opinion_, I asked for that _unit_!"  "But one day, sir," said Roger. "Not even a day. Twelve hours. I can't, sir. I'm sorry. I'm so tired I can't see straight."  Alfie let out a low moan.  Connel studied the two cadets. He was aware that he had already asked them to do the impossible, and they had done it. And they deserved to be let alone. But Major Connel wasn't himself unless he had given every ounce of energy he had left, or the energy left in those around him. He patted Roger on the shoulder and spoke softly.  "Roger, did I ever tell you that I think you have one of the finest brains for electronics I've ever seen? And that Alfie is sure to have a brilliant future in astrophysics?"  Roger stammered. "Why--ah--thank you, sir--"  Alfie looked up at Connel and then struggled to his feet.  "You know, Roger," he said haltingly, "if we took that unit we came out here to test--you know, the transmitter unit--"  [Illustration]  Roger cut him off. "Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. We could borrow some of the reaction mass that Astro got out of the _Space Devil_ and use that as a power source."  Connel backed away from the two cadets and tiptoed off the bridge. He smiled to himself. He was going to win his race with time yet! And he was going to do it because he had learned long before that you could only push a man so far, then you had to sit down, pat him on the back, tell him how smart he was, and he would push himself. Connel almost laughed out loud.  Six hours later Connel sat in his quarters puzzling over one of the many minor problems of Junior's Pitch when he heard footsteps behind him. He turned. Astro, Tom, Roger, Alfie, and Shinny walked silently into the room. Connel stared.  "Wha--what is it?" he demanded.  [Illustration]  "We're finished, sir," said Tom simply.  "Finished?" exploded Connel. "You mean--"  "That's what he means, skipper," said Shinny. His eyes were bloodshot for want of sleep, but there was a merry twinkle left tugging at the corners.  "Everything?" asked Connel.  "Everything, sir," said Roger. "The power units are built and the fuses installed. All it needs is to be set. Tom's worked out the ratios and the amount of reactant fuel needed in each unit for escape tangent. The escape time, combining orbital speeds of Tara and Junior, are completed, and we have six hours and fifty-five minutes before blast-off!" He turned and rumpled Alfie's hair. "Alfie and I have completed the communications unit and have tested it. Junior is ready to get his big kick in the pants!"  Connel stood up. He was speechless. It was almost too much to believe.  "_Get below_," he roared, "and go to sleep! If I catch one of you awake in five minutes, I'll log you fifty demerits!"  The tired workers grinned back at their commander.  "I'll get everything set," said Connel, "and wake you up an hour before we have to get things ready. Now _hit the sack!_"  Their grins spreading even wider on their haggard faces, they turned away. Connel stepped to the desk on the control deck and wrote across the face of the logbook page.  "... October 2nd, 2353. Space Cadets Corbett, Manning, Astro, and Higgins and ex-enlisted spaceman Nicholas Shinny completed this day all preparation for operation Junior's Pitch. By authority vested in me as Senior Officer, Solar Guard, I hereby recommend official commendation of "_well done_" to the above-mentioned spacemen, and that all honors pursuant to that commendation be officially bestowed on them. Signed, Connel, Major, SO--SG ..."  He closed the book and wiped the corners of his eyes with the back of his hand.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 16   "Well, fellows," said Tom, stifling a yawn, "it looks like we did it. But I could use some more sleep. That five hours was just enough to get started on!"  "Yeah," agreed Roger sourly, "but where does this Venusian lummox get off grabbing all the credit." He looked at Astro. "If I hadn't built the fuses for your little firecrackers--"  "_Firecrackers!_" yelped Astro. "Why, you skinny space fake! If I hadn't built those nuclear reactors, _you_ wouldn't have anything to set off!"  Connel appeared in the small messroom of the _Polaris_, his hands full of papers and drawings. "When you've finished congratulating each other, I'd like to say a few things!" he snapped.  "Congratulate _him_?" exclaimed Roger. "Skipper, his head's so thick, the noise on the power deck can't even reach his eardrums!"  "Just one more word, Manning," growled Astro, "and I'll take a deep breath and blow you away!"  "_One more word out of either of you_," roared Connel, "and I'll throw you both in the brig with Mason and Loring!"  Suddenly he glared at the five spacemen. "Who's on prisoner watch today?" he asked.  The four cadets and Mr. Shinny looked at each other then at Roger.  "Uhhh--I am, sir," Roger confessed.  "I had a sneaking suspicion you would be!" said Connel. "Cadet Manning, one of the first things an officer of the Solar Guard learns is to care for the needs of his men and prisoners before himself. Did you know that, Cadet Manning?"  "Uhhh--yes, sir. I was just going to--" mumbled Roger.  "Then go below and see that Mason and Loring get their rations!"  "Yes, sir," said Roger. He got up and collected a tray of food.  "All of you report to the control deck in five minutes for briefing," said Connel and followed Roger out of the door.  "How do you like that?" said Astro. "We break our backs for the guy and we're no sooner finished then he starts the old routine again!"  "That has nothing to do with it, Astro," said Tom. "Put yourself in his position. We've only got one or two things to think about. He's responsible for it all."  "Just like he was when I sailed with him twenty-five years ago," said Shinny. He swallowed the remains of his tea and reached for a plug of tobacco. "He's all spaceman from the top of his head to the bottom of his space boots."  "I'm rather inclined to agree with you, Tom," said Alfie mildly. "Leadership carries with it the greatest of all burdens--responsibility for other peoples' lives. You, Corbett, as a control-deck cadet, would do well to mark Major Connel's pattern of behavior."  "Listen," growled Astro, "if Tom ever turned out to be a rocket buster like Connel--I'd--I'd--"  "Don't worry, Astro," Tom said, laughing. "I don't think there'll be another Major Connel in a million light years!"  Shinny laughed silently, his small frame shaking slightly. "Say it again, Tommy. Not in the whole universe will there ever be another like old 'Blast-off' Connel!"  On the deck below the messroom, Roger, balancing a tray carefully on one hand, opened the electronic lock of the brig and then stepped back quickly, leveling a paralo-ray gun.  "All right, Mason, Loring," he yelled, "come and get it!" The door slid open, and Loring stuck his head out. "Any funny business," Roger warned, "and I'll stiffen you so fast, you won't know what hit you!"  "It's about time you showed up!" growled Loring. "Whaddaya trying to do, starve us to death?"  "That's not a bad idea!" said Roger. Loring took the tray. Roger motioned him back inside the brig and slammed the door shut. He locked it and leaned against the grille.  "Better eat it while you can," he said. "They don't serve it so fancy on a prison asteroid."  "You'll never get us on a prison asteroid," whined Mason.  "Don't kid yourself," said Roger. "As soon as we get the reactor units set, we're going to send this hunk of copper back to Earth and then take you back. They'll bury you!"  "Who's going to do all that?" snapped Loring. "A bunch of punk kids and a loudmouthed Solar Guard officer?"  "Yeah," retorted Roger.  "_Cadet Manning!_" Connel's voice roared over the intercom. "You were ordered to report to the control deck in five minutes! You are already one minute late! Report to the control deck on the double and _I mean double!_"  Loring and Mason laughed. "Old 'Blast-off' Connel's really got your number, eh, kid?"  "Ah, rocket off, you pinheaded piece of space junk! It didn't take him long to dampen _your_ tubes!"  Connel roared again. "_Blast your hide, Manning, report!_"  "Better raise ship, Manning," said Loring, "you might get another nasty demerit!"  Roger turned away and raced to the control deck. He entered breathlessly and stood beside his unit-mates while Connel eyed him coldly.  "Thank you, Cadet Manning," said Connel. "We appreciate your being here!"  "Yes, sir," mumbled Roger.  "All right," barked Connel, "you know your assignments. We'll take the jet boats as before and go out in pairs. Tom and myself, Astro and Roger, and Shinny and Alfie. We'll set up the reaction charges on Junior at the points marked on the chart screen here." He indicated the chart on the projection. "Copy them down on your own charts. Each team will take three of the reaction units. My team will set up at points one, two, and three. Astro and Roger at four, five, and six. Alfie and Shinny at seven, eight, and nine. After you've set up the charges, attach the triggers for the fuses and return to the ship. Watch your timing! If we fail, it'll be more than a year before Junior will be in the same orbital position again. How much time do we have left, Corbett?"  Tom glanced at the clock. "Exactly two hours, sir," he said.  "Not much," said Connel, "but enough. It shouldn't take more than an hour and a half to set up the units and get back to the ship to blast off. All clear? Any questions?"  There were no questions.  "All right," said the officer, "put on your space gear and move out!"  Handling the lead-encased charges carefully, the six spacemen loaded the jet boats and, one by one, blasted off from the _Polaris_ to positions marked on the map.  Working rapidly, each of the teams of two moved from one position to another on the surface of the desolate satellite. Connel, referring constantly to his watch, counted the minutes as one by one the teams reported the installation of a reactor unit.  "This is Shinny. Just finished installing reaction charge one at point seven ..."  "This is Manning. Just finished installing reaction charge at point four ..."  One after the other, the teams reported. Connel, with Tom piloting the jet boat, finished setting up their units at points one, two, and three and headed back to the _Polaris_.  "How much time, sir?" asked Tom as he slowed the small craft for a landing.  "Less than a half hour, Corbett," said Connel nervously. "I'd better check on Shinny and Alfie." He called into the audiophone. "Major Connel to Shinny and Higgins, come in Shinny--Higgins!"  "Shinny here!" came the reply. "We're just finishing up the last unit. Should be back in five minutes."  "Make it snappy!" said Connel. "Less than a half hour left!"  "We'll make it," snorted Shinny.  "Coming in for a touchdown," said Tom. "Better strap in, sir!"  Connel nodded. He laced several straps across his lap and chest, gripping the sides of the seat. Tom sent the jet boat in a swooping dive, cut the acceleration, and brought the small ship smoothly inside the huge air lock in the side of the _Polaris_.  "I'd better get right up on the control deck and start warming up the circuits, sir," said Tom.  "Good idea, Tom," said Connel. "I'll try and pick up Manning and Astro."  Tom left the officer huddling over the communicator in the jet boat.  "Major Connel to Manning and Astro, come in!" called Connel. He waited for a moment and then repeated. "Manning--Astro, come in! By the rings of Saturn, come in!" There was the loud roar of an approaching jet boat. Shinny guided the ship into the _Polaris_ with a quick violent blast of the braking rockets. The noise was deafening.  "Belay that noise, you blasted space-brained idiot!" roared Connel. "Cut that acceleration!"  Shinny grinned and cut the rockets. The jet-boat catapult deck was quiet, and Connel turned back to the communicator.  "Come in, Manning--Astro! This is Major Connel. Come in!"  On the opposite side of the airless satellite, Roger and Astro were busy digging a hole in the hard surface. Near by lay the last of the explosive units to be installed. Connel's voice thundered through their headset phones.  "Boy, is he blasting his jets!" commented Roger.  "Yeah," grunted Astro. "He should have to dig this blasted hole!"  "Well, this is where it's got to go. If the ground is hard, then it's our tough luck," said Roger. "If we stick it anywhere else, it might mess up the whole operation."  Astro nodded and continued to dig. He held a small spade and jabbed at the ground. "How much--time--have we got left?" he gasped.  "Twenty minutes," replied Roger. "You'd better hurry."  "Finished now," said Astro. "Get the reactor unit over here and set the fuse."  Roger picked up the heavy lead box and placed it gently inside the hole.  "Remember," Astro cautioned, "set the fuse for two hours."  "No, you're wrong," replied Roger. "I've set the fuses each time, subtracting the amount of time since we left the _Polaris_. I set this one for twenty minutes."  "You're wrong, Roger," said Astro. "It's maximum time is two hours."  "Listen, you Venusian clunk," exploded Roger, "_I_ built this thing, so I know what I'm doing!"  "But, Roger--" protested Astro.  "Twenty minutes!" said Roger, and twisted the set-screw in the fuse. "O.K., it's all set. Let's get out of here!"  The two cadets raced back to the jet boat and blasted off immediately. Once in space, Astro turned to Roger.  "Better check in with Major Connel before he tears himself to pieces!"  "Yeah," agreed Roger. "I guess you're right." He flipped on the audio communicator. "Attention! Attention! Manning to Major Connel. Am making flight back to _Polaris_. All installations complete."  [Illustration: "_Remember," Astro cautioned, "set the fuse for two hours._"]  "What took you so long, Manning?" barked Connel in reply. "And why didn't you answer me?"  "Couldn't, sir," said Roger. "We had a tough time digging a hole for the last unit."  "Come back to the _Polaris_ immediately," said Connel. "We're blasting off in fifteen minutes."  "Very well, sir," said Roger.  Presently the jet boat circled the _Polaris_ and made a landing run for the open port. Roger braked the small craft and brought it to rest alongside the others.  "That's it, spaceboy," he said to Astro. "All out for the _Polaris_ express back home!"  "Just be sure you give me a good course, Manning," grunted Astro, heaving his huge frame out of the small cabin of the jet boat, "and I'll give you all the thrust you want!"  Astro secured the jet boats while Roger closed the air-lock hatch, shutting out the last view of the rugged little planetoid. Roger threw the landscape a mocking kiss.  "So long, Junior! See you back home!" The two cadets climbed the ladder leading to the control deck.  Seated in front of the control panel, Tom watched the sweeping hand of the solar clock. Connel paced nervously up and down behind him. Shinny and Alfie stood to one side also watching the great clock.  "How much time, Corbett?" asked Connel for the dozenth time.  "Junior gets his kick in the pants in ten minutes, sir," replied Tom.  "Fine," said Connel. "That gives me just enough time to notify Space Academy to get ready to receive Junior's signal. You know what to do?"  "I don't have to do anything, sir," answered Tom, nodding to the solar clock over his head. "In nine minutes and twenty seconds, the reactor units go off automatically at one-second intervals."  Roger and Astro entered the control deck and came to attention. Connel returned their salute and put them at ease.  "All right, our work here is done," said Connel. "No point in hanging around any longer. Tom, you can blast off immediately."  "Yes, sir," replied Tom.  Connel climbed the ladder to the radar bridge to contact Space Academy. Astro, Roger, Shinny, and Alfie went to their posts and began quick preparations for the blast-off. One by one, they checked in to Tom on the control deck.  "Power deck, ready to blast off!" reported Astro.  "Radar bridge, all set. Clear trajectory forward and up," said Roger.  "Energize the cooling pumps!" bawled Tom into the intercom.  The great pumps began to wheeze under the strain of Astro's sudden switch to full load without the usual slow build-up. Tom watched the pressure needle rise slowly in front of him and finally reached out and gripped the master switch.  "Stand by to raise ship!" he yelled. "Blast off minus five--four--three--two--one--_zeroooooo!_"  He threw the switch. The great ship shivered, vibrated, and then suddenly shot away from the precious satellite. Tom quickly adjusted for free fall by switching on the synthetic-gravity gyro generators and then announced over the intercom,  "Major Connel! Cadet Corbett reporting. Ship space-borne at exactly thirty-one, sir!"  "Very well, Corbett," replied Connel. "Space Academy sends the crew a '_well done!_' Everything's set back home to take over the beam as soon as Junior starts on his way back. How much time until zero blast-off on the satellite?"  Tom glanced at the clock. "Less than two minutes, sir!"  "All right," said Connel over the intercom, "everybody to the control deck if you want to see Junior do his stuff!"  In a moment the six spacemen were gathered around the magnascope waiting for the final act of their great effort. Breathlessly, their eyes flicking back and forth from the solar clock to the magnascope, they waited for the red hand to sweep around.  "Here it comes," said Tom excitedly. "One second--two seconds--three--four--_five!_"  On the surface of the planetoid, giant mushrooming clouds appeared climbing into the airless void. One by one the reactor units exploded. Connel counted them as they blew up.  "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight--" he paused. Junior began moving away from them. "Nine!" shouted Connel. "What happened to nine?"  "Roger," shouted Astro, "you made a mistake on the timer!"  "But I couldn't. I--I--"  Connel spun around, his eyes blazing, breathing hard. "What time did you set the last one for, Roger?" he demanded.  "Why, twenty minutes to blast-off time, sir," answered the blond-headed cadet.  "Then it won't go off for another forty minutes," said Connel.  "But, sir--" began Roger, and then fell silent. The room was quiet. Everyone looked at Roger and then at Connel. "Honestly, sir, I didn't mean to make a mistake. I--" pleaded Roger.  Connel turned around. His face suddenly looked very tired. "That's all right, Roger," he said quietly. "We've all been working pretty hard. One little mistake is bound to show up in an operation like this." He paused. "It's my fault. I should have checked those fuses myself."  "Does it make so much difference, sir?" asked Astro.  "A lot of difference, Astro," said Connel. He sat down heavily.  "But how, sir?" asked Tom.  "It's very simple, Tom," answered Connel. His voice was strangely quiet. "Junior spins on its axis in two hours, just as Earth spins in twenty-four hours. I thought we had the explosions timed so at the proper moment we'd push Junior out of his orbit around Tara, and the greater orbit around Alpha Centauri, by utilizing both speeds, plus the initial thrust. But by being one blast short, forty minutes late, the explosion will take place when Junior is forty minutes out of position"--he paused and calculated rapidly in his mind--"that's about forty-eight thousand miles out of position. When it goes off, instead of sending Junior out into space, it'll blast it right into its own sun!"  "Isn't there something we can do, sir?" asked Tom.  "Nothing, Corbett," answered Connel wearily. "Instead of supplying the Solar Alliance with copper, in another week Junior will be hardly more than a molten piece of space junk." He looked at the teleceiver screen. All ready, Junior was falling away.  "Stand by for full acceleration, hyperdrive," said the big officer in a hoarse whisper. "We're heading home!"     CHAPTER 17   The subdued whine of the hyperdrive filled the power deck and made Roger wince as he stepped through the hatch and waved at Astro. He climbed down the ladder and stopped beside the big Venusian who stood stripped to the waist, watching the pressure gauges on the power-deck control board.  "Hiya, Roger," said Astro with a big grin.  "Hello, Astro," replied Roger and sat down on a stool near by.  "Excuse me a minute, hot-shot," said Astro. "Gotta check the baffling around reaction tube three." The big cadet hurriedly donned a lead-lined protective suit and entered the reaction chamber. After a moment he reappeared and took off the suit. He poured a glass of water, handed it to Roger, and poured another for himself.  "Gets pretty hot down here," he said. "I don't like to use the air conditioner when I'm on hyperdrive. Sucks my power output and reduces pressure on the oxygen pumps."  Roger nodded absently at the needlessly detailed explanation. Astro looked at him sharply. "Say, what's eating you?"  "Honestly, Astro," said Roger, "I've never felt more miserable in my life."  "Don't let it get you down, Roger," said Astro. "The major said it was a mistake anyone could make."  "Yeah," flared Roger, "but have you seen the way he just--_talks_?"  "Talks?" asked Astro blankly.  "Yeah, talks," said Roger. "No yelling, or blasting off, or handing out demerits like they were candy. Nothing! Why he hasn't even chewed Alfie out since we left Junior. He just sits in his quarters."  Astro understood now and nodded his head in agreement. "Yeah, you're right. I'd rather have him fusing his tubes than the way he is now."  "Tom must feel pretty rotten, too," said Roger. "I haven't seen much of him either."  "Or Alfie," put in Astro. "Neither of them have done anything but work. I don't think either of them has slept since we left Tara."  "It's all my fault!" said Roger. "I'm nothing but a loudmouthed bag of space gas--with an asteroid for a head!" He got up and lurched toward the ladder.  "Hey, where you going?" yelled Astro.  "Almost forgot," yelled Roger from the top of the ladder. "I've got to feed our prisoners a meal. And the way I feel, I'd like to shove it down their throats!"  Roger went directly to the galley off the control deck and prepared a hasty meal for Loring and Mason. He piled it on a tray and went below to the brig.  "All right, Loring," he growled, "come and get it!"  "Well, well, well," sneered Loring. "Where's the big Manning spirit? You boys are kinda down since you blew that little operation, huh?"  "Listen, you space crawler," said Manning coldly, "one more word out of you and I'll bring you out in the passageway and pound that head of yours into space junk!"  "I wish you'd try that, you little squirt!" snarled Loring. "I'd break you in two!"  "O.K., pal," said Roger, "I'm going to give you that chance!" He opened the door to the cell and Loring stepped out. Holding the paralo-ray gun on him, Roger relocked the door. Left inside, Mason stuck his face close to the grille.  "Give it to him, Loring," he hissed. "Take him apart!"  Roger threw the paralo-ray gun in the corner of the passageway and faced the heavier spaceman. He held his arms loosely at his side, and he balanced on the balls of his feet. A slight smile played at the corners of his mouth.  "Start breaking, Loring," he said quietly.  "Why, you--" snarled Loring and rushed in. He swung wildly for Roger's head, but the cadet slipped inside the punch and drove a hard right to Loring's mid-section. The prisoner doubled over, staggered back, and slowly straightened up. Roger's lips were drawn tightly in a grimace of cold anger. His eyes were shining hard and bright. He stepped in quickly and chopped two straight lefts to Loring's jaw, then doubled the spaceman up again with a hard right to the heart. Loring gasped and tried to clinch. But Roger threw a straight jolting right to his jaw. The prisoner slumped to the floor, out cold. The fight was finished.  Roger went over, picked up the paralo-ray gun, and opened the cell door again.  "All right, Mason," he said coldly, "drag him inside. And if you want to try me for size, just say so."  Mason didn't answer. He merely hurried out, and grabbing Loring by the feet, dragged him inside. Roger slammed the door and locked it.  [Illustration]  Rubbing his knuckles and feeling better than he had felt for days, he started back to the radar bridge. As he neared Major Connel's quarters, he heard Connel's voice. He stopped and listened outside the door.  "It's a beautiful job of calculation, Tom," Connel was saying. "I don't see how you and Higgins could have done it in so short a time. And without an electronic computer to aid you. Beautiful job--really excellent--but I'm afraid it's too risky."  "I've already talked to Astro and Mr. Shinny, sir," said Tom, "and they've volunteered. I haven't spoken to Roger yet, but I'm sure he'd be willing to try."  Roger stepped through the door.  "Whatever it is," said Roger, "I'm ready."  "Eavesdropping on your commanding officer," said Connel, eying the blond-headed cadet speculatively, "is a very serious offense."  "I just happened to hear my name mentioned, sir," replied Roger with a smile.  Connel turned back to Tom. "Go over that again, Tom."  "Well, sir," said Tom, "Junior's falling into the sun at a speed of twenty-two miles a second right now. But we could still land a jet boat on Junior, set up more nuclear explosions to blast him out of the sun's grip, and send him on his way to our solar system. We wouldn't get as much speed as before, but we'd still save the copper."  By this time, Astro and Shinny had joined the group and were standing outside the door in the passageway, listening silently.  Connel tugged at his chin. "Let's see," he said, "if we could get back to Tara in three days ..." He looked up at Astro. "Do you think you could get us back in three days, Astro?"  "Major Connel, for another crack at Junior," roared the big Venusian, "I'd get you back in a day and a half!"  "All right," said Connel. "That's one problem. But there are others."  "What, sir?" asked Tom.  "We have to prepare reactant fuses and we have to build new reactor units. If we could do that--"  "If Astro can get us back," said Shinny, "and Roger and this smart young feller here, Alfie, can make up some fuses, I'll build them there units. After all, Astro showed me how once. I guess I can follow his orders!"  "Good!" said Connel. "Now there is the element of time. How much time would we need on Junior?" He looked at Tom.  "Let me answer this way, sir," said Tom. "We'd only have two hours to plant the reaction charges and trigger them, but that should be enough."  "Why so close, Tom?" asked Roger.  "It has to be," answered Tom. "We know what the pull of the sun is, and the power of the jet boat. When the sun's pull becomes greater than the escape speed of the jet boat, the boat would never clear. It would keep falling into the sun. I've based this figure on reaching Junior at the last possible moment."  "It'd take at least five men to set up the five explosions we need," mused Connel. "That means one of us will have to stay on the _Polaris_."  There was an immediate and loud chorus of "Not me!" from everyone.  "All right," said Connel, "we'll draw numbers. One, two, three, four, five, and six. The man who draws number six will stay with the _Polaris_. All right?"  "Yes, sir," said Tom, glancing around. "We agree to that."  Connel went to his desk and wrote quickly on six slips of paper. He folded each one, dumped them in his cap, and offered it to Astro.  "All right, Astro," said Connel, "draw!"  Astro licked his lips and stuck in his big paw. The Venusian fingered several, then pulled out a slip of paper. He opened it and read aloud. "Number two! I go!" He turned and grinned at the others.  Connel offered his cap to Alfie. Alfie dipped in two fingers and pulled out a slip. "Number four! I go!" he squealed.  Roger and Shinny drew numbers one and three. Tom looked at the major. "Go ahead, Corbett," said Connel.  "After you, sir," said Tom.  "I said draw one!" roared Connel.  "Yes, sir," said Tom. He reached in and quickly pulled out one of the two remaining slips.  "Number six," he said quietly. "I stay."  Connel, not bothering to open the last one, slapped the hat on his head and turned away.  "But, sir," said Tom, "I--ah--"  Connel cut him off with a wave of his hands. "No _buts_!" He turned to the others. "Manning, Higgins! Get me a course back to Junior and make it clean and straight. Astro, Shinny, stand by on the power deck for course change. Tom, get on the control deck. We're going back to snatch a hot copper filling right out of a sun's teeth!"   Once again the energy of the six spacemen was burned in twenty-four hour stretches of improvisation and detailed calculations. Roger and Alfie redesigned the fuse to ensure perfect co-ordination of the explosions. Astro and Shinny surpassed their previous efforts by putting enough power in the five small reaction units to more than do the job required. Tom, standing long watches on the control deck, devoted his spare time to the torturous equations that would mean failure or success to the whole project. And Major Connel, alert and alive once more, drove his crew toward greater goals than it had achieved before.  Nearly three days later, the _Polaris_ appeared over the twin oceans of Tara and glided into an orbit just beyond the pull of the planet's gravity. Aboard the spaceship, last-minute preparations were made by the red-eyed spacemen.  In constant contact with Space Academy, using the resources of the Academy's scientific staff to check the more difficult calculations, the six men on the _Polaris_ worked on.  Connel appeared on the radar bridge and flipped on the long-range scanner.  "Have to find out where Junior is," he said to Roger and Alfie.  "That doesn't work, sir," said Roger.  "What do you mean it doesn't work?" exploded Connel.  "Junior's falling into the sun, sir. The radiations are blocking it out from our present position."  "Couldn't we move to another position?" asked the officer.  "Yes, sir," said Roger, "we could. But to do that would take extra time, and we haven't got it."  "Then how are you going to find Junior?" asked Connel.  "Alfie's busy with a special scanner, sir, one that's especially sensitive to copper. Since the sun is composed mostly of gas, with this filter only Junior will show up on the screen."  "By the rings of Saturn," exclaimed Connel, "you mean to tell me that Alfie Higgins is building a new radar scanner, just like that?"  "Why, yes, sir," answered Roger innocently. "Is there something wrong with that?"  "No--no--" said Connel, backing off the bridge. "Just--just go right on. You're doing fine! Yessirree, fine!" He literally ran from the bridge.  "Most humorous of you, Manning," said Alfie, smiling.  "I'll tell you something funnier than that," said Roger. "I feel the same way he does. Is there anything you _can't_ do, Alfie?"  Alfie thought a moment. "Yes, there is," he said at last.  "What?" demanded Roger.  "I can't--shall I say?--make as much progress as you do with--er--space dolls."  Roger's jaw dropped. "Space dolls! You mean--girls?"  Alfie nodded his head.  "Listen," said Roger, "when we get Junior on his way home, and we get back to the Academy, I promise you I'll show you how to really blast your jets with the space lovelies in Atom City!"  Alfie put out his hand seriously. "And if you do that for me, Roger, I'll show you how to use the new electronic brain they recently acquired at the Academy. Only one other person can operate it. But you definitely have the potential."  Roger stared at him stupidly. "Huh? Yeah. Oh, sure!"  Gradually the mass of data was brought together and co-ordinated, and finally, as Tom stood beside him, Major Connel checked over his calculations.  "I can't see a thing wrong with it, Tom," Connel said at last. "I guess that's it. Figuring we land on Junior at exactly seventeen hundred hours, we'd reach the point of no return exactly two hours later."  "Shall I alert stations to blast off for Junior?" asked Tom.  "Yes," said Connel, "bring the _Polaris_ to dead ship in space about three hundred miles above Junior. That's when we'll blast off in jet boats."  "Yes, sir," said Tom. His eyes bright, he turned to the intercom. "All right, you space babies," he announced, "this is it. Stand by to blast Junior. Here we come!"  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 18   Dawn broke over the tangled jungles of Tara, followed by the bright sun of Alpha Centauri rising out of the eastern sea and slowly climbing higher and higher. In the dense unexplored wilderness, living things, terrible things, opened their eyes and resumed their never-ending quest for food. Once again Alpha Centauri had summoned one hemisphere of its satellite planet to life.  Meanwhile, high in the heavens above Tara, six Earthmen blasted into the flaming brilliance of the sun star. Using delicate instruments instead of claws, and their intelligence instead of blind hunger, they prepared to do battle with the sun star and force it to release the precious copper satellite from its deadly, consuming grasp.  The crew of the _Polaris_ assembled on the control deck of the great spaceship, and facing their commanding officer, waited patiently for the word that would send them hurtling out to their target.  "The jet boats are all ready, sir," reported Tom. "We're dead ship in orbit around Junior at an altitude of about three hundred miles."  "Does that mean we're falling into the sun too?" gasped Shinny.  "It sure does, Mr. Shinny," said Alfie, "at more than twenty miles per second."  "The jet boats have enough power to get back from Junior to the _Polaris_, Mr. Shinny," reassured Tom. "And then the _Polaris_ can blast off from here. The jet boats wouldn't go much higher off Junior this close to the sun."  "But if we go beyond the two-hour limit, the _Polaris_ can't blast off either," commented Roger dryly.  "All right. Is everything set?" asked Connel. "Astro, is the reactant loaded?"  "No, sir," said Astro, "but it's all ready to go in."  "Good!" said Connel. "Now we all know how important--and how dangerous--this operation is. I don't have to tell you again. You stay here on the control deck, Tom, and keep in touch with us on Junior at all times. You know what to do?"  "Yes, sir," replied Tom. "I'm to stand by and give you a minute-by-minute warning check until final blast-off time."  "Right," said Connel. "And remember, we're counting on you to tell us when to blast off. We'll be too busy down there to pay any attention."  "I understand, sir," replied Tom. His face was passive. He was well aware of the responsibility.  "Very well," said Connel finally, "the rest of you board your jet boats! This is going to be the hottest ride we'll ever take, and I don't want it to get any hotter!"  Silently, their faces grim masks, the five spacemen filed out of the control room, leaving Tom alone. Presently he heard the cough of the rockets in the jet boats as one by one the small space craft blasted out of the _Polaris_. Suddenly Tom began to shake as he realized the importance of his task--the responsibility of counting time for five men, time that could cost them their lives. If he made a single mistake, miscounted by a minute, the expedition to Junior would end not only in failure, but in tragedy.  As quickly as the thought came, Tom pushed it aside and turned to the control board. No time now for fear. Now, more than any other time in his life, he had to keep himself alert and ready for every emergency. As a child he had often dreamed of the day when, as a spaceman, he would be faced with an emergency only he could handle. And in the dreams he had come through with flying colors. But now that it was a reality, Tom felt nothing but cold sweat breaking out on his forehead.  He turned his whole attention to the great solar clock overhead. Time had already begun slipping away. Ten minutes of the two hours had swept past. They must be on Junior by now, he thought, and flipped on the teleceiver. He focused on the satellite's surface. There in front of him were the three jet boats. Major Connel, Roger, Astro, Alfie, and Mr. Shinny were so close that Tom felt as though he could touch them. They were unloading the first reactor unit, with Astro and Shinny digging the hole. Tom glanced at the clock, turned to the microphone, and announced clearly:  "Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour and forty-eight minutes until blast-off time--one hour and forty-eight minutes to blast-off."  He flipped the switch and watched the screen with rising excitement. The crew on the satellite had completed the installation of the first reactor unit. He saw them blasting off in their jet boats for the second spot. He adjusted the teleceiver and tried to follow them, but they disappeared. He glanced at the clock.  "Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour and forty-seven minutes to blast-off--one hour and forty-seven minutes to blast-off."  On the satellite, in the deep shadow of a protecting cliff, each of the five Earthmen paused involuntarily when they heard Tom's warning.  "Forget about the time!" snapped Connel. "By the blessed rings of Saturn, we'll finish this job if it's the last thing we do!"  Connel went to each of the working figures and adjusted the valve, regulating the air-cooling humidity control on their space suits. "Getting pretty hot, eh, boys?" he joked, as he stopped one and then the other to make the delicate adjustment counteracting the heat that was increasing each second they remained on the satellite.  "How hot do you think it is, sir?" asked Roger.  "Never mind the heat," said Connel. "These suits were designed to withstand the temperature of the light side of Mercury! It gets boiling there, so I guess we can stand it here for a while."  One by one, Alfie, Shinny, Roger, and Astro completed their assigned roles, digging the holes, placing the reactors inside, setting the fuse, covering it up, then quickly gathering the equipment, piling back into the three jet boats, and heading for the next point. Landing, they would tumble out of the small space craft almost before the rocket had stopped firing and begin their frantic digging in the hard surface.  [Illustration: _Landing, they would tumble out of the jet boat and begin their frantic digging_]  Over and over, they heard Tom's crisp clear count of time. Five minutes passed, then ten, and before they knew it, a full half-hour of the precious time had vanished. They completed the installation of the second unit and climbed back into the jet boats. The first two units had been buried at points protected from the sun by cliffs, and they had been sheltered from the burning rays.  But, approaching the position for the third reactor unit, Connel searched in vain for some shade. He wasted five precious minutes, scouting an area of several miles, but he could find nothing to protect them on the flat plain.  "Better put in the ultraviolet glass shields in our helmets, boys," he called into the jet-boat communicator. "It's going to be mighty hot, and dangerous."  "Aye, aye, sir," came the replies from the other two jet boats soaring close by.  Roger began refitting their space helmets with the dark glass that would shield them from the strong rays of the enlarging sun.  "Ever been outside in the direct path of the sun with no protection, Roger?" asked Astro.  "No," replied Roger. "Have you?"  "Once," said Astro softly. "On the second moon of Mars, Phobos. I was bucking rockets on the old chemical burners. I was on a freighter called the _Happy Spaceman_. A tube blew on us. Luckily we were close enough to Phobos to make a touchdown, or the leak would have reached the main fuel tanks and blown us clean out to another galaxy."  "What happened?" asked Roger.  "I had to go outside," said Astro. "I was junior rocketman in the crew, so naturally I had to do all the dirty work."  Tom's warning call from the _Polaris_ control deck, tuned to the open communicators of all the jet boats, broke through the loud-speaker.  "Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour and twenty minutes to blast-off time. One hour and twenty minutes to blast-off time."  The two cadets looked at each other as they heard Tom's voice, but neither spoke. Finally Roger asked, "What happened on Phobos?"  "No one bothered to tell me," continued Astro, "that I had to protect myself from the ultraviolet rays of the sun, since Phobos didn't have an atmosphere. It was one of my first hops into space and I didn't know too much. I went outside and began working on the tube. I did the job all right, but for three weeks after, my face was swollen and I couldn't open my eyes. I almost went blind."  Roger grunted and continued to line the clear plastic fish-bowl helmets with the darker protective shields.  Connel's voice rang through the cabin over the communicator: "I guess we'd better go down and get it over with. I don't see anything that will give us any protection down there. Be sure your humidity control is turned up all the way. As soon as you step outside the jet boat, you're going to be hit by a temperature of four hundred degrees!"  "Aye, aye, sir," came Shinny's reply over the intercom. Roger flipped the communicator on and acknowledged the order.  Astro and Shinny followed Connel's jet boat in a long sweeping dive to the surface of the satellite. Stepping out of the air-cooled jet boat onto the torrid unprotected surface of the flat plain was like stepping into a furnace. Even with space suits as protection, the five Earthmen were forced to work in relays in the digging of the hole for the reactor unit.  "Attention! Attention! Corbett to Connel. One hour exactly to blast-off time! One hour--sixty minutes--to blast-off time."  Tom flicked the teleceiver microphone off, and on the teleceiver screen, watched his spacemates work under the broiling sun. They were ahead of time. One hour to complete two more units. Tom allowed himself a sigh of hope and relief. They could still snatch the copper satellite from the powerful pull of the sun.  Suddenly Tom heard a sound behind him and whirled around. His eyes bulged in horror.  "Loring!" he gasped.  "Take your hand off that microphone, Corbett," snarled Loring, "or I'll freeze you!"  "How--how did you get out?" Tom stammered.  "Your buddy, Manning," sneered Loring with a short laugh, "decided he wanted to paste my ears back. So I let him. He was so anxious to make me lose a few teeth that he didn't notice the spoon I kept!"  "Spoon?" asked Tom incredulously.  "Yeah," said Mason, stepping through the door, a paralo-ray gun leveled at Tom. "A few teeth for a spoon. A good trade. We waited for your pals to leave the ship, and then I short-circuited the electronic lock on the brig."  Tom stared at the two men unbelievingly.  "All right, Corbett, get over there to that control board," growled Loring, waving the paralo-ray gun at Tom. "We're going back to Tara."  "Tara?" exclaimed Tom. "But Major Connel and the others--they're--they're down on the satellite. If I don't pick them up, they'll fall into the sun!"  "Well, ain't that too bad," sneered Loring. "Listen to that, Mason. If we don't hang around and pick them up, they'll fall into the sun!"  Mason laughed harshly and advanced toward Tom. "I only got one regret, Corbett. That I can't stay around to see Connel and the Manning punk fry! Now get this wagon outta here, and get it out quick!"  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 19   "Major!" shouted Astro. "Look! The _Polaris_! The _Polaris_ is blasting off!"  The five Earthmen stared up at the silvery spaceship that was rapidly disappearing into the clear blue void of space. Without hesitation, Connel raced for the nearest jet boat and roared into the communicator.  "Corbett! Corbett! Come in, Tom!"  He waited, the silence of the loud-speaker more menacing than anything the spaceman had ever encountered before. Again and again, the Solar Guard officer tried to raise the cadet on the _Polaris_. Finally he turned back to the four crewmen who hovered around the jet boat, hoping against hope.  "Whatever it is," he said, "I'm sure Tom is doing the right thing. We came down here to do a job and we're going to do it! Get moving! We still have to set up the rest of these reactor units."  Without a word, the five men returned to their small ships and followed their commanding officer.  The sun grew larger and the heat more intense with each minute, since each minute brought them almost thirteen hundred miles closer to the sun's blazing surface. With the humidity-control and air-cooling mechanisms in the space suits working at top capacity but affording little relief, Alfie, Roger, Shinny, and Astro buried the fourth reactor unit and headed for the fifth and last emplacement. Occasionally one of them would turn and cast a swift glance at the clear blue space overhead, secretly hoping to find the rocket cruiser had returned. Or, they would strain their ears for Tom's voice counting off the minutes so carefully for them. But they saw nothing and they heard nothing. They concentrated on their jobs, working like demons to complete the installations as planned. They could not stop now and wonder what had happened to the _Polaris_, or even hope for its speedy return. They had a job to do, and they went about it silently, efficiently, and surely.  Astro stood up, the small spade in his hand hanging loosely at his side. He watched Roger and Alfie bring the last of the reactor units from Major Connel's jet boat. They gently lowered it into the hole and stepped back while Shinny, under the watchful eyes of Major Connel, set the fuse. Shinny stepped back, and Astro began covering up the lead box.  "That's it," said Connel. "We're finished!"  What Connel meant was that they were finished with the placement of the reactor units, but he knew immediately that his words had been taken to mean something each felt but had not dared to put into words.  Connel started to correct this misunderstanding but caught himself in time. It would not do, he thought, for him to make excuses for what they knew to be the truth.  "All right, everyone in my jet boat," he snapped. "Astro, you and Roger take all the fuel out of the other boats and pour it into mine. It'll be a tight squeeze, but we can all fit into one craft. No use expending fuel wastefully."  Astro and Roger bent to the task of draining the fuel from their jet boats and loading it into Connel's.  Alfie came over to join them, while Shinny and Connel scanned the sky overhead for some sign of the _Polaris_.  "This is really a desperate situation to be in, isn't it, Roger?" asked Alfie.  "Offhand, I'd say yes," drawled Roger, "but since we've got two big huskies like Astro and Major Connel along, I don't think we'll have much trouble."  "Why not?" asked Alfie.  "We'll just let them get out and help push!"  "And if that doesn't work," snorted Astro, "we'll stick Manning outside and let him talk about himself. That oughta give us enough gas to get us away from this hunk of copper."  "I believe," said Alfie emphatically, "that you're joshing me, Manning."  "Now, whatever gave you that idea?" asked Roger in a hurt tone.  "This _is_ a serious situation, isn't it?" asked Alfie, looking at Astro.  "It sure is, Alfie," said Astro soberly, "and I'm the first one to say I'm a little scared!"  Alfie smiled. "I'm very glad you said that, Astro," he said, "because I feel exactly the same way!" He turned and walked back to Major Connel.  "What was the idea of telling him that?" hissed Roger at Astro. "What are you trying to do? Get the little guy space happy, or something?"  "Look at him!" said Astro. "I'm twice his size. He figures if a big guy like me is scared, then he's got a right to be scared too!"  Roger grunted in appreciation of the way Astro had treated Alfie's fears and turned back to the loading of the fuel.  Major Connel walked over and watched them transfer the last of the fuel into the tanks.  "How much have you got there, Astro?" he asked.  "I'd say enough to sustain flight for about three hours, sir. Considering we'll have such a big load."  "Ummmmh," mused Connel. "You know we're up against big odds, don't you?"  Roger and Astro nodded.  "If Tom doesn't come back soon, we'll be so far into the pull of the sun, even a ship the size of the _Polaris_ wouldn't be able to break out."  "How much time have we got, sir?" asked Roger.  "Not too much, Manning," said Connel. "Of course we can blast off in the jet boat and get up a few hundred miles, in case Tom does come back. Then he won't have to bring the _Polaris_ down here. But if time runs out on us up there, we'll have to come back and take our chance on Junior being blasted out of the sun's grip."  There was a pause while Astro and Roger considered this.  "That would mean," asked Roger, "that we'd be here when the reactor units go off, wouldn't it, sir?"  "That's right, Manning," said Connel, admitting to the danger. "Even if Junior were blasted out of the pull of the sun, we couldn't survive the explosions."  "Couldn't we blast off in the jet boat and then land after the explosions, sir?" asked Astro.  "Yes," admitted Connel, "we could do that. But the radioactivity would be so powerful we couldn't last more than a few days. We have no antiradiation gear. Not even food or water." He paused and scanned the sky. "No," he said in a surprisingly casual voice, "the only way we can get out of this is for Tom to come back and get us."  Shinny and Alfie came over and joined the group around the jet boat. No one said anything. There wasn't anything to say. Each of them felt the heat burning through his space suit. Each felt the same fear tugging at his throat. There was nothing to say. The _Polaris_ was not to be seen; the sky was empty of everything except Alpha Centauri, the great burning mass of gases that once they had all seen only as a quiet twinkling star in the heavens, never dreaming that someday it would be pulling them relentlessly into its molten self.   Tom Corbett had a plan.  He sat at the control board of the great rocket cruiser, apparently watching the needles and gauges on the panel, but his mind was racing desperately. The two-hour deadline had just passed. The great solar clock had swung its red hand past the last second. Only a miracle could save the five men on Junior now. But Tom was not counting on miracles. He was counting on his plan.  "Keep this space wagon driving, Corbett!" ordered Loring from behind him. "Keep them rockets wide open!"  "Listen, Loring," pleaded Tom. "How about giving those fellows a break? If I don't pick them up, they'll all be killed."  "Ain't that too bad," snarled Mason.  "Look," said Tom desperately, "I'll promise you nothing will happen to you. We'll let you go free. We'll--"  Loring cut him off. "Shut your trap and concentrate on them controls! You and Major Connel and them other punks are the only guys between me staying free or going back to a prison asteroid. So you don't think I'm going to let them stay alive, do you?" He grinned crookedly.  "You dirty space crawler!" growled Tom and suddenly leaped up from the control seat.  Loring raised the paralo-ray gun threateningly. "One more move outta you and I'll freeze you so solid you'll think you're a chunk of ice!" he yelled.  Mason stepped to the other side of the control deck. They had Tom blocked on either side.  "Now get back to them controls, Corbett," snarled Loring, "or I'll give it to you right now."  "O.K., Loring, you win," said Tom. He sat down and faced the control panel. He tried hard not to smile. They had fallen for it. Now they were separated. Mason remained on the opposite side of the room. Tom took a deep breath, crossed his fingers, and put the next step of his plan into action. He reached out and pulled the master acceleration switch all the way back. The _Polaris_ jumped ahead as if shot out of a cannon.  "Hey," growled Mason, "what're you doing?"  "You want more speed, don't you?" demanded Tom.  "O.K.," said Mason, "but don't try any funny stuff!"  "I don't see how I can. You've got me nailed with that paralo-ray," Tom replied.  He got up leisurely, so as not to excite the nervous trigger finger of Loring, and turned slowly.  "What is it this time?" demanded Loring.  "I just gave you an extra burst of speed. All the _Polaris_ will take. Now I've got to adjust the mixture of the fuel, otherwise she'll kick out on you and we'll have to clean out the tubes."  "Yeah," sneered Loring. "Well, I happen to know you do that right on the control board." He motioned with the paralo-ray gun. "Get back down!"  "On regular space drive, you do," agreed Tom. "But we're on hyperdrive now. It has to be done there"--he pointed to a cluster of valves and wheels at one side of the control deck--"one of those valve wheels."  "Stay where you are," said Mason. "I'll do it!" He moved to the corner. "Which one is it?" he asked.  Tom gulped and struggled hard to keep the terrible nervousness out of his voice. He had to sound as casual as possible. "The red one. Turn it to the right, hard!" he said.  Loring sat down and Mason bent over the valve wheel. He gave the wheel a vicious twist. Suddenly there was the sound of a motor slowing down somewhere inside the great ship. Tom gripped the edge of the control board and waited. Slowly at first, but surely, Tom felt himself beginning to float off his chair.  "Hey!" yelled Mason. "I'm--I'm floating!"  "It's the gravity generators," yelled Loring. "Corbett's pulled a fast one. We're in free fall!"  Tom lifted his feet and pushed as hard as he could against the control panel. He shot out of the chair and across the control room just as Loring fired his ray gun. There was a loud hiss as the gun was fired, and then the thud of a body against the wall, as Loring was suddenly shoved by the recoil of the charge.  Tom huddled in the upper corner of the control deck like a spider, his legs drawn up underneath him waiting for Mason to fire. But the smaller spaceman was tumbling head over heels in the center of the room. The more he exerted himself, the more helpless he became. His arms and legs splayed out in an effort to level himself, as he kept trying to fire the ray gun.  Tom saw his chance and lunged through the air again, straight at the floating spaceman. He passed him in mid-air. Mason made an attempt to grab him, but Tom wrenched his body to one side and pulled the ray gun out of the other's hand.  He flipped over and turned his attention to Loring who was more dangerous, since he was now backed up against a bulkhead waiting for Tom to present a steady target. Loring started to fire, but Tom saw him in time and shot away from the wall toward the hatch. He twisted his body completely around, and with his shoulder hunched over, fired at Loring with his ray gun. The charge hit the target and Loring became rigid, his body slowly floating above the deck. His back to the wall, braced for the recoil, Tom brought his arm around slowly and aimed at Mason. He fired, and the spaceman stiffened.  Tom smiled. Neither of the spacemen would give him any more trouble now. He pushed slightly to the left and shot over to the valve that Mason had unwittingly turned off. Tom turned it on and clung to an overhead pipe until he felt the reassuring grip of the synthetic gravity pull him to the deck. Loring and Mason, in the same positions they had been in when Tom fired, settled slowly to the deck. Tom walked over and looked at both of them. He knew they could hear him.  "For smart spacemen like you two," said Tom, "you sure forgot your basic physics. Newton's laws of motion, remember? Everything in motion tends to keep going at the same speed, unless influenced by an outside force. Firing the ray gun was the outside force that will land you right on a prison asteroid! And you'd better start praying that I can pull those fellows off that satellite, because if I don't, you'll wind up frying in the sun with us!"  He started to drag them to a locker and release them from the effects of the ray blast, but, remembering their cold-blooded condemnation of Connel and the others to death on the satellite, he decided to let them remain where they were.  He turned to the control board and flipped on the microphone. He was too far away to pick up an image on the teleceiver, but the others could hear him on the audio, if, thought Tom, they were still alive.  "Attention! Attention! _Polaris_ to Major Connel! Major Connel, can you hear me? Come in, Major Connel--Astro--Roger--somebody--come in!"  He turned away from the mike and fired the starboard jets full blast, making a sweeping curve in space and heading the _Polaris_ back to Junior.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 20   "There's only one answer, boys," said Connel. "Loring and Mason have escaped and taken over the ship. I can't think of any other reason Tom would abandon us like this."  The jet boat was crowded. Alfie, the smallest, was sitting on Astro's lap. For more than an hour they had circled above the copper satellite, searching the surrounding skies in vain for some sign of the _Polaris_.  "Major," said Roger, who was hunched over the steering wheel of the small space craft, "we're almost out of fuel. We'd better drop down on the night side of Junior, the side away from the sun. At least there we'd be out of the direct heat."  "Very well, Roger," said Connel. "In fact, we could keep shifting into the night side every hour." Then he added quietly, thoughtfully, "But we're out of fuel, you said?"  "Yes, sir," said Roger. "There's just enough to get down." Roger sent the craft in a shallow dive. Suddenly the rockets cut out. The last of the fuel was gone. Roger glided the jet boat to a smooth stop on the night side of the planetoid.  "How much longer before the reactor units go up?" asked Shinny.  Connel turned, thinking he had heard something on the communicators, then answered Shinny's question. "Only four hours," he said.  The crew of spacemen climbed out of the jet boat into the still blackness of the night side of the planet. There wasn't anything left to do.  They sat around on the hard surface of the planet, staring at the strange stars overhead.  "You know," said Astro, "I might be able to set up something to convert some of the U235 in the reactors to fuel the jet boat."  "Impossible, Astro," said Alfie. "You'd need a reduction gear. And not only that, but you haven't any tools to handle the mass. If you opened one of those boxes, you'd be fried immediately by the radiation!"  "Alfie's right," said Connel. "There's nothing to do but wait."  Major Connel turned his face up as far as he could in the huge fish-bowl helmet to stare at the sky. His eyes wandered from star cluster to star cluster, from glowing Regulus, to bright and powerful Sirius. He stifled a sigh. How much he had wanted to see more--and more--and more of the great wide, high, and deep! He remembered his early days as a youth on his first trip to Luna City; his first sensation at touching an alien world; his skipper, old, wise, and patient, who had given him his creed as a spaceman: "Travel wide, deep, and high," the skipper had said to the young Connel, "but never so far, so wide, or so deep as to forget that you're an Earthman, or how to act like an Earthman!" Even now, years later, the gruff voice rang in his ears. It wasn't long after that that he had met Shinny. Connel smiled behind the protection of his helmet, as he looked at the wizened spaceman, who was now old and toothless, but who still had the same merry twinkle in his eye that Connel had noticed the first time he saw him. Connel had signed on as first officer on a deep spacer bound for Titan. Shinny had come aboard and reported to Connel as rocketman. Shinny had promptly started roaring through the passageways of the huge freighter in his nightshirt singing snatches of old songs at the top of his voice. It had taken Connel four hours to find where Shinny had hidden the bottle of rocket juice! Connel laughed. He looked over at the old man fondly.  [Illustration]  "Say, Nick," said Connel, addressing the man by his given name for the first time, "you remember the time it took me four hours to find that bottle of rocket juice you hid on that old Titan freighter?"  Shinny cackled, his thin voice coming over the headphones of the others as well as Connel's.  "I sure do, Lou!" replied Shinny, using Connel's first name. They were just old spacemen now, reliving old times together. "Funny thing, though, you never knew I had two more bottles hidden in the tube chamber!"  "Why, you old space crawler!" roared Connel. "You put one over on me!"  [Illustration]  Roger and Astro and Alfie had never known Connel's first name. They rolled the name over in their minds, fitting the name to the man. Unknown to each other, they decided that the name fitted the man. Lou Connel!  "Say, Lou," asked Shinny, "where in the blessed universe did you come from? You never told me."  There was a long pause. "A place called Telfair Estates, in the deep South on the North American continent. I was raised on a farm close by. I used to go fishing late at night and stare up at the stars." He paused again. "I ran away from home. I don't know if--if--anyone's still there or not. I never went back!"  There was a long silence as each man saw a small boy fishing late at night, barefoot, his toes dangling in the water, a worm wiggling on the end of a string, more interested in the stars that twinkled overhead than in any fish that might swim past and seize the hook.  "Where are you from, Nick?" asked Connel.  "Born in space," cackled Shinny, "on a passenger freighter carrying colonists out to Titan. Never had a breath of natural fresh air until I was almost a grown man. Nothing but synthetic stuff under the atmosphere screens. My father was a mining engineer. I was the only kid. One night a screen busted and nearly everybody suffocated or froze to death. My pa and ma was among 'em. I blasted off after that. Been in the deep ever since. And you know, by the blessed rings of Saturn, I'd be on a nice farm near Venusport, living on a pension, if you hadn't kicked me out of the Solar Guard!"  "Why, you broken down old piece of space junk," roared Connel, "I oughta--" Connel never finished what he was going to say.  "Attention! Attention! Roger--Astro--Major Connel--come in, please! This is Tom on the _Polaris_!"  As if they had been struck by a bolt of lightning, the five spacemen sat up and then raced to the jet boat.  "Connel to Corbett!" roared the major. "Where are you? What happened?"  "I haven't got time to explain now, sir," said Tom. "Loring and Mason escaped and forced me to take them to Tara. I managed to overcome them and blast back here. Meet me up about fifty miles above Junior, sir. I'm bringing the _Polaris_ in!"  "No!" yelled Connel. "It's no use, Tom. We're out of fuel. We've used up all our power."  "Then stand by," said Tom grimly. "I'm coming in for a landing!"  "No, Tom!" roared Connel. "There's nothing you can do. We're too far into the sun's pull. You'll never blast off again!"  "I don't care if we all wind up as cinders," said Tom, "I'm coming in!"  The communicator went dead and from the left, over the close horizon of the small satellite, the _Polaris_ swept into view like a red-tailed fire dragon. It shot up in a pretouchdown maneuver, and then began to drop slowly to the surface of the planetoid.  No sooner had the _Polaris_ touched the dry airless ground than the air-lock hatch was opened. From the crystal port on the control deck, Tom waved to the men below him.  Shinny climbed into the lock first, followed by Astro, Alfie, Roger, and Connel. While Roger and Alfie closed the hatch, Astro and Connel adjusted the oxygen pressure and waited for the supply to build to normal. At last the hissing stopped, and the hatch to the inner part of the ship opened. Tom greeted them with a smile and an outstretched hand.  "Glad to have you aboard!" he joked.  After the back slapping between Roger, Astro, and Tom was over, Connel questioned Tom on his strange departure from the satellite.  "It was just like I told you, sir," explained Tom. "They got out of the brig," he paused, not mentioning the spoon that Loring had used or how he had gotten it. "They forced me to take them to Tara. I managed to get the gravity turned off and gave them a lesson in free-fall fighting. They're still frozen stiff up on the control deck."  "Good boy!" said Connel. "I'll go and have a talk with them. Meantime, Astro, you and Shinny and Alfie get below and see how much fuel we have in emergency supply. We're going to need every ounce we have."  "Aye, aye, sir," said Astro. The three hurried to the power deck.  Connel followed Roger and Tom to the control deck. Loring and Mason were still in the positions they were in when Tom had fired his paralo-ray. Connel took Tom's gun and switched to the neutralizer. He fired twice and the two men rose shakily to their feet. Connel faced them, his eyes burning.  "I'm going to say very little to you two space-crawling rats!" snapped Connel. "I'm not going to lock you in the brig; I'm not going to confine you in any manner. But if you make one false move, I'll court-martial you right here and now! You've caused enough trouble with your selfishness, jeopardizing the lives of six men. If we fail to get off this satellite, it'll be because _you_ put us in this position. Now get below and see what aid you can give Astro. And if either of you so much as raises your voice, I'm going to let _him_ take care of you! Is that clear?"  "Yes, sir!" mumbled Loring. "We understand, sir. And we'll do everything we can to--to--make up for what we've done."  "The only thing you can do is to stay out of my sight!" said Connel coldly.  Loring and Mason scuttled past Connel and climbed down to the power deck.  "Attention! Attention! Control deck--Major Connel! Sir, this is Roger on the radar bridge. I just checked over Tom's figures on thrust, sir, and I'm not sure, but I think we've passed the point of safety."  "Thanks, Roger," said Connel. He turned to the intercom. "Power deck, check in!"  "Power deck, aye," said Astro.  "Loring and Mason there?" asked Connel.  "Yes, sir. I'm putting them right to work in the radiation chamber, sir. I'm piling all emergency fuel into the reaction chambers to try for one big push!"  "Why?" asked Connel.  "I heard what Roger said, sir," replied Astro. "This'll give us enough thrust to clear the sun's gravity, but there's something else that might not take it."  "What?" asked Connel.  "The cooling pumps, sir," said Astro. "They may not be able to handle a load as hot as this. We might blow up."  Connel considered this a moment. "Do what you can, Astro. I have absolute faith in you."  "Aye, aye, sir," said Astro. "And thank you. If this wagon holds together, I'll get her off."  Connel turned to Tom who stood ready at the control panel.  "All set, sir," said Tom. "Roger's given me a clear trajectory forward and up. All we need is Astro's push!"  "Unless Astro can build enough pressure in those cooling pumps to handle the overload of reactant fuel, we're done for. We'll get off this moon in pieces!"  "Power deck to control deck."  "Come in, Astro," said Tom.  "Almost ready, Tom," said Astro. "Maximum pressure is eight hundred and we're up to seven seventy now."  "Very well, Astro," replied Connel. "Let her build all the way to an even eight hundred and blast at my command."  "Aye, aye, sir," said Astro.  The mighty pumps on the power deck began their piercing shriek. Higher and higher they built up the pressure, until the ship began to rock under the strain.  "Stand by, Tom," ordered Connel, "and if you've ever twisted those dials, twist them now!"  "Yes, sir," replied Tom.  "Pressure up to seven ninety-one, sir," reported Astro.  "Attention! All members strap into acceleration cushions!"  One by one, Shinny and Alfie, Loring and Mason, Astro and Roger strapped themselves into the acceleration cushions. Roger set the radar scanner and strapped himself in on the radar bridge. Connel slumped into the second pilot's chair and took over the controls of the ship, strapping himself in, while Tom beside him did the same. The whine of the pumps was now a shrill whistle that drowned out all other sounds, and the great ship bucked under the force of the thrust building in her heart.  In front of the power-deck control panel Astro watched the pressure gauge mount steadily.  "Pressure up to seven ninety-six, sir," he called.  "Stand by to fire all rockets!" roared Connel.  "Make it good, you Venusian clunk," yelled Roger.  "Seven ninety-nine, sir!" bellowed Astro.  Astro watched the gauge of the pressure creep slowly toward the eight-hundred mark. In all his experience he had never seen it above seven hundred. Shinny, too, his merry eyes shining bright, watched the needle jerk back and forth and finally reach the eight-hundred mark.  "Eight hundred, sir," bellowed Astro.  "Fire all stern rockets!" roared Connel.  Astro threw the switch. On the control board, Connel saw a red light flash on. He jammed the master switch down hard.  It was the last thing he remembered.  [Illustration]     CHAPTER 21   Tom stirred. He rolled his head from side to side. His mouth was dry and there was a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach. He opened his eyes and stared at the control panel in front of him. Instinctively he began to check the dials and gauges. He settled on one and waited for his pounding heart to return to normal. His eyes cleared, and the gauge swam into view. He read the figures aloud:  "Distance in miles since departure--fourteen thousand, five hundred ..."  Something clicked. He let out a yell.  "We made it! We made it!" He turned and began to pound Connel on the back. "Major Connel! Major, wake up, sir! We made it. We're in free fall! Junior's far behind us!"  "Uh--ah--what--Tom? What?" Connel said, rolling his eyes. In all his experience he had never felt such acceleration. He glanced at the gauge.  "Distance," he read, "fifteen thousand miles." The gauge ticked on.  "We made it, sir!" said Tom. "Astro gave us a kick in the pants we'll never forget!"  Connel grinned at Tom's excitement. There was reason to be excited. They were free. He turned to the intercom, but before he could speak, Astro's voice roared into his ears.  "Report from the power deck, sir," said Astro. "Acceleration normal. Request permission to open up on hyperdrive."  "Permission granted!" said Connel.  "Look, sir," said Tom, "on the teleceiver screen. Junior is getting his bumps!"  Connel glanced up at the screen. One by one the white puffs of dust from the reactor units were exploding on the surface of the planetoid. Soon the whole satellite was covered with the radioactive cloud.  "I'm sure glad we're not on that baby now," whispered Tom.  "Same here, spaceman!" said Connel.   It was evening of the first full day after leaving Junior before the routine of the long haul back to Space Academy had begun. The _Polaris_ was on automatic control, and everyone was assembled in the messroom.  "Well, boys," said Connel, "our mission is a complete success. I've finished making out a report to Space Academy, and everything's fine. Incidentally, Manning," he continued, "if you're worried about having broken your word when you escaped from the space station, forget it. You more than made up for it by your work in helping us get Loring and Mason."  Roger smiled gratefully and gulped, "Thank you, sir."  Loring and Mason, who had eaten their meal separately from the others, listened silently. Loring got up and faced them. The room became silent.  Loring flushed.  [Illustration: _"I know we're going to be sent to the prison asteroid and we deserve it," said Loring._]  "I'd like to say something," he began haltingly, "if I can?"  "Go ahead," said Connel.  "Well," said Loring, "it's hard to say this, but Mason and myself, well--" He paused. "I don't know what happened to us on the first trip out here, Major, but when we saw that satellite, and the copper, something just went wrong inside. One thing led to another, and before we knew it, we were in so deep we couldn't get out."  The faces around the table were stony, expressionless.  "Nobody deserves less consideration than me and Mason. And--well, you know yourself, sir, that we were pretty good spacemen at one time. You picked us for the first trip out to Tara with you."  Connel nodded.  "And well, sir, the main thing is about Jardine and Bangs. I know we're going to be sent to the prison asteroid and we deserve it. But we been thinking, sir, about Jardine's and Bang's wives and kids. They musta lost everything in that crash of the _Annie Jones_, so if the major would recommend that Mason and me be sent to the Titan mines, instead of the rock, we could send our credits back to help take care of the kids and all."  No one spoke.  "That's all," said Loring. He and Mason left the room.  Connel glanced around the table. "Well?" he asked. "This is your first struggle with justice. Each of you, Tom, Roger, Astro, Alfie, will be faced with this sort of thing during your careers as spacemen. What would you do?"  The four cadets looked at each other, each wondering what the other would say. Finally Connel turned to Alfie.  "You're first, Alfie," said Connel.  "I'd send them to the mines, sir," said Alfie.  Connel's face was impressive. "Roger?"  "Same here, sir," replied Roger.  "Astro?" asked Connel.  "I'd do anything to help the kids, sir," said Astro, an orphan himself.  "Tom?"  Tom hesitated. "They deserve the rock, sir. I don't have any feeling for them. But if they go to the rock, that doesn't do any more than punish them. If they go to the mines, they'll be punished and help someone else too. I'd send them to Titan and exile them from Earth forever."  Connel studied the cadets a moment. He turned to Shinny.  "Think they made a good decision, Nick?"  "I like what young Tommy, here, had to say, Lou," answered Shinny. "Best part about justice is when the man himself suffers from his own guilty feelings, rather than what you do to him as punishment. I think they did all right!"  "All right," said Connel. "I'll make the recommendation as you have suggested." Suddenly he turned to Shinny. "What about you in all this, Nick? I don't mean that you were hooked up with Loring and Mason. I know you were just prospecting and you've proved yourself to be a true spaceman. But what will happen to you now?"  "I'll tell you what's going to happen to me," snapped Shinny. "You're going to re-enlist me in the Solar Guard, right here! Right now!"  "What?" exploded Connel.  "And then you're going to retire me, right here, right now, with a full pension!"  "Why you old space-crawling--" Suddenly he looked around the table and saw the laughing faces of Tom, Roger, Astro, and Alfie.  "All right," he said, "but between your enlistment and your retirement, I'm going to make you polish every bit of brass on this space wagon, from the radar mast to the exhaust tubes!"  Shinny smiled his toothless smile and looked at Tom.  "Get the logbook, Tommy," he said. "This is official. I'm going to do something no other man in the entire history of the Solar Guard ever did before!"  "What's that, Mr. Shinny?" asked Tom with a smile.  "Enlist, serve time, and retire with a full pension, all on the same blasted spaceship, the _Polaris_!"GALAXIES IN THE BALANCE  The famous scientific trio of Arcot, Wade and Morey, challenged by the most ruthless aliens in all the universes, blasted off on an intergalactic search for defenses against the invaders of Earth and all her allies.  World after world was visited, secret after secret unleashed, and turned to mighty weapons of intense force--and still the Thessian enemy seemed to grow in power and ferocity.  Mighty battles between huge space armadas were but skirmishes in the galactic war, as the invincible aliens savagely advanced and the Earth team hurled bolt after bolt of pure ravening energy--until it appeared that the universe itself might end in one final flare of furious torrential power....     Chapter I  INVADERS   Russ Evans, Pilot 3497, Rocket Squad Patrol 34, unsnapped his seat belt, and with a slight push floated "up" into the air inside the weightless ship. He stretched himself, and yawned broadly.  "Red, how soon do we eat?" he called.  "Shut up, you'll wake the others," replied a low voice from the rear of the swift little patrol ship. "See anything?"  "Several million stars," replied Evans in a lower voice. "And--" His tone became suddenly severe. "Assistant Murphy, remember your manners when addressing your superior officer. I've a mind to report you."  A flaming head of hair topping a grinning face poked around the edge of the door. "Lower your wavelength, lower your wavelength! You may think you're a sun, but you're just a planetoid. But what I'd like to know, Chief Pilot Russ Evans, is why they locate a ship in a forlorn, out of the way place like this--three-quarters of a billion miles, out of planetary plane. No ships ever come out here, no pirates, not a chance to help a wrecked ship. All we can do is sit here and watch the other fellows do the work."  "Which is exactly why we're here. Watch--and tell the other ships where to go, and when. Is that chow ready?" asked Russ looking at a small clock giving New York time.  "Uh--think she'll be on time? Come on an' eat."  Evans took one more look at the telectroscope screen, then snapped it off. A tiny, molecular towing unit in his hand, he pointed toward the door to the combined galley and lunch room, and glided in the wake of Murphy.  "How much fuel left?" he asked, as he glided into the dizzily spinning room. A cylindrical room, spinning at high speed, causing an artificial "weight" for the foods and materials in it, made eating of food a less difficult task. Expertly, he maneuvered himself to the guide rail near the center of the room, and caught the spiral. Braking himself into motion, he soon glided down its length, and landed on his feet. He bent and flexed his muscles, waiting for the now-busied assistant to get to the floor and reply.  "They gave us two pounds extra. Lord only knows why. Must expect us to clean up on some fleet. That makes four pound rolls left, untouched, and two thirds of the original pound. We've been here fifteen days, and have six more to go. The main driving power rolls have about the same amount left, and three pound rolls in each reserve bin," replied Red, holding a curiously moving coffee pot that strove to adjust itself to rapidly changing air velocities as it neared the center of the room.  "Sounds like a fleet's power stock. Martian lead or the terrestrial isotope?" asked Evans, tasting warily a peculiar dish before him. "Say, this is energy food. I thought we didn't get any more till Saturday." The change from the energy-less, flavored pastes that made up the principal bulk of a space-pilot's diet, to prevent over-eating, when no energy was used in walking in the weightless ship, was indeed a welcome change.  "Uh-huh. I got hungry. Any objections?" grinned the Irishman.  "None!" replied Evans fervently, pitching in with a will.  Seated at the controls once more, he snapped the little switch that caused the screen to glow with flashing, swirling colors as the telectroscope apparatus came to life. A thousand tiny points of flame appeared scattered on a black field with a suddenness that made them seem to snap suddenly into being. Points, tiny dimensionless points of light, save one, a tiny disc of blue-white flame, old Sol from a distance of close to one billion miles, and under slight reverse magnification. The skillful hands at the controls were turning adjustments now, and that disc of flame seemed to leap toward him with a hundred light-speeds, growing to a disc as large as a dime in an instant, while the myriad points of the stars seemed to scatter like frightened chickens, fleeing from the growing sun, out of the screen. Other points, heretofore invisible, appeared, grew, and rushed away.  The sun shifted from the center of the screen, and a smaller reddish-green disc came into view--a planet, its atmosphere coloring the light that left it toward the red. It rushed nearer, grew larger. Earth spread as it took the center of the screen. A world, a portion of a world, a continent, a fragment of a continent as the magnification increased, boundlessly it seemed.  Finally, New York spread across the screen; New York seen from the air, with a strange lack of perspective. The buildings did not seem all to slant toward some point, but to stand vertical, for, from a distance of a billion miles, the vision lines were practically parallel. Titanic shafts of glowing color in the early summer sun appeared; the hot rays from the sun, now only 82,500,000 miles away, shimmering on the colored metal walls.  The new Airlines Building, a mile and a half high, supported at various points by actual spaceship driving units, was a riot of shifting, rainbow hues. A new trick in construction had been used here, and Evans smiled at it. Arcot, inventor of the ship that carried him, had suggested it to Fuller, designer of that ship, and of that building. The colored berylium metal of the wall had been ruled with 20,000 lines to the inch, mere scratches, but nevertheless a diffraction grating. The result was amazingly beautiful. The sunlight, split up to its rainbow colors, was reflected in millions of shifting tints.  In the air, supported by tiny packs strapped to their backs, thousands of people were moving, floating where they wished, in any direction, at any elevation. There were none of the helicopters of even five years ago, now. A molecular power suit was far more convenient, cost nothing to operate, and but $50 to buy. Perfectly safe, requiring no skill, everyone owned them. To the watcher in space, they were mere moving, snaky lines of barely distinguishable dots that shivered and seemed to writhe in the refractions of the air. Passing over them, seeming to pass almost through them in this strange perspectiveless view, were the shadowy forms of giant space liners, titanic streamlined hulls. They were streamlined for no good reason, save that they looked faster and more graceful than the more efficient spherical freighters, just as passenger liners of two centuries earlier, with their steam engines, had carried four funnels and used two. A space liner spent so minute a portion of its journey in the atmosphere that it was really inefficient to streamline them.  "Won't be long!" muttered Russ, grinning cheerily at the familiar, sunlit city. His eyes darted to the chronometer beside him. The view seemed to be taken from a ship that was suddenly scudding across the heavens like a frightened thing, as it ran across from Manhattan Island, followed the Hudson for a short way, then cut across into New Jersey, swinging over the great woodland area of Kittatiny Park, resting finally on the New Jersey suburb of New York nestled in the Kittatinies, Blairtown. Low apartment buildings, ten or twelve stories high, nestled in the waving green of trees in the old roadways. When ground traffic ceased, the streets had been torn up, and parkways substituted.  Quickly the view singled out a single apartment, and the great smooth roof was enlarged on the screen to the absolute maximum clarity, till further magnification simply resulted in worse stratospheric distortion. On the broad roof were white strips of some material, making a huge V followed by two I's. Russ watched, his hand on the control steadying the view under the Earth's complicated orbital motion, and rotation, further corrections for the ship's orbital motion making the job one requiring great skill. The view held the center with amazing clarity. Something seemed to be happening to the last of the I's. It crumpled suddenly, rolled in on itself and disappeared.  "She's there, and on time," grinned Russ happily.  He tried more magnification. Could he--  He was tired, terribly, suddenly tired. He took his hands from the viewplate controls, relaxed, and dropped off to sleep.  "What made me so tired--wonder--GOD!" He straightened with a jerk, and his hands flew to the controls. The view on the machine suddenly retreated, flew back with a velocity inconceivable. Earth dropped away from the ship with an apparent velocity a thousand times that of light; it was a tiny ball, a pinpoint, gone, the sun--a minute disc--gone--then the apparatus was flashing views into focus from the other side of the ship. The assistant did not reply. Evans' hands were growing ineffably heavy, his whole body yearned for sleep. Slowly, clumsily he pawed for a little stud. Somehow his hand found it, and the ship reeled suddenly, little jerks, as the code message was flung out in a beam of such tremendous power that the sheer radiation pressure made it noticeable. Earth would be notified. The system would be warned. But light, slow crawling thing, would take hours to cross the gulf of space, and radio travels no faster.  Half conscious, fighting for his faculties with all his will, the pilot turned to the screen. A ship! A strange, glistening thing streamlined to the nth degree, every spare corner rounded till the resistance was at the irreducible minimum. But, in the great pilotport of the stranger, the patrol pilot saw faces, and gasped in surprise as he saw them! Terrible faces, blotched, contorted. Patches of white skin, patches of brown, patches of black, blotched and twisted across the faces. Long, lean faces, great wide flat foreheads above, skulls strangely squared, more box-like than man's rounded skull. The ears were large, pointed tips at the top. Their hair was a silky mane that extended low over the forehead, and ran back, spreading above the ears, and down the neck.  Then, as that emotion of surprise and astonishment weakened his will momentarily, oblivion came, with what seemed a fleeting instant of memories. His life seemed to flash before his mind in serried rank, a file of events, his childhood, his life, his marriage, his wife, an image of smiling comfort, then the years, images of great and near great men, his knowledge of history, pictures of great war of 2074, pictures of the attackers of the Black Star--then calm oblivion, quiet blankness.  The long, silent ship that had hovered near him turned, and pointed toward the pinhead of matter that glowed brilliantly in the flaming jewel box of the heavens. It was gone in an instant, rushing toward Sun and Earth at a speed that outraced the flying radio message, leaving the ship of the Guard Patrol behind, and leaving the Pilot as he leaves our story.     Chapter II  CANINE PEOPLE   "And that," said Arcot between puffs, "will certainly be a great boon to the Rocket Patrol, you must admit. They don't like dueling with these space-pirates using the molecular rays, and since molecular rays have such a tremendous commercial value, we can't prohibit the sale of ray apparatus. Now, if you will come into the 'workshop,' Fuller, I'll give a demonstration with friend Morey's help."  The four friends rose, Morey, Wade and Fuller following Arcot into his laboratory on the thirty-seventh floor of the Arcot Research Building. As they went, Arcot explained to Fuller the results and principles of the latest product of the ingenuity of the "Triumvirate," as Arcot, Morey and Wade had come to be called in the news dispatches.  "As you know, the molecular rays make all the molecules of any piece of matter they are turned upon move in the desired direction. Since they supply no new energy, but make the body they are turned upon supply its own, using the energy of its own random molecular motion of heat, they are practically impossible to stop. The energy necessary for molecular rays to take effect is so small that the usual type of filter lets enough of it pass. A ship equipped with filters is no better off when attacked than one without. The rays simply drove the front end into the rear, or _vice versa_, or tore it to pieces as the pirates desired. The Rocket Patrol could kill off the pirates, but they lost so many men in the process, it was a Phyrric victory.  "For some time Morey and I have been working on something to stop the rays. Obviously it can't be by means of any of the usual metallic energy absorption screens.  "We finally found a combination of rays, better frequencies, that did what we wanted. I have such an apparatus here. What we want you to do, of course, is the usual job of rearranging the stuff so that the apparatus can be made from dies, and put into quantity production. As the Official Designer for the A.A.L. you ought to do that easily." Arcot grinned as Fuller looked in amazement at the apparatus Arcot had picked up from the bench in the "workshop."  "Don't get worried," laughed Morey, "that's got a lifting unit combined--just a plain ordinary molecular lift such as you see by the hundreds out there." Morey pointed through the great window where thousands of those lift units were carrying men, women and children through the air, lifting them hundreds, thousands of feet above the streets and through the doors of buildings.  "Here's an ordinary molecular pistol. I'm going to put the suit on, and rise about five feet off the floor. You can turn the pistol on me, and see what impression it makes on the suit."  Fuller took the molecular ray pistol, while Wade helped Arcot into the suit. He looked at the pistol dubiously, pointed it at a heavy casting of iron resting in one corner of the room, and turned the ray at low concentration, then pressed the trigger-button. The casting gave out a low, scrunching grind, and slid toward him with a lurch. Instantly he shut off the power. "This isn't any ordinary pistol. It's got seven or eight times the ordinary power!" he exclaimed.  "Oh yes, I forgot," Morey said. "Instead of the fuel battery that the early pistols used, this has a space-distortion power coil. This pistol has as much power as the usual A-39 power unit for commercial work."  By the time Morey had explained the changes to Fuller, Arcot had the suit on, and was floating five or six feet in the air, like a grotesque captive balloon. "Ready, Fuller?"  "I guess so, but I certainly hope that suit is all it is claimed to be. If it isn't--well I'd rather not commit murder."  "It'll work," said Arcot. "I'll bet my neck on that!" Suddenly he was surrounded by the faintest of auras, a strange, wavering blue light, like the hazy corona about a 400,000-volt power line. "Now try it."  Fuller pointed the pistol at the floating man and pushed the trigger. The brilliant blue beam of the molecular ray, and the low hum of the air, rushing in the path of the director beam, stabbed out toward Arcot. The faint aura about him was suddenly intensified a million times till he floated in a ball of blue-white fire. Scarcely visible, the air about him blazed with bluish incandescence of ionization.  "Increase the power," suggested Morey. Fuller turned on more power. The blue halo was shot through with tiny violet sparks, the sharp odor of ozone in the air was stifling; the heat of wasted energy was making the room hotter. The power increased further, and the tiny sparks were waving streamers, that laced across the surface of the blue fire. Little jets of electric flame reached out along the beam of the ray now. Finally, as full power of the molecular ray was reached, the entire halo was buried under a mass of writhing sparks that seemed to leap up into the air above the man's head, wavering up to extinction. The room was unbearably hot, despite the molecular ray coolers absorbing the heat of the air, and blowing cooled air into the room.  Fuller snapped off the ray, and put the pistol on the table beside him. The halo died, and went out a moment later, and Arcot settled to the floor.  "This particular suit will stand up against anything the ordinary commercial sets will give. The system now: remember that the rays are short electrical waves. The easiest way to stop them is to interpose a wave of opposite phase, and cause interference. Fine, but try to get in tune with an unknown wave when it is moving in relation to your center of control. It is impossible to do it before you yourself have been rayed out of existence. We must use some system that will automatically, instantly be out of phase.  "The Hall effect would naturally tend to make the frequency of a wave through a resisting medium change, and lengthen. If we can send out a spherical wave front, and have it lengthen rapidly as it proceeds, we will have a wave front that is, at all points, different. Any entering wave would, sooner or later, meet a wave that was half a phase out, no matter what the motion was, nor what the frequency, as long as it lies within the comparatively narrow molecular wave band. What this apparatus, or ray screen, consists of, is a machine generating a spherical wave front of the nature of a molecular wave, but of just too great a frequency to do anything. A second part generates a condition in space, which opposes that wave. After traveling a certain distance, the wave has lengthened to molecular wave type, but is now beyond the machine which generated it, and no longer affects it, or damages it. However, as it proceeds, it continues to lengthen, till eventually it reaches the length of infra-light, when the air quickly absorbs it, as it reaches one of the absorption bands for air molecular waves, and any molecular wave must find its half-wave complement somewhere in that wedge of waves. It does, and is at once choked off, its energy fighting the energy of the ray screen, of course. In the air, however, the screen is greatly helped by the fact that before the half-wave frequency is met in the ray-wedge, the molecular ray is buried in ions, leaving the ray screen little work to do.  "Now your job is to design the apparatus in a form that machines can make automatically. We tried doing it ourselves for the fun of it, but we couldn't see how we could make a machine that didn't need at least two humans to supervise."  "Well," grinned Fuller, "you have it all over me as scientists, but as economic workers--two human supervisors to make one product!"  "All right--we agree. But no, let's see you--Lord! What was that?" Morey started for the door on the run. The building was still trembling from the shock of a heavy blow, a blow that seemed much as though a machine had been wrecked on the armored roof, and a big machine at that. Arcot, a flying suit already on, was up in the air, and darting past Morey in an instant, streaking for the vertical shaft that would let him out to the roof. The molecular ray pistol was already in his hand, ready to pull any beams off unfortunate victims pinned under them.  In a moment he had flashed up through the seven stories, and out to the roof. A gigantic silvery machine rested there, streamlined to perfection, its hull dazzingly beautiful in the sunlight. A door opened, and three tall, lean men stepped from it. Already people were collecting about the ship, flying up from below. Air patrolmen floated up in a minute, and seeing Arcot, held the crowd back.  The strange men were tall, eight feet or more in height. Great, round, soft brown eyes looked in curiosity at the towering multicolored buildings, at the people floating in the air, at the green trees and the blue sky, the yellowish sun.  Arcot looked at their strangely blotched and mottled heads, faces, arms and hands. Their feet were very long and narrow, their legs long and thin. Their faces were kindly; the mottled skin, brown and white and black, seemed not to make them ugly. It was not a disfigurement; it seemed oddly familiar and natural in some reminiscent way.  "Lord, Arcot--queer specimens, yet they seem familiar!" said Morey in an undertone.  "They are. Their race is that of man's first and best friend, the dog! See the brown eyes? The typical teeth? The feet still show the traces of the dog's toe-step. Their nails, not flat like human ones but rounded? The mottled skin, the ears--look, one is advancing."  One of the strangers walked laboriously forward. A lighter world than Earth was evidently his home. His great brown eyes fixed themselves on Arcot's. Arcot watched them. They seemed to expand, grow larger; they seemed to fill all the sky. Hypnotism! He concentrated his mind, and the eyes suddenly contracted to the normal eyes of the stranger. The man reeled back, as Arcot's telepathic command to sleep came, stronger than his own will. The stranger's friends caught him, shook him, but he slept. One of the others looked at Arcot; his eyes seemed hurt, desperately pleading.  Arcot strode forward, and quickly brought the man out of the trance. He shook his head, smiled at Arcot, then, with desperate difficulty, he enunciated some words in English, terribly distorted.  "Ahy wizz tahk. Vokle kohds ron. Tahk by breen."  Distorted as it was, Arcot recognized the meaning without difficulty. "I wish (to) talk. Vocal cords wrong. Talk by brain." He switched to communication by the Venerian method, telepathically, but without hypnotism.  "Good enough. When you attempted to hypnotize me, I didn't known what you wanted. It is not necessary to hypnotize to carry on communication by the method of the second world of this system. What brings you to our system? From what system do you come? What do you wish to say?"  The other, not having learned the Venerian system, had great difficulty in communicating his thoughts, but Arcot learned that they had machines which would make it easier, and the terrestrian invited them into his laboratory, for the crowd was steadily growing.  The three returned to their ship for a moment, coming out with several peculiar headsets. Almost at once the ship started to rise, going up more and more swiftly, as the people cleared a way for it.  Then, in the tiniest fraction of a second, the ship was gone; it shrank to a point, and was invisible in the blue vault of the sky.  "Apparently they intend to stay a while," said Wade. "They are trusting souls, for their line of retreat is cut off. We naturally have no intention of harming them, but they can't know that."  "I'm not so sure," said Arcot. He turned to the apparent leader of the three and explained that there were several stories to descend, and stairs were harder than a flying unit. "Wrap your arms about my legs, when I rise above you, and hold on till your feet are on the floor again," he concluded.  The stranger walked a little closer to the edge of the shaft, and looked down. White bulbs illuminated its walls down its length to the ground. The man talked rapidly to his friends, looking with evident distaste at the shaft, and the tiny pack on Arcot's back. Finally, smiling, he evinced his willingness. Arcot rose, the man grasped his legs, and then both rose. Over the shaft, and down to his laboratory was the work of a moment.  Arcot led them into his "consultation room," where a number of comfortable chairs were arranged, facing each other. He seated them together, and his own friends facing them.  "Friends of another world," began Arcot, "we do not know your errand here, but you evidently have good reason for coming to this place. It is unlikely that your landing was the result of sheer chance. What brought you? How came you to this point?"  "It is difficult for me to reply. First we must be _en rapport_. Our system is not simple as yours, but more effective, for yours depends on thought ideas, not altogether universal. Place these on your heads, for only a moment. I must induce temporary hypnotic coma. Let one try first if you desire." The leader of the visitors held out one of the several headsets they had brought, caplike things, made of laminated metal apparently.  Arcot hesitated, then with a grin slipped it on.  "Relax," came a voice in Arcot's head, a low, droning voice, a voice of command. "Sleep," it added. Arcot felt himself floating down an infinite shaft, on some superflying suit that did not pull at him with its straps, just floating down lightly, down and down and down. Suddenly he reached the bottom, and found to his surprise that it led directly into the room again! He was back. "You are awake. Speak!" came the voice.  Arcot shook himself, and looked about. A new voice spoke now, not the tonelessly melodious voice, but the voice of an individual, yet a mental voice. It was perfectly clear, and perfectly comprehensible. "We have traveled far to find you, and now we have business of the utmost import. Ask these others to let us treat them, for we must do what we can in the least possible time. I will explain when all can understand. I am Zezdon Fentes, First Student of Thought. He who sits on my right is Zezdon Afthen, and he beyond him, is Zezdon Inthel, of Physics and of Chemistry, respectively."  And now Arcot spoke to his friends.  "These men have something of the greatest importance to tell us, it seems. They want us all to hear, and they are in a hurry. The treatment isn't at all annoying. Try it. The man on the extreme right, as we face them, is Zezdon Fentes of Thought, Zezdon apparently meaning something like professor, or 'First Student of.' Those next him are Zezdon Afthen of Physics and Zezdon Inthel of Chemistry."  Zezdon Afthen offered them the headsets, and in a moment everyone present was wearing one. The process of putting them _en rapport_ took very little time, and shortly all were able to communicate with ease.  "Friends of Earth, we must tell our strange story quickly for the benefit of your world as well as ours, and others, too. We cannot so much as annoy. We are helpless to combat them.  "Our world lies far out across the galaxy; even with incalculable velocity of the great swift thing that bore us, three long months have we traveled toward your distant worlds, hoping that at last the Invaders might meet their masters.  "We landed on this roof because we examined mentally the knowledge of a pilot of one of your patrol ships. His mind told us that here we would find the three greatest students of Science of this Solar System. So it was here we came for help.  "Our race has arisen," he continued, "as you have so surely determined from the race you call canines. It was artificially produced by the Ancient Masters when their hour of need had come. We have lost the great science of the Ancient Ones. But we have developed a different science, a science of the mind."  "Dogs are far more psychic than are men. They would naturally tend to develop such a civilization," said Arcot judiciously.     Chapter III  A QUARTER OF A MILLION LIGHT YEARS   "Our civilization," continued Zezdon Afthen, "is built largely on the knowledge of the mind. We cannot have criminals, for the man who plots evil is surely found out by his thoughts. We cannot have lying politicians and unjust rulers.  "It is a peaceful civilization. The Ancient Masters feared and hated War with a mighty aversion. But they did not make our race cowards, merely peaceful intelligence. Now we must fight for our homes, and my race will fight mightily. But we need weapons.  "But my story has little to do with our race. I will tell the story of our civilization and of the Ancient Ones later when the time is more auspicious.  "Four months ago, our mental vibration instruments detected powerful emanations from space. That could only mean that a new, highly intelligent race had suddenly appeared within a billion miles of our world. The directional devices quickly spotted it as emanating from the third planet of our system. Zezdon Fentes, with my aid, set up some special apparatus, which would pick up strong thoughts and make them visible. We had used this before to see not only what an enemy looked upon, but also what he saw in that curious thing, the eye of the mind, the vision of the past and the future. But while the thought-amplification device was powerful, the new emanations were hard to separate from each other.  "It was done finally, when all but one man slept. That one we were enable to tune sharply to. After that we could reach him at any time. He was the commander. We saw him operate the ship, we saw the ship, saw it glide over the barren, rocky surface of that world. We saw other men come in and go out. They were strange men. Short, squat, bulky men. Their arms were short and stocky. But their strength was enormous, unbelievable. We saw them bend solid bars of steel as thick as my arm. With perfect ease!  "Their brains were tremendously active, but they were evil, selfishly evil. Nothing that did not benefit them counted. At one time our instruments went dead, and we feared that the commander had detected us, but we saw what happened a little later. The second in command had killed him.  "We saw them examine the world, working their way across it, wearing heavy suits, yet, for all the terrific gravity of that world, bouncing about like rubber balls, leaping and jumping where they wanted. Their legs would drive out like pistons, and they soared up and through the air.  "They were tired while they made those examinations, and slept heavily at night.  "Then one night there was a conference. We saw then what they intended. Before we had tried desperately to signal them. Now we were glad that we had failed.  "We saw their ship rise (in the thoughts of the second in command) and sail out into space, and rush toward our world. The world grew larger, but it was imperfectly sketched in, for they did not know our world well. Their telescopes did not have great power as your electric telescopes have.  "We saw them investigate the planet. We saw them plan to destroy any people they found with a ray which was as follows: 'the ray which makes all parts move as one.' We could not understand and could not interpret. Thoughts beyond our knowledge have, of course, no meaning, even when our mental amplifiers get them, and bring them to us."  "The Molecular ray!" gasped Morey in surprise. "They will be an enemy."  "You know it! It is familiar to you! You have it? You can fight it?" asked Zezdon Afthen excitedly.  "We know it, and can fight it, if that is all they have."  "They have more--much more I fear," replied Zezdon Afthen. "At any rate, we saw what they intended. If our world was inhabited, they would destroy every one on it, and then other men of their race were to float in on their great ships, and settle on that largest of our worlds.  "We had to stop them so we did what we could. We had powerful machines, which would amplify and broadcast our thoughts. So we broadcast our thought-waves, and implanted in the mind of their leader that it would be wise to land, and learn the extent of the civilization, and the weapons to be met. Also, as the ship drew nearer, we made him decide on a certain spot we had prepared for him.  "He never guessed that the thoughts were not his own. Only the ideas came to him, seeming to spring from his own mind.  "He landed--and we used our one weapon. It was a thing left to one group of rulers when the Ancient Masters left us to care for ourselves. What it was, we never knew; we had never used it in the fifteen thousand years since the Great Masters had passed--never had to. But now it was brought out, and concealed behind great piles of rock in a deep canyon where the ship of the enemy would land. When it landed, we turned the beam of the machine on it, and the apparatus rotated it swiftly, and a cone of the beam's ray was formed as the beam was swung through a small circle in the vertical plane. The machine leaped backward, and though it was so massive that a tremendous amount of labor had been required to bring it there, the push of the pencil of force we sent out hurled it back against a rocky cliff behind it as though it were some child's toy. It continued to operate for perhaps a second, perhaps two. In that time two great holes had been cut in the enemy ship, holes fifteen feet across, that ran completely through the hull as though a die had cut through the metal of the ship, cutting out a disc of metal.  "There was a terrific concussion, and a roar as the air blasted out of the ship. It did not take us long to discover that the enemy were dead. Their terrible, bloated corpses lay everywhere in the ship. Most of the men we were able to recognize, having seen them in the mentovisor. But the colors were distorted, and their forms were peculiar. Indeed, the whole ship seemed strange. The only time that things ever did seem normal about that strange thing, when the angles of it seemed what they were, when the machines did not seem out of proportion, out of shape, twisted, was when on a trial trip we ventured very close to our sun."  Arcot whistled softly and looked at Morey. Morey nodded. "Probably right. Don't interrupt."  "That you thought something, I understood, but the thoughts themselves were hopelessly unintelligible to me. You know the explanation?" asked Zezdon Afthen eagerly.  "We think so. The ship was evidently made on a world of huge size. Those men, their stocky, block legs and arms, their entire build and their desire for the largest of your planets, would indicate that. Their own world was probably even larger--they were forced to wear pressure suits even on that large world, and could jump all over, you said. On so huge a sphere as their native world seems to be, the gravity would be so intense as to distort space. Geometry, such as yours seems to be, and such as ours was, could never be developed, for you assume the existence of a straight line, and of an absolute plane surface. These things cannot exist in space, but on small worlds, far from the central sun's mass, the conditions approach that without sufficient discrepency to make the error obvious. On so huge a globe as their world the space is so curved that it is at once obvious that no straight line exists, and that no plane exists. Their geometry would never be like ours. When you went close to your sun, the attraction was sufficient to curve space into a semblance of the natural conditions on their home planet, then your senses and the ship met a compromise condition which made it seem more or less normal, not so obviously strange to you.  "But continue." Arcot looked at Afthen interestedly.  "There were none left in their ship now, and we had been careful in locating the first hole, that it should not damage the propulsive machinery. The second hole was accidental, due to the shift of the machine. The machine itself was wrecked now, crushed by its own reaction. We forgot that any pencil of force powerful enough to do what we wanted, would tear the machine from its moorings unless fastened with great steel bolts into the solid rock.  "The second hole had been far to the rear, and had, by ill-luck, cut out a portion of the driving apparatus. We could not repair that, though we did succeed at last in lifting the great discs into place. We attempted to cut them, and put them back in sections. Our finest saws and machines did not nick them. Their weight was unbelievable, and yet we finally succeeded in lifting the things into the wall of the ship. The actual missing material did not represent more than a tiny cut, perhaps as wide as one of your credit-discs. You could slip the thin piece of metal in between them, but not so much as your finger.  "Those slots we welded tight with our best steel, letting a flap hang over on each side of the cut, and as the hot metal cooled, it was drawn against the shining walls with terrific force. The joints were perfectly airtight.  "The machines proper were repaired to the greatest possible extent. It was a heartbreaking task, for we must only guess at what machines should be connected together. Much damage had been done by the rushing air as it left, for it filled the machines, too, and they were not designed to resist the terrific air pressure that was on them when the pressure in the ship escaped. Many of the machines had been burst open, and these we could repair when we had the necessary elements and knew their construction from the remnants, or could find unbroken duplicates in the stock rooms.  "Once we connected the wrong things. This will show you what we dealt with. They were the wrong poles--two generators, connected together in the wrong way. There was a terrific crash when the switch was thrown, and huge sheets of electric flame leaped from one of them. Two men were killed, incinerated in an instant, even the odors one might expect were killed in that flash of heat. Everything save the shining metal and clear glass within ten feet of it was instantly wiped out. And there was a fuse link that gave. The generator was ruined. One was left, and several small auxiliary generators.  "Eventually, we did the job. We made the machine work. And we are here.  "We have come to warn you, and to ask aid. Your system also has a large planet, slightly smaller than the largest of our system, but yet attractive. There are approximately 50,000 planetary systems in this universe, according to the records of the Invaders. Their world is not of this system. It is the World Thett, sun Antseck, Universe Venone. Where that is, or even what it means, we do not know. Perhaps you understand.  "But they investigated your world, and its address, according to their records, was World 3769-8482730-3. This, I believe, means, Universe 3769, sun 8482730, world 3. They have been investigating this system now for nearly three centuries. It was close to 200 years ago that they visited your world--two hundred years of your time."  "This is 2129--which makes it about the year 1929-30 that they floated around here investigating. Why haven't they done anything?" Arcot asked him.  "They waited for an auspicious time. They are afraid now, for recently they visited your world, and were utterly amazed to find the unbelievable progress your people have made. They intend to make an immediate attack on all worlds known to be intelligently populated. They had made the mistake of letting one race learn too much; they cannot afford to let it happen again.  "There are only twenty-one inhabited worlds known, and their thousands of scouts have already investigated nearly all the central mass of this universe, and much of the outer rings. They have established a base in this universe. Where I do not know. That, alone, was never mentioned in the records. But of all peoples, they feared only your world.  "There is one race in the universe far older than yours, but they are a sleeping people. Long ago their culture decayed. Still, now they are not far from you, and perhaps it will be worth the few days needed to learn more about them. We have their location and can take you there. Their world circles a dead star--"  "Not any more," laughed Morey grimly. "That's another surprise for the enemy. They had a little jog, and they certainly are wide awake now. They are headed for big things, and they are going to do a lot."  "But how do you know these things? You have ships that can go from planet to planet, I know, but the records of the enemy said you could not leave the system of your sun. They alone knew that secret."  "Another surprise for them," said Morey. "We can--and we can move faster than your ship, if not faster than they. The people of the dead star have moved to a very live star--Sirius, the brightest in our heavens. And they are as much alive now as their new sun. They can move faster than light, also. We had a little misunderstanding a while back, when their star passed close to ours. They came off second best, and we haven't spoken to them since. But I think we can make valuable allies there."  For all Morey's jocular manner, he realized the terrible import of this announcement. A race which had been able to cross the vast gulf of intergalactic space in the days when Terrestrians were still developing the airplane--and already they had mapped Jupiter, and planned their colonies! What developments had come? They had molecular rays, cosmic rays, the energy of matter, then--what else had they now? Lux and Relux, the two artificial metals, made of solidified light, far stronger than anything of molecular structure in nature, absolutely infusible, totally inert chemically, one a perfect conductor of light and of all radiation in space, the other a perfect reflector of all radiations--save molecular rays. Made into the condition of reflection by the action of special frequencies in its formation from light, molecular frequencies were, unfortunately, able to convert it into perfectly transparent lux metal, when the protective value was gone.  They had that. All Earth had, perhaps.  "There was one other race of some importance, the others were semi-civilized. They rated us in a position between these races and the high races--yours, those of the dead star, and those of world 3769-37:478:326:894-6. Our science had been investigated two hundred or so years ago.  "This other race was at a great distance from us, greater than yours, and apparently not feared as greatly as yours. They cannot cross to other worlds, save in small ships driven solely by fire, which the Thessians have called a 'hopelessly inefficient and laughably awkward thing to ride in.'"  "Rockets," grinned Morey. "Our first ship was part rocket."  Zezdon Fentes smiled. "But that is all. We have brought you warning, and our plea. Can you help us?"  "We cannot answer that. The Interplanetary Council must act. But I am afraid that it will be all we can do to protect our own world if this enemy attacks soon, and I fear they will. Since they have a base in this universe, it is impossible to believe that all ships did not report back to the home world at stated intervals. That one is missing will soon be discovered, and it will be sought. War will start at once. Three months it took you to reach us--they should come soon.  "Those men who left will be on their way back from the home world from which they came. What do you call your planet, friend?"  "Ortol is our home," replied Zezdon Inthel.  "At any rate, I can only assure you that your world will be given weapons that will permit your people to defend themselves and I will get you to your home within twenty-four hours. Your ship--is it in the system?"  "It waits on the second satellite of the fourth planet," replied Zezdon Afthen.  "Signal them, and tell them to land where a beacon of intense light, alternating red and blue, reaches up from--this point on the map." Arcot pointed out the spot in Vermont where their private lake and laboratory were.  He turned to the others, and in rapid-fire English, explained his plans. "We need the help of these people as much as they need ours. I think Zezdon Fentes will stay here and help you. The others will go with us to their world. There we shall have plenty of work to do, but on the way we are going to stop at Mars and pick up that valuable ship of theirs and make a careful examination for possible new weapons, their system of speed-drive, and their regular space-drive. I'm willing to make a bet right now, that I can guess both. Their regular drive is a molecular drive with lead disintegration apparatus for the energy, cosmic ray absorbers for the heating, and a drive much like ours. Their speed drive is a time distortion apparatus, I'll wager. Time distinction offers an easy solution of speed. All speed is relative--relative to other bodies, but also to time-speed. But we'll see.  "I'm going to hustle some workmen to installing the biggest spare power board I can get into the storerooms of the _Ancient Mariner_, and pack in a ray-screen. It will be useful. Let's move."  "Our ship," said Zezdon Afthen, "will land in three of your hours."     Chapter IV  THE FIRST MOVE   The Ortolians were standing on a low, green-clad hill. Below them stretched the green flank of the little rise, and beyond lay ridge after ridge of the broad, smooth carpet of the beautiful Vermont hills.  "Man of Earth," said Zezdon Afthen, turning at last to Wade, who stood behind him. "It took us three months of constant flight at a speed unthinkable, through space dotted with the titanic gems of the Outer Dark, stars gleaming in red, and blue and orange, some titanic lighthouses of our course, others dim pinpoints of glowing color. It was a scene of unspeakable grandeur, but it was so awesomely mighty in its scope, one was afraid, and his soul shriveled within him as he looked at those inconceivable masses floating forever alone in the silence of the inconceivable nothingness of eternal cold and eternal darkness. One was awed, suppressed by their sheer magnitude. A magnificent spectacle truly, but one no man could love.  "Now we are at rest on a tiny pinpoint of dust in a tiny bit of a tiny corner of an isolated universe, and the magnitude and stillness is gone. Only the chirpings of those strange birds as they seek rest in darkness, the soft gurgling of the little stream below, and the rustle of countless leaves, break the silence with a satisfying existence, while the loneliness of that great star, your sun, is lost in its tintings of soft color, the fleeciness of the clouds, and the seeming companionship of green hills.  "The beauty of boundless space is awe-inspiring in its magnitude. The beauty of Earth is something man can love.  "Man of Earth, you have a home that you may well fight for with all the strength of your arms, all the forces of your brain, and all the energies of Space that you can call forth to aid you. It is a wondrous world." Silently he stood in the gathering dusk, as first Venus winked into being, then one by one the stars came into existence in the deepening color of the sky.  "Space is awesomely wonderful; this is--lovable." He gazed long at the heavens of this world so strange, so beautiful to him, looking at the unfamiliar heavens, as star after star flashed into the constellations so familiar to terrestrians and to those Venerians who had been above the clouds of Venus' eternal shroud.  "But somewhere off there in space are other races, and far beyond the power of our eyes to see is the star that is the sun of my world, and around it circles that little globe that is home to me. What is happening there now? Does it still exist? Are there people still living on it? Oh, Man of Earth, let us reach that world quickly, you cannot guess the pangs that attack me, for if it be destroyed, think--forever I am without home--without friends I knew. However kind your people may be to me, I would be forever lonely.  "I will not think of that--only it is time your ship was ready, is it not?"  "I think we had better return," replied Wade softly, his English words rousing thoughts in his mind intelligible to the Ortolians.  The three rose in the air on the molecular suits and drove quickly down toward the blue gem of the lake to the east, nestled among still other green hills. Lights were showing in the great shop, where the _Ancient Mariner_ was being fitted with the ray-shields, and all possible weapons. Men streaming through her were hastily stocking her with vast quantities of foods, stocks of fuel, all the spare parts they could cram into her stock rooms.  When the men arrived from the hilltop, the work was practically done, and Wade stepped up to Morey, busily checking off a list of required items.  "Everything you ordered came through?" he asked.  "Yes--thanks to the pull of a two-billion dollar private fortune. Who says credit-units don't have their value? This expedition never would have gotten through, if it hadn't been for that.  "But we have the main space distortion power bank, and the new auxiliary coils full. Ten tons of lead aboard for fuel. There's one thing we are afraid of. If the enemy have a system of tubes that is able to handle more power than our last tube--we're sunk. These brilliant people that suggest using more tubes to a ray-power bank forget the last tube has to handle the entire output of all the others, and modulate it correctly. If the enemy has a better tube--it will be too bad for us." Morey was frankly worried.  "My end is all set, Morey. How soon will you be ready?" Arcot asked.  "'Bout ten-fifteen minutes." Morey lit a cigarette and watched as the last of the stuff was carried aboard.  At last they were ready. The _Ancient Mariner_, originally built for intergalactic exploration, was kept in working condition. New apparatus had been incorporated in it, as their research had led to improvements, and it was constantly in condition, ready for a trip. Many exploration trips to the nearer stars had already been made.  The ship was backed out from the hangar now, and rested on the great smooth landing field, its tremendous quarter million ton mass of lux and relux sinking a great, smooth depression in the turf of the field. They were waiting now for the arrival of the Ortolian ship. Zezdon Afthen assured them it would be there in a few minutes.  High in the sky, came the whining whistle of an approaching ship, coming at terrific velocity. It came nearer the field, darting toward the ground at an unheard of speed, flashing down at a speed of well over three thousand miles an hour, and, only in the last fifty feet slowed with a sickening deceleration. Even so it landed with a crash of fully two hundred miles of speed. Arcot gasped at the terrible landing the pilot had made, fully expecting to see the great hull dent somewhat, even though made of solid relux. And certainly the jar would kill every man on board. Yet the hull did not seem harmed by the crash, and even the ground under the ship was but slightly disturbed, though, at a distance of some thirty feet, the entire block of soil was crushed, and cracked by the terrific impact of hundreds of thousands of tons striking with terrific energy.  "Lord, it's a wonder they didn't kill themselves. I never saw such a rotten landing," exclaimed Morey with disgust.  "Don't be too sure. I think they landed gently, and at very low speed. Notice how little the soil directly under them was dented?" replied Arcot, walking forward. "They have time control, as I suspected. Ask them. They drifted in gently. Their time rate was speeded up tremendously, so that what was hundreds of miles per hour to us was feet per minute to them. But come on, get the handlers to bring that junk up to the door--they are coming out."  One of the tall, kindly-faced canine people was standing in the doorway now, the white light streaming out around him into the night, casting a grotesque shadow on the landing field, for all the flood lights bathing in it.  Zezdon Afthen came up and spoke quickly to the man evidently in command of the ship. The entire party went into the ship, and the cream of their laboratory instruments was brought in.  For hours Arcot, Morey and Wade worked at the apparatus in the ship, measuring, calculating, following electrical and magnetic and sheer force hook-ups of staggering complexity. They were not trying to find the exact method of construction, only the principles involved, so that they could perform calculations of their own, and duplicate the results of the enemy. Thus they would be far more thoroughly familiar with the machinery when done.  Little attention was paid to the actual driving plant, for it was a molecular drive with the same type of lead-fuel burner they used in their own ship. The tubes of the power bank were, however, a puzzle to them. They were made of relux, so that it was impossible to see the interior of the tube. To open one was to destroy it, but calculations made from readings of their instruments showed that they were more efficient, and could readily carry nearly half again the load that the best terrestrian tubes could sustain. This meant the enemy could send heavier rays and heavier ray screens.  But finally they returned to the _Ancient Mariner_, and as the Ortolian ship whined its way out to space, the _Ancient Mariner_ started, rising faster and faster through the atmosphere till it was in the night of space. Then the molecular power was shut off. The ship suddenly seemed to writhe, space was black and starless about them, then sparkling weirdly distorted stars, all before them. They were moving already. Almost before the Ortolians fully realized what was happening, a dozen stars had swung past the ship, driving on now at better than five light years in every second. At this speed, approximately fourteen hours would be needed to reach Ortol.  "Now, Arcot, perhaps you will explain to me the secret of this ship," said Zezdon Afthen at last, turning from the great lux pilot's window, to Arcot seated in the pilot's chair. "I know that only the broadest principles will be intelligible to me, for I could not understand that ship we captured, after almost four months of study. Yet it crept through space compared with this ship. Certainly no ship could outdistance this in a race!"  "As a matter of fact--watch!" Arcot pushed a little metal button along a slide to the extreme end. Again the ship seemed to writhe. Space was no longer black, but faintly gray, and beside them, on either side, floated two exact replicas of their ship! Zezdon Afthen stared. But in another moment, both were gone, and space was black, yet in but a few moments a grayness was showing, and light was appearing from all about, growing gradually in intensity. For three seconds Arcot continued thus, then he pulled the metal button down the slide, and flicked over another that he had pulled to cause the second change. The stars were again before them, their colors changed beyond all recognition at that speed. But the orientation of the stars behind them had been familiar. Now an entirely different set of constellation showed.  "I merely opened the ship out to her maximum speed for a moment. I was able to see any large star 2000 light years in our path, and there were none. Small stars do not bother us as I will explain. When I put on full power of the main power coils, I drove the ship up to a speed of 30 light years a second. When I turned in the full power of the auxiliary coils as well I doubled the power, and the speed was multiplied by eight. The result was that in the four seconds of racing, we made approximately 1000 light years!"  Zezdon Afthen gasped. "Two hundred and forty light years _per second_"! He paused in bewilderment. "Suppose we had struck a small sun, a dark star, even a meteor at that speed? What would have been the result?"  Arcot smiled. "The chances are excellent that we plowed through more than one meteor, more than one dark star, and more than one small sun.  "But this is the secret: the ship attains the speed only by going out of space. _Nothing in space can attain the speed of light, save radiation._ Nothing in normal space. But, we alter space, make space along patterns we choose, and so distort it that the natural speed of radiation is enormously greater. In fact, we so change space that nothing can go _slower_ than a speed we fix.  "Morey--show Afthen the coils, and explain it all to him. I've got to stay here."  Morey rose, and diving through the weightless ship, went down to the power room, Zezdon Afthen following. Here, giant pots five feet high were in close packed rows. The "pots" contained specially designed coils storing tremendous energy, the energy of four tons of disintegrated lead, in the only form that energy may be stored, as a strain, or distortion in space. These charged coils distorted only the space within themselves, making a closed field entirely within themselves. But in the exact gravitational center of the quarter of a million ton ship was a single high coil of different design that distorted space around it as well as the space within it. This, as Morey explained, was the control that altered the constants of space to suit. The coils were charged, and the energy stored. Their energy could be pumped into the big coil, and then, when the ship slowed to normal space, could be pumped back to them. The pumping energy, as well as any further energy needed for recharging the coils could be supplied by three huge power generators.  "These energy-producers," Morey explained, "work on a principle known for hundreds of years on Earth. Lead, when reduced to a temperature approaching absolute zero as closely as, for instance, liquid helium, has _no_ electrical resistance. In other words, no matter how great a current is sent through it, there is no resistance, and no heat is produced to raise the temperature. What we do is to send a powerful current through a lead wire. The wire has a current density so huge that the atoms are destroyed, and the protons and electrons coalesce into pure radiant energy. Relux, under the influence of a magnetic field, converts this directly into electrical potential. Electricity we can convert to the spatial strain in the power coils, and thus the ship is driven." Morey pointed out the huge molecular power cylinder overhead, where the main power drive was located in the inertial center of the ship, or as near as the great space coil would permit.  The smaller power units for vertical lift, and for steering, were in the side walls, hidden under heavy walls of relux.  "The projectors for throwing molecular and heat rays are on the outside of course. Both of these projectors are protected. The walls of the ship are made of an outer wall of heavy lux metal, a vacuum between, and an inner wall of heavy relux. The lux is stronger than relux, and is therefore used for an outer shell. The inner shell of relux will reflect any dangerous rays and serve to hold the heat in the ship, since a perfect reflector is a perfect non-radiator. The vacuum wall is to protect the occupants of the ship against any undue heat. If we should get within the atmosphere of a sun, it would be disastrous if the physical conduction of heat were permitted, for though the relux will turn out any radiated heat, it is a conductor of heat, and we would roast almost instantly. These artificial metals are both absolutely infusible and non-volatile. The ship has actually been in the limb of a star tremendously hotter than your sun or mine.  "Now you see why it is we need not fear a collision with a small sun, meteor or such like. Since we are in our own, artificial space, we are alone, and there is nothing in space to run into. But, if we enter a huge sun, the terrific gravitational field of the mass of matter would be enough to pull the energy of our coil away from us. That actually happened the time we made our first intergalactic exploration. But it is almost impossible to fall into a large star--they are too brilliant. We won't be worrying about it," grinned Morey.  "But how did the ship we captured operate?" asked Zezdon Afthen.  "It was a very ingenious system, very closely related to ours, really.  "We distort space and change the velocity characteristics; in other words, we distort the rate of motion through distance characteristics of normal space. The Thessian ships work on the principle of distorting the rate of progress through time instead of through space.  "_Velocity_ is really 'units of travel through space per unit of travel through time.' Now if we make the time unit twice as great, and the units traveled through space are not changed, the _velocity_ is twice as great. That is, if we are moving five light years per second, make the second twice as long and we are moving ten light years per double-second. Make it ten thousand times as long, and we are traveling fifty thousand light years per ten-thousand-seconds. This is the principle--but there is a drawback. We might increase the velocity by slowing time passage, that is, if it takes me a year for one heartbeat, two years to raise my arm thus, and six months to turn, my head, if all my body processes are slowed down in this way, I will be able to live a tremendous length of time, and though it takes me two hundred years to go from one star to another, so low is my time rate that the two hundred years will seem but a few minutes. I can then make a trip to a distant star--one five light years distant, let us say, in three minutes to me. I then will say, looking at my chronometer (which has been similarly slowed) 'I have gone five light years in three minutes, or five thirds light years per minute. I have exceeded the speed of light.'  "But people back on Earth would say, he has taken two hundred years to go five light years, therefore he has gone at a speed one fortieth of that of light, which would be true--for their time rate.  "But suppose I can also speed up time. That is, I can live a year in a minute or two. Then everyone else will be exceedingly slow. The ideal thing would be to combine these two effects, arranging that space about your ship will have a very rapid time rate, ten thousand times that of normal space. Then the speed of radiation through that space will be 1,860,000,000 miles per second, and a speed of 1,000,000,000 miles per second would be possible, but still you, too, will be affected, so that though the people back home will say you are going far faster than light, you will say 'No, I am going only 100,000 miles per second.'  "But now imagine that your ship and surrounding space for one mile is at a time rate 10,000 times normal, and you, in a space of one hundred feet within your ship, are affected by a time rate 1/10,000 that, or normal, due to a second, reversing field. The two fields will not fight, or be mutually antagonistic; they will merely compound their effects. Result: you will agree that you are exceeding the speed of light!  "Do you understand? That is the principle on which your ship operated. There were two time-fields, overlapping time-fields. Remember the terrible speed with which your ship landed, and yet there was no appreciable jar according to the men? The answer of course was, that their time rate had been speeded enough, due to the fact that one field had been completely shut off, the other had not.  "That is the principle. The system is so complex, naturally, that we have not yet learned the actual method of working the process. We must do a great deal of mathematical and physical research.  "Wish we had it done--we could use it now," mused the terrestrian.  "We have some other weapons, none as important, of course, as the molecular ray and the heat ray. Or none that have been. But, if the enemy have ray shields, then perhaps these others also will be important. There are molecular motion guns, metal tubes, with molecular director apparatus at one end. A metal shell is pulling the power turned on, and the shell leaps out at a speed of about ten miles per second--since it has been super-heated--and is very accurately aimed, as there is no terrific shock of recoil to be taken up by the gun.  "But a more effective weapon, if these men are as I expect them to be, will be a peculiarly effective magnetic field concentrator device, which will project a magnetic field as a beam for a mile or more. How useful it will be--I don't know. We don't know what the enemy will turn against _us_!"     Chapter V  ORTOL   After Morey's explanation of the ship was completed, Wade took Arcot's place at the controls, while Morey and Arcot retired to the calculating room to do some of the needed mathematics on the time-field investigation.  Their work continued here, while the Ortolians prepared a meal and brought it to them, and to Wade. When at last the sun of Ortol was growing before them, Arcot took over controls from Wade once more. Slowing their speed to less than fifty times that of light, they drove on. The attraction of the giant sun was draining the energy from the coils so rapidly now, that at last Arcot was forced to get into normal space, while the planet was still close to a million miles from them. Morey was showing the Ortolians the operation of the telectroscope and had it trained now on the rapidly approaching planet. The planet was easily enlarged to a point where the features of continents were visible. The magnification was increased till cities were no longer blurs, but truly cities.  Suddenly, as city after city was brought under the action of the machine, the Ortolians recognizing them with glad exclamations, one swept into view--and as they watched, it leapt into the air, a vast column of dust, then twisting, whirling, it fell back in utter, chaotic ruin.  Zezdon Fentes staggered back from the screen in horror.  "Arcot--drive down--increase your speed--the Thessians are there already and have destroyed one city," called Morey sharply. The men secured themselves with heavy belts, as the deep toned hum of the warning echoed through the ship. A moment later they staggered under an acceleration of four gravities. Space was dark for the barest instant of time, and then there was the scream of atmosphere as the ship rocketed through the air of the planet at nearly fifteen hundred miles per second. The outer wall was blazing in incandescence in a moment, and the heavy relux screens seemed to leap into place over the windows as the blasting heat, radiated from the incandescent walls flooded in. The millions of tons pressure of the air on the nose of the ship would have brought it to a stop in an instant, and had it not been that the molecular drive was on at full power, driving the ship against the air resistance, and still losing. The ship slowed swiftly, but was shrieking toward the destroyed city at terrific speed.  "Hesthis--to the--right and ahead. That would be their next attack," said the Ortolian. Arcot altered the ship's course, and they shot toward the distance city of Hesthis. They were slowing perceptibly, and yet, though the city was half around the world, they reached it in half a minute. Now Arcot's wizardry at the controls came into play, for by altering his space field constants, he succeeded in reaching a condition that slowed the ship almost instantly to a speed of but a mile a second, yet without apparent deceleration.  High in the white Ortolian sky was a shining point bearing down on the now-visible city. Arcot slanted toward it, and the approaching ship grew like an expanding rubber balloon.  A ray of intense, blindingly brilliant light flashed out, and a gout of light appeared in the center of the city. A huge flame, bright blue, shot heavenward in roaring heat.  Seeing that a strange ship had arrived was enough for the Thessians, and they turned, and drove at Arcot instantly. The Thessian ship was built for a heavy world, and for heavy acceleration in consequence, and, as they had found from the captured ship, it was stronger than the _Ancient Mariner_. Now the Thessians were driving at Arcot with an acceleration and speed that convinced him dodging was useless. Suddenly space was black around them, the sunlit world was gone.  "Wonder what they thought of _that_!" grinned Arcot. Wade smiled grimly.  "It's not what they thought, but what they'll do, that counts."  Arcot came back to normal space, just in time to see the Thessian ship spin in a quick turn, under an acceleration that would have crushed a human to a pulp. Again the pilot dived at the terrestrian ship. Again it vanished. Twice more he tried these fruitless tactics, seeing the ship loom before him--bracing for the crash--then it was gone instantaneously, and though he sailed through the spot he knew it to have occupied, it was not there. Yet an instant later, as he turned, it was floating, unharmed, exactly where his ship had passed!  Rushing was useless. He stood, and prepared to give battle. A molecular ray reached out--and disappeared in flaring ions on a shield utterly impenetrable in the ionizing atmosphere.  Arcot meanwhile watched the instrument of his shield. The Thessian shield would have been impenetrable, but his shield, fed by less efficient tubes, was not, and he knew it. Already the terrific energy of the Thessian ray was noticeably heating the copper plates of the tube. The seal would break soon.  Another ray reached out, a ray of flaring light. Arcot, watching through the "eyes" of his telectroscope viewplates, saw it for but an instant, then the "eyes" were blasted, and the screen went blank.  "He won't do anything with that but burn out eyes," muttered the terrestrian. He pushed a small button when his instruments told him the rays were off. Another scanner came into action, and the viewplate was alive again.  Arcot shot out a cosmic ray himself, and swept the Thessian with it thoroughly. For the instant he needed the enemy ship was blinded. Immediately the _Ancient Mariner_ dove, and the automatic ray-finders could no longer hold the rays on his ship. As soon as he was out of the deadly molecular ray he shut off his screen, and turned on all his molecular rays. The Thessian ship, their own ray on, had been unable to put up their screen, as Arcot was unable to use his ray with the enemy's ray forcing him to cover with a shield.  Almost at once the relux covering of the Thessian ship shone with characteristic iridescence as it changed swiftly to lux metal. The molecular ray blinked out, and a ray screen flashed out instead. The Thessians were covering up. Their own rays were useless now. Though Arcot could not hope to destroy their ray shield, they could no longer attack his, for their rays were useless, and already they had lost so much of the protective relux, that they would not be so foolhardy as to risk a second attack of the ray.  Arcot continued to bathe the ship in energy, keeping their "eyes" closed. As long as he could hold his barrage on them, they would not damage him.  "Morey--get into the power room, strap onto the board. Throw all the power-coil banks into the magnets. I may burn them out, but I have hopes--" Arcot already had the generators going full power, charging the power coils.  Morey dived. Almost simultaneously the Thessians succeeded in the maneuver they had been attempting for some time. There were a dozen rays flaring wildly from the ship, searching blindly over the sky and ground, hoping to stumble on the enemy ship, while their own ship dived and twisted. Arcot was busily dodging the sweeping rays, but finally one hit his viewplates, and his own ship was blind. Instantly he threw the ray screen out, cutting off his own molecular ray. His own cosmics he set rotating in cones that covered the three dimensions--save below, where the city lay. Immediately the Thessian had retreated to this one segment where Arcot did not dare throw his own rays. The Thessian cosmics continued to make his relux screens necessary, and his ship remained blind.  His ray screen was showing signs of weakening. The Thessians got a third ray into position for operation, and opened up. Almost at once the tubes heated terrifically. In an instant they would give way. Arcot threw his ship into space, and let the tubes cool under the water jacket. Morey reported the coils ready as soon as he came out of space.  Arcot cut in the new set of eyes, and put up his molecular ray screen again. Then he cut the energy back to the coils.  Half a mile below the enemy ship was vainly scurrying around an empty sky. Wade laughed at the strange resemblance to a puppy chasing its tail. The _Ancient Mariner_ was utterly lost to them.  "Well, here goes the last trick," said Arcot grimly. "If this doesn't work, they'll probably win, for their tubes are better than ours, and they can maneuver faster. By win I mean force us to let them attack Ortol. They can't really attack us; artificial space is a perfect defense."  Arcot's molecular ray apprized the Thessians of his presence. Their screen flared up once more. Arcot was driving straight toward their ship as they turned. He snapped the relux screens in front of his eyes an instant before the enemy cosmics reached his ship. Immediately the thud of four heavy relays rang through the ship. The quarter of a million ton ship leaped forward under a terrific acceleration, and then, as the four relays cut out again, the acceleration was gone. The screen regained life as Arcot opened the shutters. Before them, still directly in their path, was the huge Thessian ship. But now its screen was down, the relux iridescent in decomposition. It was falling, helplessly falling to the rocky plateau seven miles below. Its rays reached out even yet--and again the _Ancient Mariner_ staggered under the terrific pull of some acceleration. The Thessian ship lurched upward, and a terrific concussion came, and the entire neighborhood of that projector disappeared in a flash of radiation.  Arcot drove the _Ancient Mariner_ down beneath the Thessian ship in its long fall, and with a powerful molecular beam ripped a mighty chasm in the deserted plateau. The Thessian ship fell into a quarter mile rift in the solid rock, smashing its way through falling debris. A moment later it was buried beneath a quarter mile of broken rock as Arcot swept a molecular beam about with the grace of a mine foreman filling breaks.  An instant later, a heat ray followed the molecular in dazzling brilliance. A terrific gout of light appeared in the barren rocks. In ten minutes the plateau was a white hot cauldron of molten rocks, glowing now against a darkening sky. Night was falling.  "That ship," said Arcot with an air of finality, "will never rise again."     Chapter VI  THE SECOND MOVE   "What happened to him, though?" asked Wade, bewildered. "I haven't yet figured it out. He went down in a heap, and he didn't have any power. Of course, if he had his power he could have pulled out again. He could just melt and burn all the excess rock off, and he would be all set. But his rays all went dead. And why the explosion?"  "The magnetic beam is the answer. In our boat we have everything magnetically shielded, because of the enormous magnetic flux set up by the current flowing from the storage coils to the main coil. But--with so many wires heavily charged with current, what would have happened if they had not been shielded?  "If a current cuts across a magnetic field, a side thrust is developed. What do you suppose happened when the terrific magnetic field of the beam and the currents in the wires of their power-board were mutually opposed?"  "Lord, it must have ripped away everything in the ship. It'd tear loose even the lighting wires!" gasped Wade in amazement.  "But if all the power of the ship was destroyed in this way, how was it that one of their rays was operating as they fell?" asked Zezdon Afthen.  "Each ray is a power plant in itself," explained Arcot, "and so it was able to function. I do not know the cause of the explosion, though it might well have been that they had light-bombs such as the Kaxorians of Venus have," he added, thoughtfully.  They landed, at Zezdon's advice, in the city that their arrival had been able to save. This was Ortol's largest city, and their industrial capital. Here, too, was the University at which Afthen taught.  They landed, and Arcot, Morey and Wade, with the aid of Zezdon Afthen and Zezdon Fentes worked steadily for two of their days of fifty hours each, teaching men how to make and use the molecular ships, and the rays and screens, heat beams, and relux. But Arcot promised that when he returned he would have some weapon that would bring them certain and easy salvation. In the meantime other terrestrians would follow him.  They left the morning of their third day on the planet. A huge crowd had come to cheer them on their way as they left, but it was the "silent cheer" of Ortol, a telepathic well-wishing.  "Now," said Arcot as their ship left the planet behind, "we will have to make the next move. It certainly looks as though that next move would be to the still-unknown race that lives on world 3769-37, 478, 326, 894-6. Evidently we will have to have some weapon they haven't, and I think that I know what it will be. Thanks to our trip out to the Islands of Space."  "Shall we go?"  "I think it would be wise," agreed Morey.  "And I," said Wade. The Ortolians agreed, and so, with the aid of the photographic copies of the Thessian charts that Arcot had made, they started for world 3769-37, 478, 326, 894-6.  "It will take approximately twenty-two hours, and as we have been putting off our sleep with drugs, I think that we had better catch up. Wade, I wish you'd take the ship again, while Morey and I do a little concentrated sleeping. We have by no means finished that calculation, and I'd very much like to. We'll relieve you in five hours."  Wade took the ship, and following the course Arcot laid out, they sped through the void at the greatest safe speed. Wade had only to watch the view-screen carefully, and if a star showed as growing rapidly, it was proof that they were near, and nearing rapidly. If large, a touch of a switch, and they dodged to one side, if small, they were suddenly plunged into an instant of unbelievable radiation as they swept through it, in a different space, yet linked to it by radiation, not light, that were permitted in.  Zezdon Afthen had elected to stay with him, which gave him an opportunity he had been waiting for. "If it's none of my business, just say so," he began. "But that first city we saw the Thessians destroy--it was Zezdon Fentes' home, wasn't it? Did he have a family?"  The words seemed blunt as he said them, but there was no way out, once he had started. And Zezdon Afthen took the question with complete calm.  "Fentes had both wives and children," he said quietly. "His loss was great."  Wade concentrated on the screen for a moment, trying to absorb the shock. Then, fearing Zezdon Afthen might misinterpret his silence, he plunged on. "I'm sorry," he said. "I didn't realize you were polygamous--most people on Earth aren't, but some groups are. It's probably a good way to improve the race. But ... Blast it, what bothers me is that Zezdon Fentes seemed to recover from the blow so quickly! From a canine race, I'd expect more affection, more loyalty, more...."  He stopped in dismay. But Zezdon Afthen remained unperturbed. "More unconcealed emotion?" he asked. "No. Affection and loyalty we have--they _are_ characteristic of our race. But affection and loyalty should not be uselessly applied. To _forget_ dead wives and children--that would be insulting to their memory. But to mourn them with senseless loss of health and balance would also be insulting--not only to their memory, but to the entire race.  "No, we have a better way. Fentes, my very good friend, has not forgotten, no more than you have forgotten the death of your mother, whom you loved. But you no longer mourn her death with a fear and horror of that natural thing, the Eternal Sleep. Time has softened the pain.  "If we can do the same in five minutes instead of five years, is it not better? That is why Fentes has _forgotten_".  "Then you have aged his memory of that event?" asked Wade in surprise.  "That is one way of stating it," replied Zezdon Afthen seriously.  Wade was silent for a while, absorbing this. But he could not contain his curiosity completely. _Well, to hell with it_, he decided. _Conventional manners and tact don't have much meaning between two different races_. "Are you--married?" he asked.  "Only three times," Zezdon Afthen told him blandly. "And to forestall your next question--no, our system does not create problems. At least, not those you're thinking of. I know my wives have never had the jealous quarrels I see in your mind pictures."  "It isn't safe thinking things around you," laughed Wade. "Just the same, all of this has made me even more interested in the 'Ancient Masters' you keep mentioning. Who were they?"  "The Ancient Ones," began Zezdon Afthen slowly, "were men such as you are. They descended from a primeval omnivorous mammal very closely related to your race. Evidently the tendency of evolution on any planet is approximately the same with given conditions.  "The race existed as a distinct branch for approximately 1,500,000 of your years before any noticeable culture was developed. Then it existed for a total of 1,525,000 years before extinction. With culture and learning they developed such marvelous means of killing themselves that in twenty-five thousand years they succeeded perfectly. Ten thousand years of barbaric culture--I need not relate it to you, five thousand years of the medieval culture, then five thousand years of developed science culture.  "They learned to fly through space and nearly populated three worlds; two were fully populated, one was still under colonization when the great war broke out. An interplanetary war is not a long drawn out struggle. The science of any people so far advanced as to have interplanetary lines is too far developed to permit any long duration of war. Selto declared war, and made the first move. They attacked and destroyed the largest city of Ortol of that time. Ortolian ships drove them off, and in turn attacked Selto's largest city. Twenty million intelligences, twenty million lives, each with its aims, its hopes, its loves and its strivings--gone in four days.  "The war continued to get more and more hateful, till it became evident that neither side would be pacified till the other was totally subjugated. So each laid his plans, and laid them to wipe out the entire world of the other.  "Ortol developed a ray of light that made things not happen," explained Zezdon Afthen, his confused thoughts clearly indicating his own uncertainty.  "'A ray of light that made things not happen,'" repeated Wade curiously. "A ray, which prevented things, which caused processes to stop--_The Negrian Death Ray_!" he exclaimed as he suddenly recognized, in this crude and garbled description of its powers, the Negrian ray of anti-catalysis, a ray which tended to stop the processes of life's chemistry and bring instant, painless death.  "Ah, you know it, too?" asked the Ortolian eagerly. "Then you will understand what happened. The ray was turned first on Selto, and as the whirling planet spun under it, every square foot of it was wiped clean of every living thing, from gigantic Welsthan to microscopic Ascoptel, and every man, woman and child was killed, painlessly, but instantly.  "Then Thenten spun under it, and all were killed, but many who had fled the planets were still safe--many?--a few thousand.  "The day that Thenten spun under that ray, men of Ortol began to complain of disease--men by the thousands, hundreds of thousands. Every man, every woman, every child was afflicted in some way. The diseases did not seem all the same. Some seemingly died of a disease of the lungs, some went insane, some were paralyzed, and lay helplessly inactive. But most of them were afflicted, for it was exceedingly virulent, and the normal serums were helpless. Before any quantity of new serum was made, all but a slender remnant had died, either of starvation through paralysis, none being left to care for them, or from the disease itself, while thousands who had gone mad were painlessly killed.  "The Seltonians came to Ortol, and the remaining Ortolians, with their aid, tried to rebuild the civilization. But what a sorry thing! The cities were gigantic, stinking, plague-ridden morgues. And the plague broke among those few remaining people. The Ortolians had done everything in their power with the serums--but too late. The Seltonians had been protected with it on landing--but even that was not enough. Again the wild fires of that loathsome disease broke out.  "Since first those men had developed from their hairy forebears, they had found their eternal friends were the dogs, and to them they turned in their last extremity, breeding them for intelligence, hairlessness, and resemblance to themselves. The Deathless ones alone remained after three generations of my people, but with the aid of certain rays, the rays capable of penetrating lead for a short distance, and most other substances for considerable distances." X-rays, thought Wade. "Great changes had been wrought. Already they had developed startling intelligence, and were able to understand the scheme of their Masters. Their feet and hands were being modified rapidly, and their vocal apparatus was changing. Their jaws shortened, their chins developed, the nose retreated.  "Generation after generation the process went on, while the Deathless Ancient Ones worked with their helpers, for soon my race was a real helping organization.  "But it was done. The successful arousing of true love-emotion followed, and the unhappy days were gone. Quickly development followed. In five thousand years the new race had outstripped the Ancient Masters, and they passed, voluntarily, willingly joining in oblivion the millions who had died before.  "Since then our own race has risen, it has been but a short thousand years, a thousand years of work, and hope, and continuous improvement for us, continual accomplishment on which we can look, and a living hope to which we could look with raised heads, and smiling faces.  "Then our hope died, as this menace came. Do you see what you and your world was meant to us, Man of Earth?" Zezdon Afthen raised his dark eyes to the terrestrian with a look in their depths that made Wade involuntarily resolve that Thet and all Thessians should be promptly consigned to that limbo of forgotten things where they belonged.     Chapter VII  WORLD 3769-37,478,326,894,6, TALSO   Wade sat staring moodily at the screen for some time, while Zezdon Afthen, sunk in his own reveries, continued.  "Our race was too highly psychic, and too little mechanically curious. We learned too little of the world about, and too much of our own processes. We are a peaceful race, for, while you and the Ancient Masters learned the rule of existence in a world of strife, where only the fittest, the best fighters survived, we learned life in a carefully tended world, where the Ancient Masters taught us to live, where the one whose social instincts were best developed, where he who would most help the others, and the race, was permitted to live. Is it not natural that our race will not fight among themselves? We are careful to suppress tendencies toward criminality and struggle. The criminal and the maniac, or those who are permanently incurable as determined by careful examination, are 'removed' as the Leaders put it. Lethal gas.  "At any rate, we know so pitiably little of natural science. We were hopelessly helpless against an attacking science."  "I promise you, Afthen, that if Earth survives, Ortol shall survive, for we have given you all the weapons we know of and we will give your people all the weapons we shall learn of." Morey spoke from the doorway. Arcot was directly behind him.  They talked for a short while, then Wade retired for some needed sleep, while Morey and Arcot started further work on the time fields.  Hour after hour the ship sped on through the dark of space, weirdly distorted, glowing spots of light before them, wheeling suns that moved and flashed as their awesome speed whirled them on.  They had to move slower soon, as the changing stars showed them near the space-marks of certain locating suns. Finally, still moving close to fifteen thousand miles per second, they saw the sun they knew was sun 3769-37,478,-326,894, twice as large as Sol, two and a half times as massive and twenty-six times as brilliant.  Thirteen major planets they counted as they searched the system with their powerful telectroscope, the outermost more than ten billion miles from the parent sun, while planet six, the one indicated by the world number, was at a distance of five hundred million miles, nearly as far from the sun as Jupiter is from ours, yet the giant sun, giving more than twenty-five times as much heat and light in the blue-white range, heated the planet to approximately the same temperature Earth enjoys. Spectroscopy showed that the atmosphere was well supplied with oxygen, and so the inhabitants were evidently oxygen-breathing men, unlike those of the Negrian people who live in an atmosphere of hydrogen.  Arcot threw the ship toward the planet, and as it loomed swiftly larger, he shut off the space-control, and set the coils for full charge, while the ship entered the planet's atmosphere in a screaming dive, still at a speed of better than a hundred miles a second. But this speed was quickly damped as the ship shot high over broad oceans to the dull green of land ahead in the daylit zone. Observations made from various distances by means of the space-control, thus going back in time, show that the planet had a day of approximately forty hours, the diameter was nearly nine thousand miles, which would probably mean an inconveniently high gravity for the terrestrians and a distressingly high gravity for the Ortolians, used to their world even smaller than Earth, with scarcely 80 percent of Earth's gravity.  Wade made some volumetric analysis of the atmosphere, and with the aid of a mouse, pronounced it "Q.A.R." (quite all right) for human beings. It had not killed the mouse, so probably humans would find it quite all right.  "We'll land at the first city that comes into view," suggested Arcot. "Afthen, you be the spokesman; you have a very considerable ability with the mental communication, and have a better understanding of the physics we need to explain than has Zezdon Fentes."  They were over land, a rocky coast that shot behind them as great jagged mountains, tipped with snow, rose beneath. Suddenly, a shining apparition appeared from behind one of the neighboring hills, and drove down at them with an unearthly acceleration. Arcot moved just enough to dodge the blow, and turned to meet the ship. Instantly, now that he had a good view of it he was certain it was a Thessian ship. Waiting no longer to determine that it was not a ship of this world, he shot a molecular beam at it. The beam exploded into a coruscating panoply of pyrotechnics on the Thessian shield. The Thessian replied with all beams he had available, including an induction-beam, an intensely brilliant light-beam, and several molecular cannons with shells loaded with an explosive that was very evidently condensed light. This was no exploration ship, but a full-fledged battleship.  The _Ancient Mariner_ was blinded instantly. None of the occupants were hurt, but the combined pressure of the various beams hurled the ship to one side. The induction beam alone was dangerous. It passed through the outer lux-metal wall unhindered, and the perfectly conducting relux wall absorbed it, and turned it into power. At once, all the metal objects in the ship began to heat up with terrific rapidity. Since there were no metallic conductors on the ship, no damage was done.  Arcot immediately hid behind his perfect shield--the space-distortion.  "That's no mild dose," he said in a tense voice, working rapidly. "He's a real-for-sure battleship. Better get down in the power room, Morey."  In a few moments the ship was ready again. Opening the shield somewhat, Arcot was able to determine that no rays were being played on it, for no energy fields disclosed as distorting the opened field, other than the field of the sun and planet.  Arcot opened it. The battleship was searching vainly about the mountains, and was now some miles distant. His last view of Arcot's ship had been a suddenly contracting ship, one that vanished in infinite distance, the infinite distance of another space, though he did not know it.  Arcot turned three powerful heat beams on the Thessian ship, and drove down toward it, accompanying them with molecular rays. The Thessian shield stopped the moleculars, but the heat had already destroyed the eyes of the ship. By some system of magnetic or electrostatic locating devices, the enemy guns and rays replied, and so successfully that Arcot was again blinded.  He had again been driving in a line straight toward the enemy, and now he threw in the entire power of his huge magnetic field-rays. The induction ray disappeared, and the heat, light and cannons stopped.  "Worked again," grinned Arcot. A new set of eyes was inserted automatically, and the screen again lighted. The Thessian ship was spinning end over end toward the ground. It landed with a tremendous crash. Simultaneously from the rear of the _Ancient Mariner_ came a terrific crash, an explosion that drove the terrestrian ship forward, as though a giant hand had pushed it from behind.  The _Ancient Mariner_ spun like a top, facing the direction of the explosion, though still traveling in the direction it had been pursuing, but backward now. Behind them the air was a gigantic pool of ionization. Tremendous fragments of what obviously had been a ship were drifting down, turning end over end. And those fragments of the wall showed them to be fully four feet of solid relux.  "Enemy got up behind somehow while the eyes were out, and was ready to raise merry hell. Somebody blew them up beautifully. Look at the ground down there--it's red hot. That's from the radiated heat of our recent encounter. Heat rays reflected, light bombs turned off, heat escaping from ions--nice little workout--and it didn't seriously bother our defenses of two-inch relux. Now tell me: what will blow up four-foot relux?" asked Arcot, looking at the fragments. "It seems to me those fellows don't need any help from us; they may decline it with thanks."  "But they may be willing to help us," replied Afthen, "and we certainly need such help."  "I didn't expect to come out alive from that battleship there. It was luck. If they knew what we had, they could insulate against it in an hour," added Arcot.  "Let's finish those fellows over there--look!" From the wreck of the ship they had downed, a stream of men in glistening relux suits were filing. Any men comparable to humans would have been killed by the fall, but not Thessians. They carried peculiar machines, and as they drove out of the ship in dive that looked as though they had been shot from a cannon, they turned and landed on the ground and proceeded to jump back, leaping at a speed that was bewildering, seemingly impossible in any living creature.  They busied themselves quickly. It took less than thirty seconds, and they had a large relux disc laid under the entire group and machines. Arcot turned a molecular ray down. The rock and soil shot up all about them, even the ship shot up, to fall back into the great pit its ray had formed. But the ionization told of the ray shield over the little group of men. A heat ray reached down, while the men still frantically worked at their stubby projectors. The relux disc now showed its purpose. In an instant the soil about them was white hot, bubbling lava. It was liquid, boiling furiously. But the deep relux disc simply floated on it. The enemy ship began sinking, and in a moment had fallen almost completely beneath the white hot rock.  A fountain of the melted lava sprung up, and under Arcot's skillful direction, fell in a cloud of molten rock on the men working. The suits protected, and the white hot stuff simply rolled off. But it was sinking their boat. Arcot continued hopefully.  Meanwhile a signaling machine was frantically calling for help and sending out information of their plight and position.  Then all was instantly wiped out in a single terrific jolt of the magnetic beam. The machines jumped a little, despite their weight, and the ray shield apparatus slumped suddenly in blazing white heat, the interior mechanism fused. But the men were still active, and rapidly spreading from the spot, each protected by a ray shield pack.  A brilliant stab of molecular ray shot at each from either of two of the _Ancient Mariner'_s projectors as Morey aided Arcot. Their little packs flared brilliantly for an instant under the thousands of horsepower of energy lashing at the screen, then flashed away, and the opalescent relux yielded a moment later, and the figure went twisting, hurtling away. Meanwhile Wade was busy with the magnetic apparatus, destroying shield after shield, which either Arcot or Morey picked off. The fall from even so much as half a mile seemed not sufficient to seriously bother these supermen, for an instant later they would be up tearing away in great leaps on their own power as their molecular suits, blown out by the magnetic field, failed them.  It was but a matter of minutes before the last had been chased down either by the rays or the ship. Then, circling back, Arcot slowly settled beside the enemy ship.  "Wait," called Arcot sharply as Morey started for the door.  "Don't go out yet. The friends who wrecked that little sweetheart who crept up behind will probably show up. Wait and see what happens." Hardly had he spoken, when a strange apparition rose from behind a rock scarcely a quarter of a mile away. Immediately Arcot intensified the vision screen covering him. He seemed to leap near. There was one man, and he held what was obviously a sword by the blade, above his head, waving it from side to side.  "There they are--whatever they are. Intelligent all right--what more universally obvious peace sign than a primitive weapon such as a knife held in reverse position? You go with Zezdon Afthen. Try holding a carving knife by the blade."  Morey grinned as he got into his power suit, on Wade's O.K. of the atmosphere. "They may mistake me for the cook out looking for dinner, and I wouldn't risk my dignity that way. I'll take the baseball bat and hold it wrong way instead."  Nevertheless, as he stepped from the ship, with Afthen close behind, he held the long knife by the blade, and Afthen, very awkwardly operating his still rather unfamiliar power suit, followed.  Into the intensely blue sunlight the men stepped. Their skin and clothing took on a peculiar tint under the strange sunlight.  The single stranger was joined by a second, also holding a reversed weapon, and together they threw them down. Morey and Zezdon Afthen followed suit. The two parties advanced toward each other.  The strangers advanced with a swift, light step, jumping from rock to rock, while Morey and Afthen flew part way toward them. The men of this world were totally unlike any intelligent race Morey had conceived of. Their head and brain case was so small as to be almost animalish. The nose was small and well formed, the ears more or less cup-shaped with a remarkable power of motion. Their eyes were seemingly huge, probably no larger than a terrestrian's, though in the tiny head they were necessarily closely placed, protected by heavy bony ridges that actually projected from the skull to enclose them. Tiny, childlike chins completed the head, running down to a scrawny neck.  They were short, scarcely five feet, yet evidently of tremendous strength for their short, heavy arms, the muscle bulging plainly under the tight rubber-like composition garments, and the short legs whose stocky girth proclaimed equal strength were members of a body in keeping with them. The deep, broad chest, wide, square shoulders, heavy broad hips, combined with the tiny head seemed to indicate a perfect incarnation of brainless, brute strength.  "Strangers from another planet, enemies of our enemies. What brings you here at this time of troubles?" The thoughts came clearly from the stocky individual before them.  "We seek to aid, and to find aid. The menace that you face, attacks not alone your world, but all this star cluster," replied Zezdon Afthen steadily.  The stranger shook his head with an evident expression of hopelessness. "The menace is even greater than we feared. It was just fortune that permitted us to have our weapon in workable condition at the time your ship was attacked. It will be a day before the machine will again be capable of successful operation. When in condition for use, it is invincible, but--one blow in thirty hours--you can see we are not of great aid." He shrugged.  An enemy with evident resources of tremendous power, deadly, unknown rays that wiped out entire cities with a single brief sweep--and no defense save this single weapon, good but once a day! Morey could read the utter despair of the man.  "What is the difficulty?" asked Morey eagerly.  "Power, lack of power. Our cities are going without power, while every electric generator on the planet is pouring its output into the accumulators that work these damnable, hopeless things. Invincible with power--helpless without."  "Ah!" Morey's face shone with delight--invincible weapon--with power. And the _Ancient Mariner_ could generate unthinkable power.  "What power source do you use--how do you generate your power?"  "Combining oxidizing agent with reducing agents releases heat. Heat used to boil liquid and the vapor runs turbines."  "We can give you power. What wattage have you available?"  Only Morey's thoughts had to translate "watts" to "How many man-weights can you lift through your height per time interval, equal to this." He gave the man some impression of a second, by counting. The man figured rapidly. His answer indicated that approximately a total of two billion kilowatts were available.  "Then the weapon is invincible hereafter, if what you say is true. Our ship alone can easily generate ten thousand times that power.  "Come, get in the ship, accompany us to your capital."  The men turned, and retreated to their position behind the rocks, while Morey and Zezdon Afthen waited for them. Soon they returned, and entered the ship.  "Our world," explained the leader rapidly, "is a single unified colony. The capital is 'Shesto,' our world we call 'Talso.'" His directions were explicit, and Arcot started for Shesto, on Talso.     Chapter VIII  UNDEFEATABLE OR UNCONTROLLABLE?   Fifteen minutes after they started, they came to Shesto. They were forced to land, and explain, for their relux ship was decidedly not the popular Talsonian idea of a life-saver.  Shesto was defended by two of the machines, and each machine had been equipped with two fully charged accumulators. Their four possible shots were hoped to be sufficient protection, and, so far, had been. The city had been attacked twice, according to Tho Stan Drel, the Talsonian: once by a single ship which had been instantly destroyed, and once by a fleet of six ships. The interval had permitted time to recharge the discharged accumulator, and the fleet had been badly treated. Of the six ships, four had been brought down in rapid succession, and the remaining two ships had fled.  When the first city had been wiped out, with a loss of life well in the hundreds of thousands, the other cities had, to limit of their abilities, set up the protective apparatus. Apparently the Thessians were holding off for the present.  "In a way," said Morey seriously, "it was distinctly fortunate that we were attacked almost at once. Their instantaneous system of destruction would have worked for the one shot needed to send the _Ancient Mariner_ to eternal blazes." He laughed, but it was a slightly nervous laugh.  The terrestrial ship landed in a great grassy court, and out of respect for the parklike smoothness of the turf, Arcot left the ship on its power units, suspended a bit above the surface. Then he, Morey and the Talsonian left the ship. Zezdon Afthen was left with the ship and with Wade in charge, for if some difficulties were encountered, Wade would be able to help them with the ship, and Zezdon Afthen with the tremendous power of his thought locating apparatus, was busy seeking out the Thessian stronghold.  A party of men of Talso met the terrestrians outside the ship.  "Welcome, Men of another world, and to you go our thanks for the destruction of one of our enemies." The clear thoughts of the spokesman evinced his ability to concentrate.  "And to your world must go our thanks for saving of our lives, and more important, our ship," replied Arcot. "For the ship represents a thing of enormous value to this entire star-system."  "I see--understand--your--thoughts that you wish to learn more of this weapon we use. You understand that it is a question among us as to whether it is undefeatable, uncontrollable or just un-understandable. We have had fair success with it. It is not a weapon, was not developed as such; it was an experiment in the line of electric-waves. How it works, what it is, what happens--we do not know.  "But men who can create so marvelous a ship as this of yours, capable of destroying a ship of the Thessians with their own weapons must certainly be able to understand any machine we may make--and you have power?" he finished eagerly.  "Practically infinite power. I will throw into any power line you suggest, all the direct current you wish." Arcot's thoughts were pure reflection, but the Talsonian brightened at once.  "I feared it might be alternating--but we can handle direct current. All our transmission is done at high voltage direct current. What potential do you generate? Will we have to install changers?"  "We generate D.C. at any voltage up to fifty million, any power up to that needed to lift ten trillion men through their own height in this time a second." The power represented approximately twenty trillion horsepower.  The Talsonian's face went blank with amazement as he looked at the ship. "In that tiny thing you generate such power?" he asked in amazement.  "In that tiny ship we generate more than one million times that power," Arcot said.  "Our power troubles are over," declared the military man emphatically.  "Our troubles are not over," replied a civilian who had joined the party, with equal emphasis. "As a matter of fact, they are worse than ever. More tantalizing. What he says means that we have a tremendous power source, but it is in one spot. How are you going to transmit the power? We can't possibly move any power anywhere near that amount. We couldn't touch it to our lines without having them all go up in one instantaneous blaze of glory.  "We cannot drain such a lake of power through our tiny power pipes of silver."  "This man is Stel Felso Theu," said Tho Stan Drel. "The greatest of our scientists, the man who has invented this weapon which alone seems to offer us hope. And I am afraid he is right. See, there is the University. For the power requirements of their laboratories, a heavy power line has been installed, and it was hoped that you could carry leads into it." His face showed evident despair greater than ever.  "We can always feed some power into the lines. Let us see just what hope there is. I think that it would be wiser to investigate the power lines at once," suggested Morey.  Ten minutes later, with but a single officer now accompanying them, Tho Stan Drel, the terrestrial scientist, and the Talsonian scientist were inspecting the power installation.  They had entered a large stone building, into which led numerous very heavy silver wires. The insulators were silicate glass. Their height suggested a voltage of well over one hundred thousand, and such heavy cables suggested a very heavy amperage, so that a tremendous load was expected.  Within the building were a series of gigantic glass tubes, their walls fully three inches thick, and even so, braced with heavy platinum rods. Inside the tubes were tremendous elements such as the tiny tubes of their machine carried. Great cables led into them, and now their heating coils were glowing a somberly deep red.  Along the walls were the switchboards, dozens of them, all sizes, all types of instruments, strange to the eyes of the terrestrians, and in practically all the light-beam indicator system was used, no metallic pointers, but tiny mirrors directing a very fine line of brilliant light acted as a needle. The system thus had practically no inertia.  "Are these the changers?" asked Arcot gazing at the gigantic tubes.  "They are; each tube will handle up to a hundred thousand volts," said Stel Felso Theu.  "But I fear, Stel Felso Theu, that these tubes will carry power only one way; that is, it would be impossible for power to be pumped from here into the power house, though the process can be reversed," pointed out Arcot. "Radio tubes work only one way, which is why they can act as rectifiers. The same was true of these tubes. They could carry power one way only."  "True, of tubes in general," replied the Talsonian, "and I see by that that you know the entire theory of our tubes, which is rather abstruse."  "We use them on the ship, in special form," interrupted Arcot.  "Then I will only say that the college here has a very complete electric power plant of its own. On special occasions, the power generated here is needed by the city, and so we arranged the tubes with switches which could reverse the flow. At present they are operating to pour power into the city.  "If your ship can generate such tremendous power, I suspect that it would be wiser to eliminate the tubes from the circuit, for they put certain restrictions on the line. The main power plant in the city has tube banks capable of handling anything the line would. I suggest that your voltage be set at the maximum that the line will carry without breakdown, and the amperage can be made as high as possible without heat loss."  "Good enough. The line to the city power will stand what pressure?"  "It is good for the maximum of these tubes," replied the Talsonian.  "Then get into communication with the city plant and tell them to prepare for every work-unit they can carry. I'll get the generator." Arcot turned, and flew on his power suit to the ship.  In a few moments he was back, a molecular pistol in one hand, and suspended in front of him on nothing but a ray of ionized air, to all appearances, a cylindrical apparatus, with a small cubical base.  The cylinder was about four feet long, and the cubical box about eighteen inches on a side.  "What is that, and what supports it?" asked the Talsonian scientists in surprise.  "The thing is supported by a ray which directs the molecules of a small bar in the top clamp, driving it up," explained Morey, "and that is the generator."  "That! Why it is hardly as big as a man!" exclaimed the Talsonian.  "Nevertheless, it can generate a billion horsepower. But you couldn't get the power away if you did generate it." He turned toward Arcot, and called to him.  "Arcot--set it down and let her rip on about half a million horsepower for a second or so. Air arc. Won't hurt it--she's made of lux and relux."  Arcot grinned, and set it on the ground. "Make an awful hole in the ground."  "Oh--go ahead. It will satisfy this fellow, I think," replied Morey.  Arcot pulled a very thin lux metal cord from his pocket, and attached one end of a long loop to one tiny switch, and the other to a second. Then he adjusted three small dials. The wire in hand, he retreated to a distance of nearly two hundred feet, while Morey warned the Talsonians back. Arcot pulled one end of his cord.  Instantly a terrific roar nearly deafened the men, a solid sheet of blinding flame reached in a flaming cone into the air for nearly fifty feet. The screeching roar continued for a moment, then the heat was so intense that Arcot could stand no more, and pulled the cord. The flame died instantly, though a slight ionization clung briefly. In a moment it had cooled to white, and was cooling slowly through orange--red deep--red--  The grass for thirty feet about was gone, the soil for ten feet about was molten, boiling. The machine itself was in a little crater, half sunk in boiling rock. The Talsonians stared in amazement. Then a sort of sigh escaped them and they started forward. Arcot raised his molecular pistol, a blue green ray reached out, and the rock suddenly was black. It settled swiftly down, and a slight depression was the only evidence of the terrific action.  Arcot walked over the now cool rock, cooled by the action of the molecular ray. In driving the molecules downward, the work was done by the heat of these molecules. The machine was frozen in the solid lava.  "Brilliant idea, Morey," said Arcot disgustedly. "It'll be a nice job breaking it loose."  Morey stuck the lux metal bar in the top clamp, walked off some distance, and snapped on the power. The rock immediately about the machine was molten again. A touch of the molecular pistol to the lux metal bar, and the machine jumped free of the molten rock.  Morey shut off the power. The machine was perfectly clean, and extremely hot.  "And your ship is made of that stuff!" exclaimed the Talsonian scientist. "What will destroy it?"  "Your weapon will, apparently."  "But do you believe that we have power enough?" asked Morey with a smile.  "No--it's entirely too much. Can you tone that condensed lightning bolt down to a workable level?"     Chapter IX  THE IRRESISTIBLE AND THE IMMOVABLE   The generator Arcot had brought was one of the two spare generators used for laboratory work. He took it now into the sub-station, and directed the Talsonian students and the scientist in the task of connecting it into the lines; though they knew where it belonged, he knew _how_ it belonged.  Then the terrestrian turned on the power, and gradually increased it until the power authorities were afraid of breakdowns. The accumulators were charged in the city, and the power was being shipped to other cities whose accumulators were not completely charged.  But, after giving simple operating instructions to the students, Arcot and Morey went with Stel Felso Theu to his laboratory.  "Here," Stel Felso Theu explained, "is the original apparatus. All these other machines you see are but replicas of this. How it works, why it works, even what it does, I am not sure of. Perhaps you will understand it. The thing is fully charged now, for it is, in part, one of the defenses of the city. Examine it now, and then I will show its power."  Arcot looked it over in silence, following the great silver leads with keen interest. Finally he straightened, and returned to the Talsonian. In a moment Morey joined them.  The Talsonian then threw a switch, and an intense ionization appeared within the tube, then a minute spot of light was visible within the sphere of light. The minute spot of radiance is the real secret of the weapon. The ball of fire around it is merely wasted energy.  "Now I will bring it out of the tube." There were three dials on the control panel from which he worked, and now he adjusted one of these. The ball of fire moved steadily toward the glass wall of the tube, and with a crash the glass exploded inward. It had been highly evacuated. Instantly the tiny ball of fire about the point of light expanded to a large globe.  "It is now in the outer air. We make the--thing, in an evacuated glass tube, but as they are cheap, it is not an expensive procedure. The ball will last in its present condition for approximately three hours. Feel the exceedingly intense heat? It is radiating away its vast energy.  "Now here is the point of greatest interest." Again the Talsonian fell to work on his dials, watching the ball of fire. It seemed far more brilliant in the air now. It moved, and headed toward a great slab of steel off to one side of the laboratory. It shifted about until it was directly over the center of the great slab. The slab rested on a scale of some sort, and as the ball of fire touched it, the scale showed a sudden increase in load. The ball sank into the slab of steel, and the scale showed a steady, enormous load. Evidently the little ball was pressing its way through as though it were a solid body. In a moment it was through the steel slab, and out on the other side.  "It will pass through any body with equal ease. It seems to answer only these controls, and these it answers perfectly, and without difficulty.  "One other thing we can do with it. I can increase its rate of energy discharge."  The Talsonian turned a fourth dial, well off to one side, and the brilliance of the spot increased enormously. The heat was unbearable. Almost at once he shut it off.  "That is the principle we use in making it a weapon. Watch the actual operation."  The ball of fire shot toward an open window, out the window, and vanished in the sky above. The Talsonian stopped the rotation of the dials. "It is motionless now, but scarcely visible. I will now release all the energy." He twirled the fourth dial, and instantly there was a flash of light, and a moment later a terrific concussion.  "It is gone." He left the controls, and went over to his apparatus. He set a heavy silver bladed switch, and placed a new tube in the apparatus. A second switch arced a bit as he drove it home. "Your generator is recharging the accumulators."  Stel Felso Theu took the backplate of the control cabinet off, and the terrestrians looked at the control with interest.  "Got it, Morey?" asked Arcot after a time.  "Think so. Want to try making it up? We can do so out of spare junk about the ship, I think. We won't need the tube if what I believe of it is true."  Arcot turned to the Talsonian. "We wish you to accompany us to the ship. We have apparatus there which we wish to set up."  Back to the ship they went. There Arcot, Morey and Wade worked rapidly.  It was about three-quarters of an hour later when Arcot and his friends called the others to the laboratory. They had a maze of apparatus on the power bench, and the shining relux conductors ran all over the ship apparently. One huge bar ran into the power room itself, and plugged into the huge power-coil power supply.  They were still working at it, but looked up as the others entered. "Guess it will work," said Arcot with a grin.  There were four dials, and three huge switches. Arcot set all four dials, and threw one of the switches. Then he started slowly turning the fourth dial. In the center of the room a dim, shining mist a foot in diameter began to appear. It condensed, solidified without shrinking, a solid ball of matter a foot in diameter. It seemed black, but was a perfectly reflective surface--and luminous!  "Then--then you had already known of this thing? Then why did you not tell me when I tried to show it?" demanded the Talsonian.  Arcot was sending the globe, now perfectly non-luminous, about the room. It flattened out suddenly, and was a disc. He tossed a small weight on it, and it remained fixed, but began to radiate slightly. Arcot readjusted his dials, and it ceased radiating, held perfectly motionless. The sphere returned, and the weight dropped to the floor. Arcot maneuvered it about for a moment more. Then he placed his friends behind a screen of relux, and increased the radiation of the globe tremendously. The heat became intense, and he stopped the radiation.  "No, Stel Felso Theu, we do not have this on our world," Arcot said.  "You do not have it! You look at my apparatus fifteen minutes, and then work for an hour--and you have apparatus far more effective than ours, which required years of development!" exclaimed the Talsonian.  "Ah, but it was not wholly new to me. This ship is driven by curving space into peculiar coordinates. Even so, we didn't do such a hot job, did we, Morey?"  "No, we should have--"  "What--it was not a good job?" interrupted the Talsonian. "You succeeded in creating it in air--in making it stop radiating, in making a ball a foot in diameter, made it change to a disc, made it carry a load--what do you want?"  "We want the full possibilities, the only thing that can save us in this war," Morey said.  "What you learned how to do was the reverse of the process we learned. How you did it is a wonder--but you did. Very well--matter is energy--does your physics know that?" asked Arcot.  "It does; matter contains vast energy," replied the Talsonian.  "Matter has mass, and energy because of that! Mass _is_ energy. Energy in any known form is a field of force in space. So matter is ordinarily a combination of magnetic, electrostatic and gravitational fields. Your apparatus combined the three, and put them together. The result was--matter!  "You created matter. We can destroy it but we cannot create it.  "What we ordinarily call matter is just a marker, a sign that there are those energy-fields. Each bit is surrounded by a gravitational field. The bit is just the marker of that gravitational field.  "But that seems to be wrong. This artificial matter of yours seems also a sort of knot, for you make all three fields, combine them, and have the matter, but not, very apparently, like normal matter. Normal matter also holds the fields that make it. The artificial matter is surrounded by the right fields, but it is evidently not able to hold the fields, as normal matter does. That was why your matter continually disintegrated to ordinary energy. The energy was not bound properly.  "But the reason why it would blow up so was obvious. It did not take much to destroy the slight hold that the artificial matter had on its field, and then it instantly proceeded to release all its energy at once. And as you poured millions of horsepower into it all day to fill it, it naturally raised merry hell when it let loose."  Arcot was speaking eagerly, excitedly.  "But here is the great fact, the important thing: It is artificially created in a given place. It is made, and exists at the point determined by these three coordinated dials. It is not natural, and can exist only where it is made and nowhere else--obvious, but important. It cannot exist save at the point designated. Then, if that point moves along a line, the artificial matter must follow that moving point and be always at that point. Suppose now that a slab of steel is on that line. The point moves to it--through it. To exist, that artificial matter _must_ follow it through the steel--if not, it is destroyed. Then the steel is attempting to destroy the artificial matter. If the matter has sufficient energy, it will force the steel out of the way, and penetrate. The same is true of any other matter, lux metal or relux--it will penetrate. To continue in existence it must. And it has great energy, and will expend every erg of that energy of existence to continue existence.  "It is, as long as its energy holds out, absolutely irresistible!  "But similarly, if it is at a given point, it must stay there, and will expend every erg staying there. It is then immovable! It is either irresistible in motion, or immovable in static condition. It is the irresistible and the immovable!  "What happens if the irresistible meets the immovable? It can only fight with its energy of existence, and the more energetic prevails."     Chapter X  IMPROVEMENTS AND CALCULATIONS   "It is still incredible. But you have done it. It is certainly successful!" said the Talsonian scientist with conviction.  Arcot shook his head. "Far from it--we have not realized a thousandth part of the tremendous possibilities of this invention. We must work and calculate and then invent.  "Think of the possibilities as a shield--naturally if we can make the matter we should be able to control its properties in any way we like. We should be able to make it opaque, transparent, or any color." Arcot was speaking to Morey now. "Do you remember, when we were caught in that cosmic ray field in space when we first left this universe, that I said that I had an idea for energy so vast that it would be impossible to describe its awful power?[1] I mentioned that I would attempt to liberate it if ever there was need? The need exists. I want to find that secret."  [Footnote 1: Islands of Space.]  Stel Felso Theu was looking out through the window at a group of men excitedly beckoning. He called the attention of the others to them, and himself went out. Arcot and Wade joined him in a moment.  "They tell me that Fellsheh, well to the poleward of here has used four of its eight shots. They are still being attacked," explained the Talsonian gravely.  "Well, get in," snapped Arcot as he ran back to the ship. Stel Felso hastily followed, and the _Ancient Mariner_ shot into the air, and darted away, poleward, to the Talsonian's directions. The ground fled behind them at a speed that made the scientist grip the hand-rail with a tenseness that showed his nervousness.  As they approached, a tremendous concussion and a great gout of light in the sky informed them of the early demise of several Thessians. But a real fleet was clustered about the city. Arcot approached low, and was able to get quite close before detection. His ray screen was up and Morey had charged the artificial matter apparatus, small as it was, for operation. He created a ball of substance outside the _Ancient Mariner_, and thrust it toward the nearest Thessian, just as a molecular hit the _Ancient Mariner'_s ray screen.  The artificial matter instantly exploded with terrific violence, slightly denting the tremendously strong lux metal walls. The pressure of the light was so great that the inner relux walls were dented inward. The ground below was suddenly, instantaneously fused.  "Lord--they won't pass a ray screen, obviously," Morey muttered, picking himself from where he had fallen.  "Hey--easy there. You blinked off the ray screen, and our relux is seriously weakened," called Arcot, a note of worry in his voice.  "No artificial matter with the ray screen up. I'll use the magnet," called Morey.  He quickly shut off the apparatus, and went to the huge magnet control. The power room was crowded, and now that the battle was raging in truth, with three ships attacking simultaneously, even the enormous power capacity of the ship's generators was not sufficient, and the storage coils had been thrown into the operation. Morey looked at the instruments a moment. They were all up to capacity, save the ammeter from the coils. That wasn't registering yet. Suddenly it flicked, and the other instrument dropped to zero. They were in artificial space.  "Come here, will you, Morey," called Arcot. In a moment Morey joined his much worried friend.  "That artificial matter control won't work through ray screens. The Thessians never had to protect against moleculars here, and didn't have them up--hence the destruction wrought. We can't take our screen down, and we can't use our most deadly weapon with it up. If we had a big outfit, we might throw a screen around the whole ship, and sail right in. But we haven't.  "We can't stand ten seconds against that fleet. I'm going to find their base, and make them yell for help." Arcot snapped a tiny switch one notch further for the barest instant, then snapped it back. They were several millions miles from the planet. "Quicker," he explained, "to simply follow those ships back home--go back in time."  With the telectroscope, he took views at various distances, thus quickly tracing them back to their base at the pole of the planet. Instantly Arcot shot down, reaching the pole in less than a second, by carefully maneuvering of the space device.  A gigantic dome of polished relux rose from rocky, icy plains. The thing was nearly half a mile high, a mighty rounded roof that covered an area almost three-quarters of a mile in diameter. Titanic--that was the only word that described it. About it there was the peculiar shimmer of a molecular ray screen.  Morey darted to the power room and set his apparatus into operation. He created a ball of matter outside the ship and hurled it instantly at the fort. It exploded with a terrific concussion as it hit the wall of the ray screen. Almost instantly a second one followed. The concussion was terrifically violent, the ground about was fused, and the ray screen was opened for a moment. Arcot threw all his moleculars on the screen, as Morey sent bomb after bomb at it. The coils supplied the energy, cracked the rock beneath. Each energy release disrupted the ray-screen for a moment, and the concentrated fury of the molecular beams poured through the opened screen, and struck the relux behind. It glowed opalescent now in a spot twenty feet across. But the relux was tremendously thick. Thirty bombs Morey hurled, while they held their position without difficulty, pouring their bombs and rays at the fort.  Arcot threw the ship into space, moved, and reappeared suddenly nearly three hundred yards further on. A snap of the eyes, and he saw that the fleet was approaching now. He went again into space, and retreated. Discretion was the better part of valor. But his plan had worked.  He waited half an hour, and returned. From a distance the telectroscope told him that one lone ship was patrolling outside the fort. He moved toward it, creeping up behind the icy mountains. His magnetic beam reached out. The ship lurched and fell. The magnetic beam reached out toward the fort, from which a molecular ray had flashed already, tearing up the icy waste which had concealed him. The ray-screen stopped it, while again Morey turned the magnetic beam on--this time against the fort. The ray remained on! Arcot retreated hastily.  "They found the secret, all right. No use, Morey, come on up," called the pilot. "They evidently put magnetic shielding around the apparatus. That means the magnetic beam is no good to us any more. They will certainly warn every other base, and have them install similar protection."  "Why didn't you try the magnetic ray on our first attack?" asked Zezdon Afthen.  "If it had worked, their sending apparatus would have been destroyed, and no message could have been sent to call their attackers off Fellsheh. By forcing them to recall their fleet I got results I couldn't get by attacking the fleet," Arcot said.  "I think there is little more I can do here, Stel Felso Theu. I will take you to Shesto, and there make final arrangements till my return, with apparatus capable of overthrowing your enemies. If you wish to accompany me--you may." He glanced around at the others of his party. "And our next move will be to return to Earth with what we have. Then we will investigate the Sirian planets, and learn anything they may have of interest, thence--to the real outer space, the utter void of intergalactic space, and an attempt to learn the secret of that enormous power."  They returned to Shesto, and there Arcot arranged that the only generator they could spare, the one already in their possession, might be used till other terrestrian ships could bring more. They left for Earth. Hour after hour they fled through the void, till at last old Sol was growing swiftly ahead of them, and finally Earth itself was large on the screens. They changed to a straight molecular drive, and dropped to the Vermont field from which they had taken off.  During the long voyage, Morey and Arcot had both spent much of the time working on the time-distortion field, which would give them a tremendous control over time, either speeding or slowing their time rate enormously. At last, this finished, they had worked on the artificial matter theory, to the point where they could control the shape of the matter perfectly, though as yet they could not control its exact nature. The possibility of such control was, however, definitely proven by the results the machines had given them. Arcot had been more immediately interested in the control of form. He could control the nature as to opacity or transparency to all vibrations that normal matter is opaque or transparent to. Light would pass, or not as he chose, but cosmics he could not stop nor would radio or moleculars be stopped by any present shield he could make.  They had signaled, as soon as they slowed outside the atmosphere, and when they settled to the field, Arcot's father and a number of very important scientists had already arrived.  Arcot senior greeted his son very warmly, but he was tremendously worried, as his son soon saw.  "What's happened, Dad--won't they believe your statements?"  "They doubted when I went to Luna for a session with the Interplanetary Council, but before they could say much, they had plenty of proof of my statements," the older man answered. "News came that a fleet of Planetary Guard ships had been wiped out by a fleet of ships from outer space. They were huge things--nearly half a mile in length. The Guard ships went up to them--fifty of them--and tried to signal for a conference. The white ship was instantly wiped out--we don't know how. They didn't have ray screens, but that wasn't it. Whatever it was--slightly luminous ray in space--it simply released the energy of the lux metal and relux of the ship. Being composed of light energy simply bound by photonic attraction, it let go with terrible energy. They can do it almost instantly from a distance. The other Guards at once let loose with all their moleculars and cosmics. The enemy shunted off the moleculars, and wiped out the Guard almost instantly.  "Of course, I could explain the screen, but not the detonation ray. I am inclined to believe from other casualties that the destruction, though reported as an instantaneous explosion, was not that. Other ships have been destroyed, and they seemed to catch fire, and burn, but with terrific speed, more like gun powder than coal. It seems to start a spreading decomposition, the ship lasts perhaps ten minutes. If it went instantly, the shock of such a tremendous energy release would disrupt the planet.  "At any rate, the great fleet separated, twelve went to the North Pole of Earth, twelve to the south, and similarly twelve to each pole of Venus. Then one of them turned, and went back to wherever it had come from, to report. Just turned and vanished. Similarly one from Venus turned and vanished. That leaves twelve at each of the four poles, for, as I said, there were an even fifty.  "They all followed the same tactics on landing, so I'll simply tell what happened in Attica. In the North they had to pick one of the islands a bit to the south of the pole. They melted about a hundred square miles of ice to find one.  "The ships arranged themselves in a circle around the place, and literally hundreds of men poured out of each and fell to work. In a short time, they had set up a number of machines, the parts coming from the ships. These machines at once set to work, and they built up a relux wall. That wall was at least six feet thick; the floor was lined with thick relux as well as the roof, which is simply a continuation of the wall in a perfect dome. They had so many machines working on it, that within twenty-four hours they had it finished.  "We attacked twice, once in practically our entire force, with some ray-shield machines. The result was disastrous. The second attack was made with ray shielded machines only, and little damage was done to either side, though the enemy were somewhat impeded by masses of ice hurled into their position. Their relux disintegration ray was conspicuous by its absence.  "Yesterday--and it seems a lot longer than that, son--they started it again. They'd been unloading it from the ship evidently. We had had ray-shielded machines out, but they simply melted. They went down, and Earth retreated. They're in their fortress now. We don't know how to fight them. Now, for God's sake, tell us you have learned of some weapon, son!"  The older man's face was lined. His iron gray head showed his fatigue due to hours of concentration on his work.  "Some," replied Arcot briefly. He glanced around. Other men had arrived, men whom he met in his work. But there were Venerians here, too, in their protective suits, insulated against the cold of Earth, and against its atmosphere.  "First, though, gentlemen, allow me to introduce Stel Felso Theu of the planet Talso, one of our allies in this struggle, and Zezdon Afthen and Fentes of Ortol, one of our other allies.  "As to progress, I can say only that it is in a more or less rudimentary stage. We have the basis for great progress, a weapon of inestimable value--but it is only the basis. It must be worked out. I am leaving with you today the completed calculations and equations of the time field, the system used by the Thessian invaders in propelling their ships at a speed greater than that of light. Also, the uncompleted calculations in regard to another matter, a weapon which our ally, Talso, has given us, in exchange for the aid we gave in allowing them the use of one of our generators. Unfortunately the ship could not spare more than the single generator. I strongly advise rushing a number of generators to Talso in intergalactic freighters. They badly need power--power of respectable dimensions.  "I have stopped on Earth only temporarily, and I want to leave as soon as possible. I intend, however, to attempt an attack on the Arctic base of the Thessians, in strong hopes that they have not armored against one weapon that the _Ancient Mariner_ carries--though I sadly fear that old Earth herself has played us false here. I hope to use the magnetic beam, but Earth's polar magnetism may have forced them to armor, and they may have sufficiently heavy material to block the effects."  Morey already had a ground crew servicing the ship. He gave designs to machinists on hand to make special control panels for the large artificial matter machines. Arcot and Wade got some badly needed equipment.  In six hours, Arcot had announced himself ready, and a squadron of Planetary Guard ships were ready to accompany the refitted _Ancient Mariner_.  They approached the pole cautiously, and were rewarded by the hiss and roar of ice melting into water which burst into steam under a ray. It was coming from an outpost of the camp, a tiny dome under a great mass of ice. But the dome was of relux. A molecular reached down from a Guard ship--and the Guard ship crumbled suddenly as dozens of moleculars from the points hit it.  "They know how to fight this kind of a war. That's their biggest advantage," muttered Arcot. Wade merely swore.  "Ray screens, no moleculars!" snapped Arcot into the transmitter. He was not their leader, but they saw his wisdom, and the squadron commander repeated the advice as an order. In the meantime, another ship had fallen. The dome had its screen up, allowing the multitudes of hidden stations outside to fight for it.  "Hmm--something to remember when terrestrians have to retire to forts. They will, too, before this war is over. That way the main fort doesn't have to lower its ray screen to fight," commented Arcot. He was watching intensely as a tiny ship swung away from one of the larger machines, and a tremendously powerful molecular started biting at the fort's ray screen. The ship seemed nothing but a flying ray projector, which was what it was.  As they had hoped, the deadly new ray stabbed out from somewhere on the side of the fort. It was not within the fort.  "Which means," pointed out Morey, "that they can't make stuff to stand that. Probably the projector would be vulnerable."  But a barrage of heat rays which immediately followed had no apparent effect. The little radio-controlled molecular beam projector lay on the rock under the melted ice, blazing incandescent with the rapidly released energy of the relux.  "Now to try the real test we came here for," Morey clambered back to the power room, and turned on the controls of the magnetic beam. The ship was aligned, and then he threw the last switch. The great mass of the machine jerked violently, and plunged forward as the beam attracted the magnetic core of the Earth.  Morey could not see it, but almost instantly the shimmer of the molecular screen on the fort died out. The deadly ray sprang out from the Thessian projector--and went dead. Frantically the Thessians tried weapon after weapon, and found them dead almost as soon as they were turned on--which was the natural result in the terrific magnetic field.  And these men had iron bones, their very bones were attracted by the beam; they plunged upward toward the ship as the beam touched them, but, accustomed to the enormous gravitation accelerations of an enormous world, most of them were not killed.  "Ah--!" exclaimed Arcot. He picked up the transmitter and spoke again to the Squadron Commander. "Squadron Commander Tharnton, what relux thickness does your ship carry?"  "Inch and a quarter," replied the surprised voice of the commander.  "Any of the other ships carry heavier?"  "Yes, the special solar investigator carries five inches. What shall we do?"  "Tell him to lower his screen, and let loose at once on all operating forts. His relux will stand for the time needed to shut them down for their own screens, unless some genius decides to fight it out. As soon as the other ships can lower their screens, tell them to do so, and tell them to join in. I'll be able to help then. My relux has been burned, and I'm afraid to lower the screen. It's mighty thin already."  The squadron commander was smiling joyously as he relayed the advice as a command.  Almost at once a single ship, blunt, an almost perfect cylinder, lowered its screen. In an instant the opalescence of the transformation showed on it, but its dozen ray projectors were at work. Fort after fort glowed opalescent, then flashed into protective ionization of screening. Quickly other ships lowered their screens, and joined in. In a moment more, the forts had been forced to raise their screens for protection.  A disc of artificial matter ten feet across suddenly appeared beside the _Ancient Mariner_. It advanced with terrific speed, struck the great dome of the fort, and the dome caved, bent in, bent still more--but would not puncture. The disc retreated, became a sharp cone, and drove in again. This time the point smashed through the relux, and made a small hole. The cone seemed to change gradually, melting into a cylinder of twenty foot diameter, and the hole simply expanded. It continued to expand as the cylinder became a huge disc, a hundred feet across, set in the wall.  Suddenly it simply dissolved. There was a terrific roar, and a mighty column of white rushed out of the gaping hole. Figures of Thessians caught by the terrific current came rocketing out. The inside was at last visible. The terrific pressure was hurling the outside line of ships about like thistledown. The _Ancient Mariner_ reeled back under the tremendous blast of expanding gas. The snow that fell to the boiling water below was not water, _in toto_; some was carbon dioxide--and some oxygen chilled in the expansion of the gas. It was snowing within the dome. The falling forms of Thessians were robbed of the life-giving air pressure to which they were accustomed. But all this was visible for but an instant.  Then a small, thin sheet of artificial matter formed beside the fort, and advanced on the dome. Like a knife cutting open an orange, it simply went around the dome's edge, the great dome lifted like the lid of a teapot under the enormous gas pressure remaining--then dropped under its own weight.  The artificial matter was again a huge disc. It settled over the exact center of the dome--and went down. The dome caved in. It was crushed under a load utterly inestimable. Then the great disc, like some monstrous tamper, tamped the entire works of the Thessians into the bed-rock of the island. Every ship, every miniature fort, every man was caught under it--and annihilated.  The disc dissolved. A terrific barrage of heat beams played over the island, and the rock melted, flowed over the ruins, and left only the spumes of steam from the Arctic ice rising from a red-hot: mass of rock, contained a boiling pool.  The Battle of the Arctic was done.     Chapter XI  "WRITE OFF THE MAGNET"   "Squadron commander Tharnton speaking: Squadron 73-B of Planetary Guard will follow orders from Dr. Arcot directly. Heading south to Antarctica at maximum speed," droned the communicator. Under the official tone of command was a note of suppressed rage and determination. "And the squadron commander wishes Dr. Arcot every success in wiping out Antarctica as thoroughly and completely as he destroyed the Arctic base."  The flight of ships headed south at a speed that heated them white in the air, thin as it was at the hundred mile altitude, yet going higher would have taken unnecessary time, and the white heat meant no discomfort. They reached Antarctica in about ten minutes. The Thessian ships were just entering through great locks in the walls of the dome. At first sight of the terrestrial ships they turned, and shot toward the guard-ships. Their screens were down, for, armored as they were with very heavy relux they expected to be able to overcome the terrestrial thin relux before theirs was seriously impaired.  "Ships will put up screens." Arcot spoke sharply--a new plan had occurred to him. The moleculars of the Thessians Struck glowing screens, and no damage was done. "Ships, in order of number, will lower screen for thirty seconds, and concentrate all moleculars on one ship--the leader. Solar investigator will not join in action."  The flagship of the squadron lowered its screen, and a tremendous bombardment of rays struck the leading ship practically in one point. The relux glowed, and the opalescence shifted with bewildering, confusing colors. Then the terrestrial ship's screen was up, before the Thessians could concentrate on the one unprotected ship. Immediately another terrestrial ship opened its screen and bombarded the same ship. Two others followed--and then it was forced to use its screen.  But suddenly a terrestrial ship crashed. Its straining screen had been overworked--and it failed.  Arcot's magnetic beam went into action. The Thessian ray did not go out--it flickered, dimmed, but was apparently as deadly as ever.  "Shielded--write off the magnet, Morey. That is one asset we lose."  Arcot, protected in space, was thinking swiftly. Moleculars--useless. They had to keep their own screens up. Artificial matter--bound in by their own molecular screen! And the magnet had failed them against the protected mechanism of the dome. The ships were not as yet protected, but the dome was.  "Guess the only place we'd be safe is under the ground--way under!" commented Wade dryly.  "Under the ground--Wade, you're a genius!" Arcot gave a shout of joy, and told Wade to take over the ship.  "Take the ship back into normal space, head for the hill over behind the Dome, and drop behind it. It's solid rock, and even their rays will take a moment or so to move it. As soon as you get there, drop to the ground, and turn off the screen. No--here, I'll do it. You just take it there, land on the ground, and shut off the screen. I promise the rest!" Arcot dived for the artificial matter room.  The ship was suddenly in normal space; its screen up. The dog-fight had been ended. The terrestrial ships had been completely defeated. The _Ancient Mariner'_s appearance was a signal for all the moleculars in sight. Ten huge ships, half a dozen small forts and now the unshielded Dome, joined in. Their screen tubes heated up violently in the brief moment it took to dive behind the hill, a tube fused, and blew out. Automatic devices shunted it, another tube took the load--and heated. But their screen was full of holes before they were safe for the moment behind the hill.  Instantly Wade dropped the defective screen. Almost as quickly as the screen vanished, a cylinder of artificial matter surrounded the entire ship. The cylinder was tipped by a perfect cone of the same base diameter. The entire system settled into the solid rock. The rock above cracked and filled in behind them. The ship was suddenly pushed by the base of the cylinder behind them, and drove on through the rock, the cone parting the hard granite ahead. They went perhaps half a mile, then stopped. In the light of the ship's windows, they could see the faint mistiness of the inconceivably hard, artificial matter, and beyond the slick, polished surface of the rock it was pushing aside. The cone shape was still there.  There was a terrific roar behind them, the rock above cracked, shifted and moved about.  "Raying the spot where we went down," Arcot grinned happily.  The cone and cylinder merged, shifted together, and became a sphere. The sphere elongated upward and the _Ancient Mariner_ turned in it, till it, too, pointed upward. The sphere became an ellipsoid.  Suddenly the ship was moving, accelerating terrifically. It plowed through the solid rock, and up--into a burst of light. They were _inside_ the dome. Great ships were berthed about the floor. Huge machines bulked here and there--barracks for men--everything.  The ellipsoid shrank to a sphere, the sphere grew a protuberance which separated and became a single bar-like cylinder. The cylinder turned, and drove through the great dome wall. A little hole but it whirled rapidly around, sliced the top off neatly and quickly. Again, like a gigantic teapot lid, the whole great structure lifted, settled, and stayed there. Men, scrambling wildly toward ships, suddenly stopped, seemed to blur and their features ran together horribly. They fell--and were dead in an instant as the air disappeared. In another instant they were solid blocks of ice, for the temperature was below the freezing point of carbon dioxide.  The giant tamper set to work. The Thessian ships went first. They were all crumpled, battered wrecks in a few seconds of work of the terrible disc.  The dome was destroyed. Arcot tried something else. He put on his control machine the equation of a hyperboloid of two branches, and changed the constants gradually till the two branches came close. Then he forced them against each other. Instantly they fought, fought terribly for existence. A tremendous blast of light and heat exploded into being. The energy of two tons of lead attempted to maintain those two branches. It was not, fortunately, explosive, and it took place over a relux floor. Most of the energy escaped into space. The vast flood of light was visible on Venus, despite the clouds.  But it fused most of Antarctica. It destroyed the last traces of the camp in Antarctica.  "Well--the Squadron was wiped out, I see." Arcot's voice was flat as he spoke. The Squadron: twenty ships--four hundred men.  "Yes--but so is the Arctic camp, and the Antarctic camp, as well," replied Wade.  "What next, Arcot. Shall we go out to intergalactic space at once?" asked Morey, coming up from the power room.  "No, we'll go back to Vermont, and have the time-field stuff I ordered installed, then go to Sirius, and see what they have. They moved their planets from the gravitation field of Negra, their dead, black star, to the field of Sirius--and I'd like to know how they did it.[2] Then--Intergalactia." He started the ship toward Vermont, while Morey got into communication with the field, and gave them a brief report.  [Footnote 2: "The Black Star Passes."]     Chapter XII  SIRIUS   They landed about half an hour later, and Arcot simply went into the cottage, and slept--with the aid of a light soporific. Morey and Wade directed the disposition of the machines, but Dr. Arcot senior really finished the job. The machines would be installed in less than ten hours, for the complete plans Arcot and Morey had made, with the modern machines for translating plans to metal and lux had made the actual construction quick, while the large crew of men employed required but little time.  When Arcot and his friends awoke, the machines were ready.  "Well, Dad, you have the plans for all the machines we have. I expect to be back in two weeks. In the meantime you might set up a number of ships with very heavy relux walls, walls that will stand rays for a while, and equip them with the rudimentary artificial matter machines you have, and go ahead with the work on the calculations. Thett will land other machines here--or on the moon. Probably they will attempt to ray the whole Earth. They won't have concentration of ray enough to move the planet, or to seriously chill it. But life is a different matter--it's sensitive. It is quite apt to let go even under a mild ray. I think that a few exceedingly powerful ray screen stations might be set up, and the Heavyside Layer used to transmit the vibrations entirely around the Earth. You can see the idea easily enough. If you think it worthwhile--or better, if you can convince the thickheaded politicians of the Interplanatary Defense Commission that it is--  "Beyond that, I'll see you in about two weeks," Arcot turned, and entered the ship.  "I'll line up for Sirius and let go." Arcot turned the ship now, for Earth was well behind, and lined it on Sirius, bright in the utter black of space. He pushed his control to "1/2," and the space closed in about them. Arcot held it there while the chronometer moved through six and a half seconds. Sirius was at a distance almost planetary in its magnitude from them. Controlling directly now, he brought the ship closer, till a planet loomed large before them--a large world, its rocky continents, its rolling oceans and jagged valleys white under the enormous energy-flood from the gigantic star of Sirius, twenty-six times more brilliant than the sun they had left.  "But, Arcot, hadn't you better take it easy?" Wade asked. "They might take us for enemies--which wouldn't be so good."  "I suppose it would be wise to go slowly. I had planned, as a matter of fact, on looking up a Thessian ship, taking a chance on a fight, and proving our friendship," replied Arcot.  Morey saw Arcot's logic--then suddenly burst into laughter. "Absolutely--attack a Thessian. But since we don't see any around now, we'll have to make one!"  Wade was completely mystified, and gave Morey a doubtful, sarcastic look. "Sounds like a good idea, only I wonder if this constant terrific mental strain--"  "Come along and find out!" Arcot threw the ship into artificial space for safety, holding it motionless. The planet, invisible to them, retreated from their motionless ship.  In the artificial matter control room, Arcot set to work, and developed a very considerable string of forms on his board, the equations of their formations requiring all the available formation controls.  "Now," said Arcot at last, "you stay here, Morey, and when I give the signal, create the thing back of the nearest range of hills, raise it, and send it toward us."  At once they returned to normal space, and darted down toward the now distant planet. They landed again near another city, one which was situated close to a range of mountains ideally suited to their purposes. They settled, while Zezdon Afthen sent out the message of friendship. He finally succeeded in getting some reaction, a sensation of scepticism, of distrust--but of interest. They needed friends, and only hoped that these were friends. Arcot pushed a little signal button, and Morey began his share of the play. From behind a low hill a slim, pointed form emerged, a beautifully streamlined ship, the lines obviously those of a Thessian, the windows streaming light, while the visible ionization about the hull proclaimed its molecular ray screen. Instantly Zezdon Afthen, who had carefully refrained from learning the full nature of their plans, felt the intense emotion of the discovery, called out to the others, while his thoughts were flashed to the Sirians below.  From the attacking ship, a body shot with tremendous speed, it flashed by, barely missing the _Ancient Mariner_, and buried itself in the hillside beyond. With a terrific explosion it burst, throwing the soil about in a tremendous crater. The _Ancient Mariner_ spun about, turned toward the other ship, and let loose a tremendous bombardment of molecular and cosmic rays. A great flame of ionized air was the only result. A new ray reached out from the other ship, a fan-like spreading ray. It struck the _Ancient Mariner_, and did not harm it, though the hillside behind was suddenly withered and blackened, then smoking as the temperature rose.  Another projectile was launched from the attacking ship, and exploded terrifically but a few hundred feet from the _Ancient Mariner_. The terrestrial ship rocked and swayed, and even the distant attacker rocked under the explosion.  A projectile, glowing white, leaped from the Earthship. It darted toward the enemy ship, seemed to barely touch it, then burst into terrific flames that spread, eating the whole ship, spreading glowing flame. In an instant the blazing ship slumped, started to fall, then seemingly evaporated, and before it touched the ground, was completely gone.  The relief in Zezdon Afthen's mind was genuine, and it was easily obvious to the Sirians that the winning ship was friendly, for, with all its frightful armament, it had downed a ship obviously of Thett. Though not exactly like the others, it had the all too familiar lines.  "They welcome us now," said Zezdon Afthen's mental message to his companions.  "Tell them we'll be there--with bells on or thoughts to that effect," grinned Arcot. Morey had appeared in the doorway, smiling broadly.  "How was the show?" he asked.  "Terrible--Why didn't you let it fall, and break open?"  "What would happen to the wreckage as we moved?" he asked sarcastically. "I thought it was a darned good demonstration."  "It was convincing," laughed Arcot. "They want us now!"  The great ship circled down, landing gently just outside of the city. Almost at once one of the slim, long Sirian ships shot up from a courtyard of the city, racing out and toward the _Ancient Mariner_. Scarcely a moment later half a hundred other ships from all over the city were on the way. Sirians seemed quite humanly curious.  "We'll have to be careful here. We have to use altitude suits, as the Negrians breathe an atmosphere of hydrogen instead of oxygen," explained Arcot rapidly to the Ortolian and the Talsonian who were to accompany him. "We will all want to go, and so, although this suit will be decidedly uncomfortable for you and Zezdon Afthen and Stel Felso Theu, I think it wise that you all wear it. It will be much more convincing to the Sirians if we show that people of no less than three worlds are already interested in this alliance."  A considerable number of Sirian ships had landed about them, and the tall, slim men of the 100,000,000-year-old race were watching them with their great brown eyes from a slight distance, for a cordon of men with evident authority were holding them back.  "Who are you, friends?" asked a single man who stood within the cordon. His strongly built frame, a great high brow and broad head designated him a leader at a glance.  Despite the vast change the light of Sirius had wrought, Arcot recognized in him the original photographs he had seen from the planet old Sol had captured as Negra had swept past. So it was he who answered the thought-question.  "I am of the third planet of the sun your people sought as a home a few years back in time, Taj Lamor. Because you did not understand us, and because we did not understand you, we fought. We found the records of your race on the planet our sun captured, and we know now what you most wanted. Had we been able to communicate with you then, as we can now, our people would never have fought.  "At last you have reached that sun you so needed, thanks, no doubt, to the genius that was with you.  "But now, in your new-found peace comes a new enemy, one who wants not only yours, but every sun in this galaxy.  "You have tried your ray of death, the anti-catalyst? And it but sputters harmlessly on their screens? You have been swept by their terrible rays that fuse mountains, then hurl them into space? Our world and the world of each of these men is similarly menaced.  "See, here is Zezdon Afthen, from Ortol, far on the other side of the galaxy, and here is Stel Felso Theu, of Talso. Their worlds, as well as yours and mine have been attacked by this menace from a distant galaxy, from Thett, of the sun Ansteck, of the galaxy Venone.  "Now we must form an alliance of far wider scope than ever has existed before.  "To you we have come, for your race is older by far than any race of our alliance. Your science has advanced far higher. What weapons have you discovered among those ancient documents, Taj Lamor? We have one weapon that you no doubt need; a screen, which will stop the rays of the molecule director apparatus. What have you to offer us?"  "We need your help badly," was the reply. "We have been able to keep them from landing on our planets, but it has cost us much. They have landed on a planet we brought with us when we left the black star, but it is not inhabited. From this as a base they have made attacks on us. We tried throwing the planet into Sirius. They merely left the planet hurriedly as it fell toward the star, and broke free from our attractive ray."  "The attractive ray! Then you have uncovered that secret?" asked Arcot eagerly.  Taj Lamor had some of his men bring an attractive ray projector to the ship. The apparatus turned out to be nearly a thousand tons in weight, and some twenty feet long, ten feet wide and approximately twelve feet high. It was impossible to load the huge machine into the _Ancient Mariner_, so an examination was conducted on the spot, with instruments whose reading was intelligible to the terrestrians operating it. Its principal fault lay in the fact that, despite the enormous energy of matter given out, the machine still gobbled up such titanic amounts of energy before the attraction could be established, that a very large machine was needed. The ray, so long as maintained, used no more power than was actually expended in moving the planet or other body. The power used while the ray was in action corresponded to the work done, but a tremendous power was needed to establish it, and this power could never be recovered.  Further, no reaction was produced in the machine, no matter what body it was turned upon. In swinging a planet then, a spaceship could be used as the base for the reaction was not exerted on the machine.  From such meager clues, and the instruments, Arcot got the hints that led him to the solution of the problem, for the documents, from which Taj Lamor had gotten his information, had been disastrously wiped out, when one of their cities fell, and Taj Lamor had but copied the machines of his ancestors.  The immense value of these machines was evident, for they would permit Arcot to do many things that would have been impossible without them. The explanation as he gave it to Stel Felso Theu, foretold the uses to which it might be put.  "As a weapon," he pointed out, "its most serious fault is that it takes a considerable time to pump in the power needed. It has here, practically the same fault which the artificial matter had on your world.  "As I see it, the ray is actually a directed gravitational field.  "Now here is one thing that makes it more interesting, and more useful. It seems to defy the laws of mechanics. It acts, but there is no apparent reaction! A small ship can swing a world! Remember, the field that generates the attraction is an integral, interwoven part of the mesh of Space. It is created by something outside of itself. Like the artificial matter, it exists there, and there alone. There is reaction on that attractive field, but it is created in Space at that given point, and the reaction is taken by all Space. No wonder it won't move.  "The work considerations are fairly obvious. The field is built up. That takes energy. The beam is focused on a body, the body falls nearer, and immediately absorbs the energy in acquiring a velocity. The machine replenishes the energy, because it is set to maintain a certain energy-level in the field. Therefore the machine must do the work of moving the ship, just as though it were a driving apparatus. After the beam has done what is wanted, it may be shut off, and the energy in the field is now available for any work needed. It may be drained back into power coils such as ours for instance, or one might just spend that last iota of power on the job.  "As a driving device it might be set to pull the entire ship along, and still not have any acceleration detectable to the occupants.  "I think we'll use that on our big ship," he finished, his eyes far away on some future idea.  "Natural gravity of natural matter is, luckily, not selective. It goes in all directions. But this artificial gravity is controlled so that it does not spread, and the result is that the mass-attraction of a mass of matter does not fall off as the inverse square of the distance, but like the ray from the parallel beam spotlight, continues undiminished.  "Actually, they create an exceedingly intense, exceedingly small gravitational field, and direct it in a straight line. The building up of this field is what takes time."  Zezdon Afthen, who had a question which was troubling him, looked anxiously at his friends. Finally he broke into their thoughts which had been too cryptically abbreviated for him to follow, like the work of a professor solving some problem, his steps taken so swiftly and so abbreviated that their following was impossible to his students.  "But how is it that the machine is not moved when exerting such force on some other body?" he asked at last.  "Oh, the ray concentrates the gravitational force, and projects it. The actual strain is in space. It is space that takes the strain, but in normal cases, unless the masses are very large, no considerable acceleration is produced over any great distance. That law operates in the case of the pulled body; it pulls the gravitational field as a normal field, the inverse-square law applying.  "But on the other hand, the gravity-beam pulls with a constant force.  "It might be likened to the light-pressure effects of a spotlight and a star. The spotlight would push the sun with a force that was constant; no matter what the distance, while the light pressure of the sun would vary as the inverse square of the distance.  "But remember, it is not a body that pulls another body, but a gravitational field that pulls another. The field is in space. A normal field is necessarily attached to the matter that it represents, or that represents it as you prefer, but this artificial field has no connection in the form of matter. It is a product of a machine, and exists only as a strain in space. To move it you must move all space, since it, like artificial matter, exists only where it is created in space.  "Do you see now why the law of action and reaction is apparently flouted? Actually the reaction is taken up by space."  Arcot rose, and stretched. Morey and Wade had been looking at him, and now they asked when he intended leaving for the intergalactic spaces.  "Now, I think. We have a lot of work to do. At present we have the mathematics of the artificial matter to carry on, and the math of the artificial gravity to develop. We gave the Sirians all we had on artificial matter and on moleculars.  "They gave us all they had--which wasn't much beyond the artificial gravity, and a lot of work. At any rate, let's go!"     Chapter XIII  ATTACKED   The _Ancient Mariner_ stirred, and rose lightly from its place beside the city. Visible over the horizon now, and coming at terrific speed, was a fleet of seven Thessian ships.  They must do their best to protect that city. Arcot turned the ship and called his decision to Morey. As he did so, one of the Thessian ships suddenly swerved violently, and plunged downward. The attractive ray was in action. It struck the rocks of Neptune, and plunged in. Half buried, it stopped. Stopped--and backed out! The tremendously strong relux and lux had withstood the blow, and these strange, inhumanly powerful men had not been injured!  Two of the ships darted toward him simultaneously, flashing out molecular rays. The rays glanced off of Arcot's screen already in place, but the tubes were showing almost at once that this could not be sustained. It was evident that the swiftly approaching ships would soon break down the shields. Arcot turned the ship and drove to one side. His eyes went dead.  He cut into artificial space, waited ten seconds, then cut back. The scene before him changed. It seemed a different world. The light was very dim, so dim he could scarcely see the images on the view plate. They were so deep a red that they were very near to black. Even Sirius, the flaming blue-white star was red. The darting Thessian ships were moving quite slowly now, moving at a speed that was easy to follow. Their rays, before ionizing the air brilliantly red, were now dark. The instruments showed that the screen was no longer encountering serious loading, and, further, the load was coming in at a frequency harmlessly far down the radio spectrum!  Arcot stared in wide-eyed amazement. What could the Thessians have done that caused this change? He reached up and increased the amplification on the eyes to a point that made even the dim illumination sufficient. Wade was staring in amazement, too.  "Lord! What an idea!" suddenly exclaimed Arcot.  Wade was staring at Arcot in equally great amazement. "What's the secret?" he asked.  "Time, man, time! We are in an advanced time plane, living faster than they, our atoms of fuel are destroyed faster, our second is shorter. In one second of our earthly time our generators do the same amount of work as usual, but they do many, many times more work in one second, of the time we were in! We are under the advanced time field."  Wade could see it all. The red light--normal light seen through eyes enormously speeded in all perceptions. The change, the dimness--dim because less energy reached them per second of their time. Then came this blue light, as they reached the X-ray spectrum of Sirius, and saw X-rays as normal light--shielded, tremendously shielded by the atmosphere, but the enormous amplification of the eyes made up for it.  The remaining Thessians seemed to get the idea simultaneously, and started for Arcot in his own time field. The Thessian ship appeared to be actually leaping at him. Suddenly, his speed increased inconceivably. Simultaneously, Arcot's hand, already started toward the space-control switch, reached it, and pushed it to the point that threw the ship into artificial Space. The last glimmer of light died suddenly, as the Thessian ship's bow loomed huge beside the _Ancient Mariner_.  There was a terrific shock that hurled the ship violently to one side, threw the men about inside the ship. Simultaneously the lights blinked out.  Light returned as the automatic emergency incandescent lights in the room, fed from an energy store coil, flashed on abruptly. The men were white-faced, tense in their positions. Swiftly Morey was looking over the indicators on his remote-reading panel, while Arcot stared at the few dials before the actual control board.  "_There's an air pressure outside the ship!_" he cried out in surprise. "High oxygen, very little nitrogen, breathable apparently, provided there are no poisons. Temperature ten below zero C."  "Lights are off because relays opened when the crash short circuited them." Morey and the entire group were suddenly shaking.  "Nervous shock," commented Zezdon Afthen. "It will be an hour or more before we will be in condition to work."  "Can't wait," replied Arcot testily, his nerves on edge, too.  "Morey, make some good strong coffee if you can, and we'll waste a little air on some smokes."  Morey rose and went to the door that led through the main passage to the galley. "Heck of a job--no weight at all," he muttered. "There is air in the passage, anyway." He opened the door, and the air rushed from the control room to the passage till the pressure was equalized. The door to the power room was shut, but it was bulged, despite its two-inch lux metal, and through its clear material he could see the wreckage of the power room.  "Arcot," he called. "Come here and look at the power room. Quintillions of miles from home, we can't shut off this field now."  Arcot was with him in a moment. The tremendous mass of the nose of the Thessian ship had caught them full amid-ship, and the powerful ram had driven through the room. Their lux walls had not been touched; only a sledge-hammer blow would have bent them under any circumstances, let alone breaking them. But the tremendously powerful main generator was split wide open. And the mechanical damage was awful. The prow of the ship had been driven deep into the machine, and the power room was a wreck.  "And," pointed out Morey, "we can't handle a job like that. It will take a tremendous amount of machinery back on a planet to work that stuff, and we couldn't bend that bar, let alone fix it."  "Get the coffee, will you please, Morey? I have an idea that's bound to work," said Arcot looking fixedly at the machinery.  Morey turned and went to the galley.  Five minutes later they returned to the corridor, where Arcot stood still, looking fixedly at the engine room. They were carrying small plastic balloons with coffee in them.  They drank the coffee and returned to the control room, and sat about, the terrestrians smoking peacefully, the Ortolian and the Talsonian satisfying themselves with some form of mild narcotic from Ortol, which Zezdon Afthen introduced.  "Well, we have a lot more to do," Arcot said. "The air-apparatus stopped working a while back, and I don't want to sit around doing nothing while the air in the storage tanks is used up. Did you notice our friends, the enemy?" Through the great pilot's window the bulk of the Thessian ship's bow could be seen. It was cut across with an exactitude of mathematical certainty.  "Easy to guess what happened," Morey grinned. "They may have wrecked us, but we sure wrecked them. They got half in and half out of our space field. Result--the half that was in, stayed in. The half that was out stayed out. The two halves were instantaneously a billion miles apart, and that beautifully exact surface represents the point our space cut across.  "That being decided, the next question is how to fix this poor old wreck." Morey grinned a bit. "Better, how to get out of here, and down to old Neptune."  "Fix it!" replied Arcot. "Come on; you get in your space suit, take the portable telectroscope and set it up in space, motionless, in such a position that it views both our ship and the nose of the Thessian machine, will you, Wade? Tune it to--seven-seven-three." Morey rose with Arcot, and followed him, somewhat mystified, down the passage. At the airlock Wade put on his space suit, and the Ortolian helped him with it. In a moment the other three men appeared bearing the machine. It was practically weightless, though it would fall slowly if left to itself, for the mass of the _Ancient Mariner_ and the front end of the Thessian ship made a considerable attractive field. But it was clumsy, and needed guiding here in the ship.  Wade took it into the airlock, and a moment later into space with him. His hand molecular-driving unit pulling him, he towed the machine into place, and with some difficulty got it practically motionless with respect of the two bodies, which were now lying against each other.  "Turn it a bit, Wade, so that the _Ancient Mariner_ is just in its range," came Arcot's thoughts. Wade did so. "Come on back and watch the fun."  Wade returned. Arcot and the others were busy placing a heavy emergency lead from the storeroom in the place of one of the broken leads. In five minutes they had it fixed where they wanted it.  Into the control room went Arcot, and started the power-room teleview plate. Connected into the system of view plates, the scene was visible now on all the plates in the ship. Well off to one side of the room, prepared for such emergencies, and equipped with individual power storage coils that would run it for several days, the view plate functioned smoothly.  "Now, we are ready," said Arcot. The Talsonian proved he understood Arcot's intentions by preceding him to the laboratory.  Arcot had two viewplates operating here. One was covering the scene as shown by the machine outside, and the other showed the power room.  Arcot stepped over to the artificial-matter machine, and worked swiftly on it. In a moment the power from the storage coils of the ship was flowing through the new cable, and into the machine. A huge ring appeared about the nose of the Thessian ship, fitting snugly over it. A terrific wrench--and it was free of the _Ancient Mariner_. The ring contracted and formed a chunk of the stuff free of the broken nose of the ship.  It was carried over to the wall of the _Ancient Mariner_, a smaller piece snipped off as before, and carried inside. A piece of perhaps half a ton mass. "I hope they use good stuff," grinned Arcot. The piece was deposited on the floor of the ship, and a disc formed of artificial matter plugged the hole in its side. Another took a piece of the relux from the broken Thessian ship, pushed it into the hole on the ship. The space about the scene of operation was a crackling inferno of energy breaking down into heat and light. Arcot dematerialized his tremendous tools, and the wall of the _Ancient Mariner_ was neatly patched with relux smoothed over as perfectly as before. A second time, using some of the relux he had brought within the ship, and the inner wall was rebuilt. The job was absolutely perfect, save that now, where there had been lux, there was an outer wall of relux.  The main generator was crumpled up, and torn out. The auxiliary generators would have to carry the load. The great cables were swiftly repaired in the same manner, a perfect cylinder forming about them, and a piece of relux from the store Arcot had sliced from the enemy ship, welding them perfectly under enormous pressure, pressure that made them flow perfectly into one another as heat alone could not.  In less than half an hour the ship was patched up, the power room generally repaired, save for a few minor things that had to be replaced from the stores. The main generator was gone, but that was not an essential. The door was straightened and the job done.  In an hour they were ready to proceed.     Chapter XIV  INTERGALACTIC SPACE   "Well, Sirius has retreated a bit," observed Arcot. The star was indeed several trillions of miles away. Evidently they had not been motionless as they had thought, but the interference of the Thessian ship had thrown their machine off.  "Shall we go back, or go on?" asked Morey.  "The ship works. Why return?" asked Wade. "I vote we go on."  "Seconded," added Arcot.  "If they who know most of the ship vote for a continuance of the journey, then assuredly we who know so little can only abide by their judgment. Let us continue," said Zezdon Afthen gravely.  Space was suddenly black about them. Sirius was gone, all the jewels of the heavens were gone in the black of swift flight. Ten seconds later Arcot lowered the space-control. Black behind them the night of space was pricked by points of light, the infinite multitude of the stars. Before them lay--nothing. The utter emptiness of space between the galaxies.  "Thlek Styrs! What happened?" asked Morey in amazement, his pet Venerian phrase rolling out in his astonishment.  "Tried an experiment, and it was overly successful," replied Arcot, a worried look on his face. "I tried combining the Thessian high speed _time_ distortion with our high _speed_ space distortion--both on low power. 'There ain't no sich animals,' as the old agriculturist remarked of the giraffe. God knows what speed we hit, but it was plenty. We must be ten thousand light years beyond the galaxy."  "That's a fine way to start the trip. You have the old star maps to get back however, have you not?" asked Wade.  "Yes, the maps we made on our first trip out this way are in the cabinet. Look 'em up, will you, and see how far we have to go before we reach the cosmic fields?"  Arcot was busy with his instruments, making a more accurate determination of their distance from the "edge" of the galaxy. He adopted the figure of twelve thousand five hundred light years as the probable best result. Wade was back in a moment with the information that the fields lay about sixteen thousand light years out. Arcot went on, at a rate that would reach the fields in two hours.  Several hours more were spent in measurements, till at last Arcot announced himself satisfied.  "Good enough--back we go." Again in the control room, he threw on the drive, and shot through the twenty-seven thousand light years of cosmic ray fields, and then more leisurely returned to the galaxy. The star maps were strangely off. They could follow them, but only with difficulty as the general configuration of the constellations that were their guides were visibly altered to the naked eye.  "Morey," said Arcot softly, looking at the constellation at which they were then aiming, and at the map before him, "there is something very, very rotten. The Universe either 'ain't what it used to be' or we have traveled in more than space."  "I know it, and I agree with you. Obviously, from the degree of alteration off the constellations, we are off by about 100,000 years. Question: how come? Question: what are we going to do about it?"  "Answer one: remembering what we observed _in re_ Sirius, I suspect that the interference of that Thessian ship, with its time-field opposing our space-field did things to our time-frame. We were probably thrown off then.  "As to the second question, we have to determine number one first. Then we can plan our actions."  With Wade's help, and by coming to rest near several of the stars, then observing their actual motions, they were able to determine their time-status. The estimate they made finally was of the order of eighty thousand years in the past! The Thessian ship had thrown them that much out of their time.  "This isn't all to the bad," said Morey with a sigh. "We at least have all the time we could possibly use to determine the things we want for this fight. We might even do a lot of exploring for the archeologists of Earth and Venus and Ortol and Talso. As to getting back--that's a question."  "Which is," added Arcot, "easy to answer now, thank the good Lord. All we have to do is wait for our time to catch up with us. If we just wait eighty thousand years, eight hundred centuries, we will be in our own time."  "Oh, I think waiting so long would be boring," said Wade sarcastically. "What do you suggest we do in the intervening eighty millenniums? Play cards?"  "Oh, cards or chess. Something like that," grinned Arcot. "Play cards, calculate our fields--and turn on the time rate control."  "Oh--I take it back. You win! Take all! I forgot all about that," Wade smiled at his friend. "That will save a little waiting, won't it."  "The exploring of our worlds would without doubt be of infinite benefit to science, but I wonder if it would not be of more direct benefit if we were to get back to our own time, alive and well. Accidents always happen, and for all our weapons, we might easily meet some animal which would put an abrupt and tragic finish to our explorations. Is it not so?" asked Stel Felso Theu.  "Your point is good, Stel Felso Theu. I agree with you. We will do no more exploring than is necessary, or safe."  "We might just as well travel slowly on the time retarder, and work on the way. I think the thing to do is to go back to Earth, or better, the solar system, and follow the sun in its path."  They returned, and the desolation that the sun in its journey passes through is nothing to the utter, oppressive desolation of empty space between the stars, for it has its family of planets--and it has no conscious thought.  The Sun was far from the point that it had occupied when the travelers had left it, billions on billions of miles further on its journey around the gravitational center of our galactic universe, and in the eighty millenniums that they must wait, it would go far.  They did not go to the planets now, for, as Arcot said in reply to Stel Felso Theu's suggestion that they determine more accurately their position in time, life had not developed to an extent that would enable them to determine the year according to our calendar.  So for thirty thousand years they hung motionless as the sun moved on, and the little spots of light, that were worlds, hurled about it in a mad race. Even Pluto, in its three-hundred-year-long track seemed madly gyrating beneath them; Mercury was a line of light, as it swirled about the swiftly moving sun.  But that thirty thousand years was thirty days to the men of the ship. Their time rate immensely retarded, they worked on their calculations. At the end of that month Arcot had, with the help of Morey and Wade, worked out the last of the formulas of artificial matter, and the machines had turned out the last graphical function of the last branch of research that they could discover. It was a time of labor for them, and they worked almost constantly, stopping occasionally for a game of some sort to relax the nervous tension.  At the end of that month they decided that they would go to Earth.  They speeded their time rate now, and flashed toward Earth at enormous speed that brought them within the atmosphere in minutes. They had landed in the valley of the Nile. Arcot had suggested this as a means of determining the advancement of life of man. Man had evidently established some of his earliest civilizations in this valley where water and sun for his food plants were assured.  "Look--there _are_ men here!" exclaimed Wade. Indeed, below them were villages, of crude huts made of timber and stone and mud. Rubble work walls, for they needed little shelter here, and the people were but savages.  "Shall we land?" asked Arcot, his voice a bit unsteady with suppressed excitement.  "Of course!" replied Morey without turning from his station at the window. Below them now, less than half a mile down on the patchwork of the Nile valley, men were standing, staring up, collecting in little groups, gesticulating toward the strange thing that had materialized in the air above them.  "Does every one agree that we land?" asked Arcot.  There were no dissenting voices, and the ship sank gently toward a road below and to the left. A little knot of watchers broke, and they fled in terror as the great machine approached, crying out to their friends, casting affrighted glances at the huge, shining monster behind them.  Without a jar the mighty weight of the ship touched the soil of its native planet, touched it fifty millenniums before it was made, five hundred centuries before it left!  Arcot's brow furrowed. "There is one thing puzzles me--I can't see how we can come back. Don't you see, Morey, we have disturbed the lives of those people. We have affected history. This must be written into the history that exists.  "This seems to banish the idea of free thought. We have changed history, yet history is that which is already done!  "Had I never been born, had--but I _was_ already--I existed fifty-eighty thousand years before I was born!"  "Let's go out and think about that later. We'll go to a psych hospital, if we don't stop thinking about problems of space and time for a little while. We need some kind of relaxation."  "I suggest that we take our weapons with us. These men may have weapons of chemical nature, such as poisons injected into the flesh on small sticks hurled either by a spring device or by pneumatic pressure of the lungs," said Stel Felso Theu as he rose from his seat unstrapping himself.  "Arrows and blow-guns we call 'em. But it's a good idea, Stel Felso, and I think we will," replied Arcot. "Let's not all go out at once, and the first group to go out goes out on foot, so they won't be scared off by our flying around."  Arcot, Wade, Zezdon Afthen, and Stel Felso Theu went out. The natives had retreated to a respectful distance, and were now standing about, looking on, chattering to themselves. They were edging nearer.  "Growing bold," grinned Wade.  "It is the characteristic of intelligent races manifesting itself--curiosity," pointed out Stel Felso Theu.  "Are these the type of men still living in this valley, or who will be living there in fifty thousand years?" asked Zezdon Afthen.  "I'd say they weren't Egyptians as we know them, but typical Neolithic men. It seems they have brains fully as large as some of the men I see on the streets of New York. I wonder if they have the ability to learn as much as the average man of--say about 1950?"  The Neolithic men were warming up. There was an orator among them, and his grunts, growls, snorts and gestures were evidently affecting them. They had sent the women back (by the simple and direct process of sweeping them up in one arm and heaving them in the general direction of home). The men were brandishing polished stone knives and axes, various instruments of war and peace. One favorite seemed to be a large club.  "Let's forestall trouble," suggested Arcot. He drew his ray pistol, and turned it on the ground directly in front of them, and about halfway between them and the Neoliths. A streak of the soil about two feet wide flashed into intense radiation under the impact of millions on millions of horsepower of radiant energy. Further, it was fused to a depth of twenty feet or more, and intensely hot still deeper. The Neoliths took a single look at it, then turned, and raced for home.  "Didn't like our looks. Let's go back."  They wandered about the world, investigating various peoples, and proved to their own satisfaction that there was no Atlantis, not at this time at any rate. But they were interested in seeing that the polar caps extended much farther toward the equator; they had not retreated at that time to the extent that they had by the opening of history.  They secured some fresh game, an innovation in their larder, and a welcome one. Then the entire ship was swept out with fresh, clean air, their water tanks filled with water from the cold streams of the melting glaciers. The air apparatus was given a new stock to work over.  Their supplies in a large measure restored, thousands of aerial photographic maps made, they returned once more to space to wait.  Their time was taken up for the most part by actual work on the enormous mass of calculation necessary. It is inconceivable to the layman what tremendous labor is involved in the development of a single mathematical hypothesis, and a concrete illustration of it was the long time, with tremendously advanced calculating machines, that was required in their present work.  They had worked out the problem of the time-field, but there they had been aided by the actual apparatus, and the possibilities of making direct tests on machines already set up. The problem of artificial matter, at length fully solved, was a different matter. This had required within a few days of a month (by their clocks; close to thirty thousand years of Earth's time), for they had really been forced to develop it all from the beginning. In the small improvements Arcot had instituted in Stel Felso Theu's device, he had really merely followed the particular branch that Stel Felso Theu had stumbled upon. Hence it was impossible to determine with any great variety, the type of matter created. Now, however, Arcot could make any known kind of matter, and many unknown kinds.  But now came the greatest problem of all. They were ready to start work on the data they had collected in space.  "What," asked Zezdon Afthen, as he watched the three terrestrians begin their work, "is the nature of the thing you are attempting to harness?"  "In a word, energy," replied Arcot, pausing.  "We are attempting to harness energy in its primeval form, in the form of a space-field. Remember, mass is a measure of energy. Two centuries ago a scientist of our world proposed the idea that energy could be measured by mass, and proceeded to prove that the relationship was the now firmly intrenched formula E=Mc^{2}.  "The sun is giving off energy. It is giving off mass, then, in the form of light photons. The field of the sun's gravity must be constantly decreasing as its mass decreases. It is a collapsing field. It is true, the sun's gravitational field does decrease, by a minute amount, despite the fact that our sun loses a thousand million tons of matter every four minutes. The percentage change is minute, but the energy released is--immeasurable.  "But, I am going to invent a new power unit, Afthen. I will call it the 'sol,' the power of a sun. One sol is the rating of our sun. And I will measure the energy I use in terms of sun-powers, not horsepower. That may tell you of its magnitude!"  "But," Zezdon Afthen asked, "while you men of Earth work on this problem, what is there for us? We have no problems, save the problem of the fate of our world, still fifty thousand years of your time in the future. It is terrible to wait, wait, wait and think of what may be happening in that other time. Is there nothing we can do to help? I know our hopeless ignorance of your science. Stel Felso Theu can scarcely understand the thoughts you use, and I can scarcely understand his explanations! I cannot help you there, with your calculations, but is there nothing I can do?"  "There is, Ortolian, decidedly. We badly need your help, and as Stel Felso Theu cannot aid us here as much as he can by working with you, I will ask him to do so. I want your knowledge of psycho-mechanical devices to help us. Will you make a machine controlled by mental impulses? I want to see such a system and know how it is done that I may control machines by such a system."  "Gladly. It will take time, for I am not the expert worker that you are, and I must make many pieces of apparatus, but I will do what I can," exclaimed Zezdon Afthen eagerly.  So, while Arcot and his group continued their work of determining the constants of the space-energy field, the others were working on the mental control apparatus.     Chapter XV  ALL-POWERFUL GODS   Again there was a period of intense labor, while the ship drifted through time, following Earth in its mad careening about the sun, and the sun as it rushed headlong through space. At the end of a thirty-day period, they had reached no definite position in their calculations, and the Talsonian reported, as a medium between the two parties of scientists, that the work of the Ortolian had not reached a level that would make a scientific understanding possible.  As the ship needed no replenishing, they determined to finish their present work before landing, and it was nearly forty thousand years after their first arrival that they again landed on Earth.  It was changed now; the ice caps had retreated visibly, the Nile delta was far longer, far more prominent, and cities showed on the Earth here and there.  Greece, they decided would be the next stop, and to Greece they went, landing on a mountain side. Below was a village, a small village, a small thing of huts and hovels. But the villagers attacked, swarming up the hillside furiously, shouting and shrieking warnings of their terrible prowess to these men who came from the "shining house," ordering them to flee from them and turn over their possession to them.  "What'll we do?" asked Morey. He and Arcot had come out alone this time.  "Take one of these fellows back with us, and question him. We had best get a more or less definite idea of what time-age we are in, hadn't we? We don't want to overshoot by a few centuries, you know!"  The villagers were swarming up the side of the hill, armed with weapons of bronze and wood. The bronze implements of murder were rare, and evidently costly, for those that had them were obviously leaders, and better dressed than the others.  "Hang it all, I have only a molecular pistol. Can't use that, it would be a plain massacre!" exclaimed Arcot.  But suddenly several others, who had come up from one side, appeared from behind a rock. The scientists were wearing their power suits, and had them on at low power, leaving a weight of about fifty pounds. Morey, with his normal weight well over two hundred, jumped far to one side of a clumsy rush of a peasant, leaped back, and caught him from behind. Lifting the smaller man above his head, he hurled him at two others following. The three went down in a heap.  Most of the men were about five feet tall, and rather lightly built. The "Greek God" had not yet materialized among them. They were probably poorly fed, and heavily worked. Only the leaders appeared to be in good physical condition, and the men could not develop to large stature. Arcot and Morey were giants among them, and with their greater skill, tremendous jumping ability, and far greater strength, easily overcame the few who had come by the side. One of the leaders was picked up, and trussed quickly in a rope a fellow had carried.  "Look out," called Wade from above. Suddenly he was standing beside them, having flown down on the power suit. "Caught your thoughts--rather Zezdon Afthen did." He handed Arcot a ray pistol. The rest of the Greeks were near now, crying in amazement, and running more slowly. They didn't seem so anxious to attack. Arcot turned the ray pistol to one side.  "Wait!" called Morey. A face peered from around the rock toward which Arcot had aimed his pistol. It was that of a girl, about fifteen years old in appearance, but hard work had probably aged her face. Morey bent over, heaved on a small boulder, about two hundred pounds of rock, and rolled it free of the depression it rested in, then caught it on a molecular ray, hurled it up. Arcot turned his heat ray on it for an instant, and it was white hot. Then the molecular ray threw it over toward the great rock, and crushed it against it. Three children shrieked and ran out from the rock, scurrying down the hillside.  The soldiers had stopped. They looked at Morey. Then they looked at the great rock, three hundred yards from him. They looked at the rock fragments.  "They think you threw it," grinned Arcot.  "What else--they saw me pick it up, saw me roll it, and it flew. What else could they think?"  Arcot's heat ray hissed out, and the rocks sputtered and cracked, then glowed white. There was a dull explosion, and chips of rock flew up. Water, imprisoned, had been turned into steam. In a moment the whistle and crackle of combined heat and molecular rays stabbing out from Arcot's hands had built a barrier of fused rocks.  Leisurely Arcot and Morey carried their now revived prisoner back to the ship, while Wade flew ahead to open the locks.  Half an hour later the prisoner was discharged, much to his surprise, and the ship rose. They had been able to learn nothing from him. Even the Greek Gods, Zeus, Hermes, Apollo, all the later Greek gods, were unknown, or so greatly changed that Arcot could not recognize them.  "Well," he said at length, "it seems all we know is that they came before any historical Greeks we know of. That puts them back quite a bit, but I don't know how far. Shall we go see the Egyptians?"  They tried Egypt, a few moments across the Mediterranean, landing close to the mouth of the Nile. The people of a village near by immediately set out after them. Better prepared this time, Arcot flew out to meet them with Zezdon Afthen and Stel Felso Theu. Surely, he felt, the sight of the strange men would be no more terrifying than the ship or the men flying. And that did not seem to deter their attack. Apparently the proverb that "Discretion is the better part of valor," had not been invented.  Arcot landed near the head of the column, and cut off two or three men from the rest with the aid of his ray pistol. Zezdon Afthen quickly searched his mind, and with Arcot's aid they determined he did not know any of the Gods that Arcot suggested.  Finally they had to return to the ship, disappointed. They had had the slight satisfaction of finding that the Sun God was Ralz, the later Egyptian Ra might well have been an evolved form of that name.  They restocked the ship, fresh game and fruits again appearing on the menu, then once again they launched forth into space to wait for their own time.  "It seems to me that we must have produced some effect by our visit," said Arcot, shaking his head solemnly.  "We did, Arcot," replied Morey softly. "We left an impress in history, an impress that still is, and an impress that affected countless thousands.  "Meet the Egyptian Gods with their heads strange to terrestrians, the Gods who fly through the air without wings, come from a shining house that flies, whose look, whose pointed finger melts the desert sands, and the moist soil!" he continued softly, nodding toward the Ortolian and the Talsonian.  "Their 'impossible' Gods existed, and visited them. Indubitably some genius saw that here was a chance for fame and fortune and sold 'charms' against the 'Gods.' Result: we are carrying with us some of the oldest deities. Again, we did leave our imprint in history."  "And," cried Wade excitedly, "meet the great Hercules, who threw men about. I always knew that Morey was a brainless brute, but I never realized the marvelous divining powers of those Greeks so perfectly--now, the Incarnation of Dumb Power!" Dramatically Wade pointed to Morey, unable even now to refrain from some unnecessary comments.  "All right, Mercury, the messenger of the Gods speaks. The little flaps on Wade's flying shoes must indeed have looked like the winged shoes of legend. Wade was Mercury, too brainless for anything but carrying the words of wisdom uttered by others.  "And Arcot," continued Morey, releasing Wade from his condescending stare, "is Jove, hurling the rockfusing, destroying thunderbolts!"  "The Gods that my friends have been talking of," explained Arcot to the curious Ortolians, "are legendary deities of Earth. I can see now that we did leave an imprint on history in the only way we could--as Gods, for surely no other explanation could have occurred to those men."  The days passed swiftly in the ship, as their work approached completion. Finally, when the last of the equation of Time, artificial matter, and the most awful of their weapons, the unlimited Cosmic Power, had been calculated, they fell to the last stage of the work. The actual appliances were designed. Then the completed apparatus that the Ortolian and the Talsonian had been working on, was carefully investigated by the terrestrial physicists, and its mechanism studied. Arcot had great plans for this, and now it was incorporated in their control apparatus.  The one remaining problem was their exact location in time. Already their progress had brought them well up to the nineteenth century, but, as Morey sadly remarked, they couldn't tell what date, for they were sadly lacking in history. Had they known the real date, for instance, of the famous battle of Bull Run, they could have watched it in the telectroscope, and so determined their time. As it was, they knew only that it was one of the periods of the first half of the decade of 1860.  "As historians, we're a bunch of first-class kitchen mechanics. Looks like we're due for another landing to locate the exact date," agreed Arcot.  "Why land now? Let's wait until we are nearer the time to which we belong, so we won't have to watch so carefully and so long," suggested Wade.  They argued this question for about two hundred years as a matter of fact. After that, it was academic anyway.     Chapter XVI  HOME AGAIN   They were getting very near their own time, Arcot felt. Indeed, they must already exist on Earth. "One thing that puzzles me," he commented, "is what would happen if we were to go down now, and see ourselves."  "Either we can't or we don't want to do it," pointed out Morey, "because we didn't."  "I think the answer is that nothing can exist two times at the same time-rate," said Arcot. "As long as we were in a different time-rate we could exist at two times. When we tried to exist simultaneously, we could not, and we were forced to slip through time to a time wherein we either did not exist or wherein we had not yet been. Since we were nearer the time when we last existed in normal time, than we were to the time of our birth, we went to the time we left. I suspect that we will find we have just left Earth. Shall we investigate?"  "Absolutely, Arcot, and here's hoping we didn't overshoot the mark by much." As Morey intimated, had they gone much beyond the time they left Earth, they might find conditions very serious, indeed. But now they went at once toward Earth on the time control. As they neared, they looked anxiously for signs of the invasion. Arcot spotted the only evident signs, however; two large spheres, tiny points in appearance on the telectroscope screen, were circling Earth, one at about 1,000 miles, moving from east to west, the other about 1,200 miles moving from north to south.  "It seems the enemy have retreated to space to do their fighting. I wonder how long we were away."  As they swept down at a speed greater than light, they were invisible till Arcot slowed down near the atmosphere. Instantly half a dozen fast ships darted toward them, but the ship was very evidently unlike the Thessian ships, and no attack was made. First the occupants would have an opportunity to prove their friendliness.  "Terrestrians Arcot, Morey and Wade reporting back from exploration in space, with two friends. All have been on Earth with us previously," said Arcot into the radio vision apparatus.  "Very well, Dr. Arcot. You are going to New York or Vermont?" asked the Patrol commander.  "Vermont."  "Yes, Sir. I'll see that you aren't stopped again."  And, thanks to the message thus sent ahead, they were not, and in less than half an hour they landed once more in Vermont, on the field from which they had started.  The group of scientists who had been here on their last call had gone, which seemed natural enough to them, who had been working for three months in the interval of their trip, but to Dr. Arcot senior, as he saw them, it was a misfortune.  "Now I never will get straight all you'll have ready, and I didn't expect you back till next week. The men have all gone back to their laboratories, since that permits of better work on the part of each, but we can call them here in half an hour. I'm sure they'll want to come. What did you learn, Son, or haven't you done any calculating on your data as yet?"  "We learned plenty, and I feel quite sure that a hint of what we have would bring all those learning-hounds around us pretty quickly, Dad," laughed Arcot junior, "and believe it or not, we've been calculating on this stuff for three months since we left yesterday!"  "What!"  "Yes, it's true! We were on our time field, and turned on the space control--and a Thessian ship picked that moment to run into us. We cut the ship in half as neatly as you please, but it threw us eighty thousand years into the past. We have been coasting through time on retarded rate while Earth caught up with itself, so to speak. In the meantime--three months in a day!  "But don't call those men. Let them come to the appointment, while we do some work, and we have plenty of work to do, I assure you. We have a list of things to order from the standard supply houses, and I think you better get them for us, Dad." Arcot's manner became serious now. "We haven't gotten our Government Expense Research Cards yet, and you have. Order the stuff, and get it out here, while we get ready for it. Honestly, I believe that a few ships such as this apparatus will permit, will be enough in themselves to do the job. It really is a pity that the other men didn't have the opportunity we had for crowding much work into little time!  "But then, I wouldn't want to take that road to concentration again myself!  "Have the enemy amused you in my absence? Come on, let's sit down in the house instead of standing here in the sun."  They started toward the house, as Arcot senior explained what had happened in the short time they had been away.  "There is a friend of yours here, whom you haven't seen in some time, Son. He came with some allies."  As they entered the house, they could hear the boards creak under some heavy weight that moved across the floor, soundlessly and light of motion in itself. A shadow fell across the hall floor, and in the doorway a tremendously powerfully-built figure stood.  He seemed to overflow the doorway, nearly six and a half feet tall, and fully as wide as the door. His rugged, bronzed face was smiling pleasantly, and his deep-set eyes seemed to flash; a living force flowed from them.  "Torlos! By the Nine Planets! Torlos of Nansal! Say, I didn't expect you here, and I will not put my hand in that meatgrinder of yours," grinned Arcot happily, as Torlos stretched forth a friendly, but quite too powerful hand.  Torlos of Nansal, that planet Arcot had discovered on his first voyage across space, far in another Island of Space, another Island Universe, was not constructed as are human beings of Earth, nor of Venus, Talso, or Ortol, but most nearly resembled, save in size, the Thessians. Their framework, instead of being stone, as is ours, was iron, their bones were pure metallic iron, far stronger than bone. On these far stronger bones were great muscles of an entirely different sort, a muscle that used heat of the body as its fuel, a muscle that was utterly tireless, and unbelievably powerful. Not a chemical engine, but a molecular motion engine, it had no chemical fatigue-products that would tire it, and needed only the constant heat supply the body sucked from the air to work indefinitely. Unlimited by waste-carrying considerations, the strength was enormous.  It was one of the commercial space freighters plying between Nansal, Sator, Earth and Venus that had brought the news of this war to him, Torlos explained, and he, as the new Trade Coordinator and Fourth of the Four who now ruled Nansal, had suggested that they go to the aid of the man who had so aided them in their great war with Sator. It was Arcot's gift of the secret of the molecular ray and the molecular ship that had enabled them to overcome their enemy of centuries, and force upon them an unwelcome peace.  Now, with a fleet of fifty interstellar, or better, intergalactic battleships, Nansal was coming to Earth's aid.  The battleships were now on patrol with all of Earth's and Venus' fleet. But the Nansalian ships were all equipped with the enormously rapid space distortion system of travel, of course, and were a shock troop in the patrol. The Terrestrian and Venerian patrols were not so equipped in full.  "And Arcot, from what I have learned from your father, it seems that I can be of real assistance," finished Torlos.  "But now, I think, I should know what the enemy has done. I see they built some forts."  "Yes," replied Arcot senior, "they did. They decided that the system used on the forts of North and South poles was too effective. They moved to space, and cut off slices of Luna, pulled it over on their molecular rays, and used some of the most magnificent apparatus you ever dreamed of. I have just started working on the mathematics of it.  "We sent out a fleet to do some investigating, but they attacked, and stopped work in the meantime. Whatever the ray is that can destroy matter at a distance, they are afraid that we could find its secret too easily, and block it, for they don't think it is a weapon, and it is evidently slow in action."  "Then it isn't what I thought it was," muttered Arcot.  "What did you think it was?" asked his father.  "Er--tell you later. Go on with the account."  "Well, to continue. We have not been idle. Following your suggestion, we built up a large ray screen apparatus, in fact, several of them, and carried them in ships to different parts of the world. Also some of the planets, lest they start dropping worlds on us. They are already in operation, sending their defensive waves against the Heaviside layer. Radio is poor, over any distance, and we can't call Venus from inside the layer now. However, we tested the protection, and it works--far more efficiently than we calculated, due to the amazing conductivity of the layer.  "If they intend to attack in that way, I suspect that it will be soon, for they are ready now, as we discovered. An attack on their fort was met with a ray screen from the fort.  "They fight with a wild viciousness now. They won't let a ship get near them. They destroy everything on sight. They seem tremendously afraid of that apparatus of yours. Too bad we had no more."  "We will have--if you will let me get to work."  They went to the ship, and entered it. Arcot senior did not follow, but the others waited, while the ship left Earth once more, and floated in space. Immediately they went into the time-field.  They worked steadily, sleeping when necessary, and the giant strength of Torlos was frequently as great an asset as his indefatigable work. He was learning rapidly, and was able to do a great deal of the work without direction. He was not a scientist, and the thing was new to him, but his position as one of the best of the secret intelligence force of Nansal had proven his brains, and he did his share.  The others, scientists all, found the operations difficult, for work had been allotted to each according to his utmost capabilities.  It was still nearly a week of their time before the apparatus was completed to the extent possible, less than a minute of normal time passing.  Finally the unassembled, but completed apparatus, was carried to the laboratory of the cottage, and word was sent to all the men of Earth that Arcot was going to give a demonstration of the apparatus he hoped would save them. The scientists from all over Earth and Venus were interested, and those of Earth came, for there was no time for the men of Venus to arrive to inspect the results.     Chapter XVII  POWER OF MIND   It was night. The stars visible through the laboratory windows winked violently in the disturbed air of the Heaviside layer, for the molecular ray screen was still up.  The laboratory was dimly lighted now, all save the front of the room. There, a mass of compact boxes were piled one on another, and interconnected in various and indeterminate ways. And one table lay in a brilliant path of illumination. Behind it stood Arcot. He was talking to the dim white group of faces beyond the table, the scientists of Earth assembled.  "I have explained our power. It is the power of all the universe--Cosmic Power--which is necessarily vaster than all others combined.  "I cannot explain the control in the time I have at my disposal but the mathematics of it, worked out in two months of constant effort, you can follow from the printed work which will appear soon.  "The second thing, which some of you have seen before, has already been partly explained. It is, in brief, artificially created matter. The two important things to remember about it are that it _is_, that it _does exist_, and that it exists _only where it is determined to exist by the control there, and nowhere else_.  "These are all coordinated under the new mental relay control. Some of you will doubt this last, but think of it under this light. Will, thought, concentration--they are efforts, they require energy. Then they can exert energy! That is the key to the whole thing.  "But now for the demonstration."  Arcot looked toward Morey, who stood off to one side. There was a heavy thud as Morey pushed a small button. The relay had closed. Arcot's mind was now connected with the controls.  A globe of cloudiness appeared. It increased in density, and was a solid, opalescent sphere.  "There is a sphere, a foot in diameter, ten feet from me," droned Arcot. The sphere was there. "It is moving to the left." The sphere moved to the left at Arcot's thought. "It is rising." The sphere rose. "It is changing to a disc two feet across." The sphere seemed to flow, and was a disc two feet across as Arcot's toneless voice of concentration continued.  "It is changing into a hand, like a human hand." The disc changed into a human hand, the fingers slightly bent, the soft, white fingers of a woman with the pink of the flesh and the wrinkles at the knuckles visible. The wrist seemed to fade gradually into nothingness, the end of the hand was as indeterminate as are things in a dream, but the hand was definite.  "The hand is reaching for the bar of lux metal on the floor." The soft, little hand moved, and reached down and grasped the half ton bar of lux metal, wrapped dainty fingers about it and lifted it smoothly and effortlessly to the table, and laid it there.  A mistiness suddenly solidified to another hand. The second hand joined the first, and fell to work on the bar, and pulled. The bar stretched finally under an enormous load. One hand let go, and the thud of the highly elastic lux metal bar's return to its original shape echoed through the soundless room. These men of the twenty-second century knew what relux and lux metals were, and knew their enormous strength. Yet it was putty under these hands. The hands that looked like a woman's!  The bar was again placed on the table, and the hands disappeared. There was a thud, and the relay had opened.  "I can't demonstrate the power I have. It is impossible. The power is so enormous that nothing short of a sun could serve as a demonstration-hall. It is utterly beyond comprehension under any conditions. I have demonstrated artificial matter, and control by mental action.  "I'm now going to show you some other things we have learned. Remember, I can control perfectly the properties of artificial matter, by determining the structure it shall have.  "Watch."  Morey closed the relay. Arcot again set to work. A heavy ingot of iron was raised by a clamp that fastened itself upon it, coming from nowhere. The iron moved, and settled over the table. As it approached, a mistiness that formed became a crucible. The crucible showed the gray of pure iron, but it was artificial matter. The iron settled in the crucible, and a strange process of flowing began. The crucible became a ball, and colors flowed across its surface, till finally it was glowing richly silvery. The ball opened, and a great lump of silvery stuff was within it. It settled to the floor, and the ball disappeared, but the silvery metal did not.  "Platinum," said Morey softly. A gasp came from the audience. "Only platinum could exist there, and the matter had to rearrange itself as platinum." He could rearrange it in any form he chose, either absorbing or supplying energy of existence and energy of formation.  The mistiness again appeared in the air, and became a globe, a globe of brown. But it changed, and disappeared. Morey recognized the signal. "He will now make the artificial matter into all the elements, and many nonexistent elements, unstable, atomic figures." There followed a long series of changes.  The material shifted again, and again. Finally the last of the natural elements was left behind, all 104 elements known to man were shown, and many others.  "We will skip now. This is element of atomic weight 7000."  It was a lump of soft, oozy blackness. One could tell from the way that Arcot's mind handled it that it was soft. It seemed cold, terribly cold. Morey explained:  "It is very soft, for its atom is so large that it is soft in the molecular state. It is tremendously photoe-lectric, losing electrons very readily, and since its atom has so enormous a volume, its electrons are very far from the nucleus in the outer rings, and they absorb rays of very great length; even radio and some shorter audio waves seem to affect it. That accounts for its blackness, and the softness as Arcot has truly depicted it. Also, since it absorbs heat waves and changes them to electrical charges, it tends to become cold, as the frost Arcot has shown indicates. Remember, that that is infinitely hard as you see it, for it is artificial matter, but Arcot has seen natural matter forced into this exceedingly explosive atomic figuration.  "It is so heavily charged in the nucleus that its X-ray spectrum is well toward the gamma! The inner electrons can scarcely vibrate."  Again the substance changed--and was gone.  "Too far--atom of weight 20,000 becomes invisible and nonexistent as space closes in about it--perhaps the origin of our space. Atoms of this weight, if breaking up, would form two or more atoms that would exist in our space, then these would be unstable, and break down further into normal atoms. We don't know.  "And one more substance," continued Morey as he opened the relay once more. Arcot sat down and rested his head in his hands. He was not accustomed to this strain, and though his mind was one of the most powerful on Earth, it was very hard for him.  "We have a substance of commercial and practical use now. Cosmium. Arcot will show one method of making it."  Arcot resumed his work, seated now. A formation reached out, and grasped the lump of platinum still on the floor. Other bars of iron were brought over from the stack of material laid ready, and piled on a broad sheet that had formed in the air, tons of it, tens of tons. Finally he stopped. There was enough. The sheet wrapped itself into a sphere, and contracted, slowly, steadily. It was rampant with energy, energy flowed from it, and the air about was glowing with ionization. There was a feeling of awful power that seeped into the minds of the watchers, and held them spellbound before the glowing, opalescent sphere. The tons of matter were compressed now to a tiny ball! Suddenly the energy flared out violently, a terrific burst of energy, ionizing the air in the entire room, and shooting it with tiny, burning sparks. Then it was over. The ball split, and became two planes. Between them was a small ball of a glistening solid. The planes moved slowly together, and the ball flattened, and flowed. It was a sheet.  A clamp of artificial matter took it, and held the paper-thin sheet, many feet square, in the air. It seemed it must bend under its own enormous weight of tons, but thin as it was it did not.  "Cosmium," said Morey softly.  Arcot crumpled it, and pressed it once more between artificial matter tools. It was a plate, thick as heavy cardboard, and two feet on a side. He set it in a holder of artificial matter, a sort of frame, and caused the controls to lock.  Taking off the headpiece he had worn, he explained, "As Morey said, Cosmium. Briefly, density, 5007.89. Tensile strength, about two hundred thousand times that of good steel!" The audience gasped. That seems little to men who do not realize what it meant. An inch of this stuff would be harder to penetrate than three miles of steel!  "Our new ship," continued Arcot, "will carry six-inch armor. Six inches would be the equivalent of eighteen miles of solid steel, with the enormous improvement that it will be concentrated, and so will have far greater resistance than any amount of steel. Its tensile strength would be the equivalent of an eighteen-mile wall of steel.  "But its most important properties are that it reflects everything we know of. Cosmics, light, and even moleculars! It is made of cosmic ray photons, as lux is made of light photons, but the inexpressibly tighter bond makes the strength enormous. It cannot be handled by any means save by artificial matter tools.  "And now I am going to give a demonstration of the theatrical possibilities of this new agent. Hardly scientific--but amusing."  But it wasn't exactly amusing.  Arcot again donned the headpiece. "I think," he continued, "that a manifestation of the super-natural will be most interesting. Remember that all you see is real, and all effects are produced by artificial matter generated by the cosmic energy, as I have explained, and are controlled by my mind."  Arcot had chosen to give this demonstration with definite reason. Apparently a bit of scientific playfulness, yet he knew that nothing is so impressive, nor so lastingly remembered as a theatrical demonstration of science. The greatest scientist likes to play with his science.  But Arcot's experiment now--it was on a level of its own!  From behind the table, apparently crawling up the leg came a thing! It was a hand. A horrible, disjointed hand. It was withered and incarmined with blood, for it was severed from its wrist, and as it hunched itself along, moving by a ghastly twitching of fingers and thumb, it left a trail of red behind it. The papers to be distributed rustled as it passed, scurrying suddenly across the table, down the leg, and racing toward the light switch! By some process of writhing jerks it reached it, and suddenly the room was plunged into half-light as the lights winked out. Light filtering over the transom of the door from the hall alone illuminated the hall, but the hand glowed! It glowed, and scurried away with an awful rustling, scuttling into some unseen hole in the wall. The quiet of the hall was the quiet of tenseness.  From the wall, coming through it, came a mistiness that solidified as it flowed across. It was far to the right, a bent stooped figure, a figure half glimpsed, but fully known, for it carried in its bony, glowing hand a great, nicked scythe. Its rattling tread echoed hollowly on the floor. Stooping walk, shuffling gait, the great metal scythe scraping on the floor, half seen as the gray, luminous cloak blew open in some unfelt breeze of its ephemeral world, revealing bone; dry, gray bone. Only the scythe seemed to know Life, and it was red with that Life. Slow running, sticky lifestuff.  Death paused, and raised his awful head. The hood fell back from the cavernous eyesockets, and they flamed with a greenish radiance that made every strained face in the room assume the same deathly pallor.  "The Scythe, the Scythe of Death," grated the rusty Voice. "The Scythe is slow, too slow. I bring new things," it cackled in its cracked voice, "new things of my tools. See!" The clutching bones dropped the rattling Scythe, and the handle broke as it fell, and rotted before their eyes. "Heh, heh," the Thing cackled as it watched. "Heh--what Death touches, rots as he leaves it." The grinning, blackened skull grinned wider, in an awful, leering cavity, rotting, twisted teeth showed. But from under his flapping robe, the skeletal hands drew something--ray pistols!  "These--these are swifter!" The Thing turned, and with a single leering glance behind, flowed once more through the wall.  A gasp, a stifled, groaning gasp ran through the hall, a half sob.  But far, far away they could hear something clanking, dragging its slow way along. Spellbound they turned to the farthest corner--and looked down the long, long road that twined off in distance. A lone, luminous figure plodded slowly along it, his half human shamble bringing him rapidly nearer.  Larger and larger he loomed, clearer and clearer became the figure, and his burden. Broken, twisted steel, or metal of some sort, twisted and blackened.  "It's over--it's over--and my toys are here. I win, I always win. For I am the spawn of Mars, of War, and of Hate, the sister of War, and my toys are the things they leave behind." It gesticulated, waving the twisted stuff and now through the haze, they could see them--buildings. The framework of buildings and twisted liners, broken weapons.  It loomed nearer, the cavernous, glowing eyes under low, shaggy brows, became clear, the awful brutal hate, the lust of Death, the rotting flesh of Disease--all seemed stamped on the Horror that approached.  "Ah!" It had seen them! "Ahh!" It dropped the buildings, the broken things, and shuffled into a run, toward them! Its face changed, the lips drew back from broken, stained teeth, the curling, cruel lips, and the rotting flesh of the face wrinkled into a grin of lust and hatred. The shaggy mop of its hair seemed to writhe and twist, the long, thin fingers grasped spasmodically as it neared. The torn, broken fingernails were visible--nearer--nearer--nearer--  "Oh, God--stop it!" A voice shrieked out of the dark as someone leaped suddenly to his feet.  Simultaneously with the cry the Thing puffed into nothingness of energy from which it had sprung, and a great ball of clear, white glowing light came into being in the center of the room, flooding it with a light that dazzled the eyes, but calmed broken nerves.     Chapter XVIII  EARTH'S DEFENSES   "I am sorry, Arcot. I did not know, for I see I might have helped, but to me, with my ideas of horror, it was as you said, amusement," said Torlos. They were sitting now in Arcot's study at the cottage; Arcot, his father, Morey, Wade, Torlos, the three Ortolians and the Talsonian.  "I know, Torlos. You see, where I made my mistake, as I have said, was in forgetting that in doing as I did, picturing horror, like a snowball rolling, it would grow greater. The idea of horror, started, my mind pictured one, and it inspired greater horror, which in turn reacted on my all too reactive apparatus. As you said, the things changed as you watched, molding themselves constantly as my mind changed them, under its own initiative and the concentrated thoughts of all those others. It was a very foolish thing to do, for that last Thing--well, remember it _was_, it existed, and the idea of hate and lust it portrayed was caused by my mind, but my mind could picture what it would do, if such were its emotions, and it would do them because my mind pictured them! And _nothing_ could resist it!" Arcot's face was white once more as he thought of the danger he had run, of the terrible consequences possible of that 'amusement.'  "I think we had best start on the ship. I'll go get some sleep now, and then we can go."  Arcot led the way to the ship, while Torlos, Morey and Wade and Stel Felso Theu accompanied him. The Ortolians were to work on Earth, aiding in the detection of attacks by means of their mental investigation of the enemy.  "Well--good-bye, Dad. Don't know when I'll be back. Maybe twenty-five thousand years from now, or twenty-five thousand years ago. But we'll get back somehow. And we'll clean out the Thessians!"  He entered the ship, and rose into space.  "Where are you going, Arcot?" asked Morey.  "Eros," replied Arcot laconically.  "Not if my mind is working right," cried Wade suddenly. All the others were tense, listening for inaudible sounds.  "I quite agree," replied Arcot. The ship turned about, and dived toward New York, a hundred thousand miles behind now, at a speed many times that of light as Arcot snapped into time. Across the void, Zezdon Fentes' call had come--New York was to be attacked by the Thessians, New York and Chicago next. New York because the orbits of their two forts were converging over that city in a few minutes!  They were in the atmosphere, screaming through it as their relux glowed instantaneously in the Heaviside layer, then was through before damage could be done. The screen was up.  Scarcely a minute after they passed, the entire heavens blazed into light, the roar of tremendous thunders crashing above them, great lightning bolts rent the upper air for miles as enormous energies clashed.  "Ah--they are sending everything they have against that screen, and it's hot. We have ten of our biggest tube stations working on it, and more coming in, to our total of thirty, but they have two forts, and Lord knows how many ships.  "I think me I'm going to cause them some worrying."  Arcot turned the ship, and drove up again, now at a speed very low to them but as they had the time-field up, very great. They passed the screen, and a tremendous bolt struck the ship. Everything in it was shielded, but the static was still great enough to cause them some trouble as the time-field and electric field fought. But the time-field, because of its very nature, could work faster, and they won through undamaged, though the enormous current seemed flowing for many minutes as they drifted slowly past it. Slowly--at fifty miles a second.  Out in space, free of the atmosphere, Arcot shot out to the point where the Thessians were congregating. The shining dots of their ships and the discs of the forts were visible from Earth save for the air's distortion.  They seemed a miniature Milky Way, their deadly beams concentrated on Earth.  Then the Thessians discovered that the terrestrial fleet was in action. A ship glowed with the ray, the opalescence of relux under moleculars visible on its walls. It simply searched for its opponent while its relux slowly yielded. It found it in time, and the terrestrial ship put up its screen.  The terrestrial fleet set to work, everything they had flying at the Thessian giants, but the Thessians had heavier ships, and heavier tubes. More power was winning for them. Inevitably, when the Sun's interference somewhat weakened the ray shield--  About that time Arcot arrived. The nearest fort dived toward the further with an acceleration that smashed it against no less than ten of its own ships before they could so much as move.  When the way was clear to the other fort--and that fort had moved, the berserk fort started off a new tack--and garnered six more wrecks on its side.  Then Thett's emissaries located Arcot. The screen was up, and the Negrian attractive ray apparatus which Arcot had used was working through it. The screen flashed here and there and collapsed under the full barrage of half the Thessian fleet, as Arcot had suspected it would. But the same force that made it collapse operated a relay that turned on the space control, and Thett's molecular ray energy steamed off to outer space.  "We worried them, then dug our hole and dragged it in after us, as usual, but damn it, we can't hurt them!" said Arcot disgustedly. "All we can do is tease them, then go hide where it's perfectly safe, in artificial--" Arcot stopped in amazement. The ship had been held under such space control that space was shut in about them, and they were motionless. The dials had reached a steady point, the current flow had become zero, and they hung there with only the very slow drain of the Sun's gravitational field and that of the planet's field pulling on the ship. Suddenly the current had leaped, and the dials giving the charge in the various coil banks had moved them down toward zero.  "Hey--they've got a wedge in here and are breaking out our hole. Turn on all the generators, Morey." Arcot was all action now. Somehow, inconceivable though it was, the Thessians had spotted them, and got some means of attacking them, despite their invulnerable position in another space!  The generators were on, pouring enormous power into the coils, and the dials surged, stopped, and climbed ever so slowly. They should have jumped back under that charge, ordinarily dangerously heavy. For perhaps thirty seconds they climbed, then they started down at full speed!  Arcot's hand darted to the time field, and switched it on full. The dial jerked, swung, then swung back, and started falling in unison with the dials, stopped, and climbed. All climbed swiftly, gaining ever more rapidly. With what seemed a jerk, the time dial flew over, and back, as Arcot opened the switch. They were free, and the dial on the space control coils was climbing normally now.  "By the Nine Planets, did they drink out our energy! The energy of six tons of lead just like that!"  "How'd they do it?" asked Wade.  Torlos kept silent, and helped Morey replace the coils of lead wire with others from stock.  "Same way we tickled them," replied Arcot, carefully studying the control instruments, "with the gravity ray! We knew all along that gravitational fields drank out the energy--they simply pulled it out faster than we could pump it in, and used four different rays on us doing it. Which speaks well for a little ship! But they burned off the relux on one room here, and it's a wreck. The molecs hit everything in it. Looks like something bad," called Arcot. The room was Morey's, but he'd find that out himself. "In the meantime, see if you can tell where we are. I got loose from their rays by going on both the high speed time-field and the space control at full, with all generators going full blast. Man, they had a stranglehold on us that time! But wait till we get that new ship turned out!"  With the telectroscope they could see what was happening. The terrific bombardment of rays was continuing, and the fleets were locked now in a struggle, the combined fleets of Earth and Venus and of Nansal, far across the void. Many of the terrestrian, or better, Solarian ships, were equipped with space distortion apparatus, now, and had some measure of safety in that the attractive rays of the Thessians could not be so concentrated on them. In numbers was safety; Arcot had been endangered because he was practically alone at the time they attacked.  But it was obvious that the Solarian fleet was losing. They could not compete with the heavier ships, and now the frequent flaming bursts of light that told of a ship caught in the new deadly ray showed another danger.  "I think Earth is lost if you cannot aid it soon, Arcot, for other Thessian ships are coming," said Stel Felso Theu softly.  From out of the plane of the planetary orbits they were coming, across space from some other world, a fleet of dozens of them. They were visible as one after another leapt into normal time-rates.  "Why don't they fight in advanced time?" asked Morey, half aloud.  "Because the genius that designed that apparatus didn't think of it. Remember, Morey, those ships have their time apparatus connected with their power apparatus so that the power has to feed the time continuously. They have no coils like ours. When they advance their time, they're weakened every other way.  "We need that new ship. Are we going to make it?" demanded Arcot.  "Take weeks at best. What chance?" asked Morey.  "Plenty; watch." As he spoke, Arcot pulled open the time controls, and spun the ship about. They headed off toward a tiny point of light far beyond. It rushed toward them, grew with the swiftness of an exploding bomb, and was suddenly a great, rough fragment of a planet hanging before them, miles in extent.  "Eros," explained Wade laconically to Torlos. "Part of an ancient planet that was destroyed before the time of man, or life on Earth. The planet got too near the sun when its orbit was irregular, and old Sol pulled it to pieces. This is one of the pieces. The other asteroids are the rest. All planetary surfaces are made up of great blocks; they aren't continuous, you know. Like blocks of concrete in a building, they can slide a bit on each other, but friction holds them till they slip with a jar and we have earthquakes. This is one of the planetary blocks. We see Eros from Earth intermittently, for when this thing turns broadside it reflects a lot of light; edge on it does not reflect so much."  It was a desolate bit of rock. Bare, airless, waterless rock, of enormous extent. It was contorted and twisted, but there were no great cracks in it for it was a single planetary block.  Arcot dropped the ship to the barren surface, and anchored it with an attractive ray at low concentration. There was no gravity of consequence on this bit of rock.  "Come on, get to work. Space suits, and rush all the apparatus out," snapped Arcot. He was on his feet, the power of the ship in neutral now. Only the attractor was on. In the shortest possible time they got into their suits, and under Arcot's direction set up the apparatus on the rocky soil as fast as it was brought out. In all, less than fifteen minutes were needed, yet Arcot was hurrying them more and more. Torlos' tremendous strength helped, even on this gravitationless world, for he could accelerate more quickly with his burdens.  At last it was up for operation. The artificial matter apparatus was operated by cosmic power, and controlled by mental operation, or by mathematical formula as they pleased. Immediately Arcot set to work. A giant hollow cylinder drilled a great hole completely through the thin, curved surface of the ancient planetary block, through twelve miles of solid rock--a cylinder of artificial matter created on a scale possible only to cosmic power. The cylinder, half a mile across, contained a huge plug of matter. Then the artificial matter contracted swiftly, compressing the matter, and simultaneously treating it with the tremendous fields that changed its energy form. In seconds it was a tremendous mass of cosmium.  A second smaller cylinder bored a plug from the rock, and worked on it. A huge mass of relux resulted. Now other artificial matter tools set to work at Arcot's bidding, and cut pieces from his huge masses of raw materials, and literally, quick as thought, built a great framework of them, anchored in the solid rock of the planetoid.  Then a tremendous plane of matter formed, and neatly bisected the planetoid, two great flat pieces of rock were left where one had been--miles across, miles thick--planetary chips.  On the great framework that had been constructed, four tall shafts of cosmium appeared, and each was a hollow tube, up the center of which ran a huge cable of relux. At the peak of each mile-high shaft was a great globe. Now in the framework below things were materializing as Arcot's flying thoughts arranged them--great tubes of cosmium with relux element--huge coils of relux conductors, insulated with microscopic but impenetrable layers of cosmium.  Still, for all his swiftness of mind and accuracy of thought, he had to correct two mistakes in all his work. It was nearly an hour before the thing was finished. Then, two hundred feet long, a hundred wide, and fifty in height, the great mechanism was completed, the tall columns rising from four corners of the greater framework that supported it.  Then, into it, Arcot turned the powers of the cosmos. The stars in the airless space wavered and danced as though seen through a thick atmosphere. Tingling power ran through them as it flowed into the tremendous coils. For thirty seconds--then the heavens were as before.  At last Arcot spoke. Through the radio communicators, and through the thought-channels, his ideas came as he took off the headpiece. "It's done now, and we can rest." There was a tremendous crash from within the apparatus. The heavens reeled before them, and shifted, then were still, but the stars were changed. The sun shone weirdly, and the stars were altered.  "That is a time shifting apparatus on a slightly larger scale," replied Arcot to Torlos' question, "and is designed to give us a chance to work. Come on, let's sleep. A week here should be a few minutes of Earthtime."  "You sleep, Arcot. I'll prepare the materials for you," suggested Morey. So Arcot and Wade went to sleep, while Morey and the Talsonian and Torlos worked. First Morey bound the _Ancient Mariner_ to the frame of the time apparatus, safely away from the four luminous balls, broadcasters of the time field. Then he shut off the attractive ray, and bound himself in the operator's seat of the apparatus of the artificial matter machine.  A plane of artificial matter formed, and a stretch of rock rose under its lift as it cleft the rock apart. A great cleared, level space resulted. Other artificial matter enclosed the rock, and the fragments cut free were treated under tremendous pressure. In a few moments a second enormous mass of cosmium was formed.  For three hours Morey worked steadily, building a tremendous reserve of materials. Lux metal he did not make, but relux, the infusible, perfect conductor, and cosmium in tremendous masses, he did make. And he made some great blocks of oxygen from the rock, transmuting the atoms, and stored it frozen on the plane, with liquid hydrogen in huge tanks, and some metals that would be needed. Then he slept while they waited for Arcot.  Eight hours after he had lain down, Arcot was up, and ate his breakfast. He set to work at once with the machine. It didn't suit him, it seemed, and first he made a new tool, a small ship that could move about, propelled by a piece of artificial matter, and the entire ship was a tremendously greater artificial matter machine, with a greater power than before!  His thoughts, far faster than hands could move, built up the gigantic hull of the new ship, and put in the rooms, and the brace members in less than twelve hours. A titanic shell of eight-inch cosmium, a space, with braces of the same nonconductor of heat, cosmium, and a two inch inner hull. A tiny space in the gigantic hull, a space less than one thousand cubic feet in dimension was the control and living quarters.  It was held now on great cosmium springs, but Arcot was not by any means through. One man must do all the work, for one brain must design it, and though he received the constant advice and help of Morey and the others, it was his brain that pictured the thing that was built.  At last the hull was completed. A single, glistening tube, of enormous bulk, a mile in length, a thousand feet in diameter. Yet nearly all of that great bulk would be used immediately. Some room would be left for additional apparatus they might care to install. Spare parts they did not have to carry--they could make their own from the energy abounding in space.  The enormous, shining hull was a thing of beauty through stark grandeur now, but obviously incomplete. The ray projectors were not mounted, but they were to be ray projectors of a type never before possible. Space is the transmitter of all rays, and it is in space that those energy forms exist. Arcot had merely to transfer the enormously high energy level of the space-curvature to any form of energy he wanted, and now, with the complete statistics on it, he was able to do that directly. No tubes, no generators, only fields that changed the energy already there--the immeasurable energy available!  The next period of work he started the space distortion apparatus. That must go at the exact center of the ship. One tremendous coil, big enough for the _Ancient Mariner_ to lie in easily! Minutes, and flying thoughts had made it--then came thousands of the individual coils, by thinking of one, and picturing it many times! In ranks, rows, and columns they were piled into a great block, for power must be stored for use of this tremendous machine, while in the artificial space when its normal power was not available, and that power source must be tremendous.  Then the time apparatus, and after that the driving apparatus. Not the molecular drive now, but an attraction ray focused on their own ship, with projectors scattered about the ship that it might move effortlessly in every direction. And provision was made for a force-drive by means of artificial matter, planes of it pushing the ship where it was wanted. But with the attraction-drive they would be able to land safely, without fear of being crushed by their own weight on Thett, for all its enormous gravity.  The control was now suspended finally, with a series of attraction drives about it, locking it immovably in place, while smaller attraction devices stimulated gravity for the occupants.  Then finally the main apparatus--the power plant--was installed. The enormous coils which handled, or better, caused space to handle as they directed, powers so great that whole suns could be blasted instantaneously, were put in place, and the field generators that would make and direct their rays, their ray screen if need be, and handle their artificial matter. Everything was installed, and all but a rather small space was occupied.  It had been six weeks of continuous work for them, for the mind of each was aiding in this work, indirectly or directly, and it neared completion now.  "But, we need one more thing, Arcot. That could never land on any planet smaller than Jupiter. What is its mass?" suggested Morey.  "Don't know, I'm sure, but it is of the order of a billion tons. I know you are right. What are we going to do?"  "Put on a tender."  "Why not the _Ancient Mariner_?" asked Wade.  "It isn't fitting. It was designed for individual use anyway," replied Morey. "I suggest something more like this on a small scale. We won't have much work on that, merely think of every detail of the big ship on a small scale, with the exception of the control cube furnishings. Instead of the numerous decks, swimming pool and so forth, have a large, single room."  "Good enough," replied Arcot.  As if by magic, a machine appeared, a "small" machine of two-hundred-foot length, modified slightly in some parts, its bottom flattened, and equipped with an attractor anchor. Then they were ready.  "We will leave the _Mariner_ here, and get it later. This apparatus won't be needed any longer, and we don't want the enemy to get it. Our trial trip will be a fight!" called Arcot as he leaped from his seat. The mass of the giant ship pulled him, and he fell slowly toward it.  Into its open port he flew, the others behind him, their suits still on. The door shut behind them as Arcot, at the controls, closed it. As yet they had not released the air supplies. It was airless.  Now the hiss of air, and the quickening of heat crept through it. The water in the tanks thawed as the heat came, soaking through from the great heaters. In minutes the air and heat were normal throughout the great bulk. There was air in power compartments, though no one was expected to go there, for the control room alone need be occupied; vision-screens here viewed every part of the ship, and all about it.  The eyes of the new ship were set in recesses of the tremendously strong cosmium wall, and over them, protecting them, was an infinitely thin, but infinitely strong wall of artificial matter, permanently maintained. It was opaque to all forms of radiation known from the longest Hertzian to the shortest cosmics, save for the very narrow band of visible light. Whether this protection would stop the Thessian beam that was so deadly to lux and relux was not, of course, known. But Arcot hoped it would, and, if that beam was radiant energy, or material particles, it would.  "We'll destroy our station here now, and leave the _Ancient Mariner_ where it is. Of course we are a long way out of the orbit this planetoid followed, due to the effect of the time apparatus, but we can note where it is, and we'll be able to find it when we want it," said Arcot, seated at the great control board now. There were no buttons now, or visible controls; all was mental.  A tiny sphere of artificial matter formed, and shot toward the control board of the time machine outside. It depressed the main switch, and space about them shifted, twisted, and returned to normal. The time apparatus was off for the first time in six weeks.  "Can't fuse that, and we can't crush it. It's made of cosmium, and trying to crush it against the rock would just drive it into it. We'll see what we can do though," muttered Arcot. A plane of artificial matter formed just beneath it, and sheared it from its bed on the planetoid, cutting through the heavy cosmium anchors. The framework lifted, and the apparatus with it. A series of planes, a gigantic honeycomb formed, and the apparatus was cut across again and again, till only small fragments were left of it. Then these were rolled into a ball, and crushed by a sphere of artificial matter beyond all repair. The enemy would never learn their secret.  A huge cylinder of artificial matter cut a great gouge from the plane that was left where the apparatus had been, and a clamp of the same material picked up the _Ancient Mariner_, deposited it there, then covered it with rubble and broken rock. A cosmic flashed on the rock for an instant, and it was glowing, incandescent lava. The _Ancient Mariner_ was buried under a hundred feet of rapidly solidifying rock, but rock which could be fused away from its infusible walls when the time came.  "We're ready to go now--get to work with the radio, Morey, when we get to Earth."  The gravity seemed normal here as they walked about, no accelerations affected them as the ship darted forward, for all its inconceivably great mass, like an arrow, then flashed forward under time control. The sun was far distant now, for six weeks they had been traveling with the section of Eros under time control. But with their tremendous time control plant, and the space control, they reached the solar system in very little time.  It seemed impossible to them that that battle could still be waging, but it was. The ships of Earth and Venus, battling now as a last, hopeless stand, over Chicago, were attempting to stop the press of a great Thessian fleet. Thin, long Negrian, or Sirian ships had joined them in the hour of Earth time that the men had been working. Still, despite the reinforcements, they were falling back.     Chapter XIX  THE BATTLE OF EARTH   It had been an anxious hour for the forces of the Solar System.  They were in the last fine stages of Earth's defense when the general staff received notice that a radio message of tremendous power had penetrated the ray screen, with advice for them. It was signed "Arcot."  "Bringing new weapon. Draw all ships within the atmosphere when I start action, and drive Thessians back into space. Retire as soon as a distance of ten thousand miles is reached. I will then handle the fleet," was the message.  "Gentlemen: We are losing. The move suggested would be eminently poor tactics unless we are sure of being able to drive them. If we don't, we are lost in any event. I trust Arcot. How vote you?" asked General Hetsar Sthel.  The message was relayed to the ships. Scarcely a moment after the message had been relayed, a tremendous battleship appeared in space, just beyond the battle. It shot forward, and planted itself directly in the midst of the battle, brushing aside two huge Thessians in its progress. The Thessian ships bounced off its sides, and reeled away. It lay waiting, making no move. All the Thessian ships above poured the full concentration of their moleculars into its tremendous bulk. A diffused glow of opalescence ran over every ship--save the giant. The moleculars were being reflected from its sides, and their diffused energy attacked the very ships that were sending them!  A fort moved up, and the deadly beam of destruction reached out, luminous even in space.  "Now," muttered Morey, "we shall see what cosmium will stand."  A huge spot on the side of the ship had become incandescent. A vapor, a strange puff of smokiness exploded from it, and disappeared instantly. Another came and faster and faster they followed each other. The cosmium was disintegrating under the ray, but very slowly, breaking first into gaseous cosmic rays, then free, and spreading.  "We will not fight," muttered Morey happily as he saw Arcot shift in his seat.  Arcot picked the moleculars. They reached out, touched the heavy relux of the fort, and it exploded into opalescence that was hazily white, the colors shifted so quickly. A screen sprang into being, and the ray was chopped off. The screen was a mass of darting flames as energies of stupendous magnitude clashed.  Arcot used a bit more of his inconceivable power. The ray struck the screen, and it flashed once--then died into blackness. The fort suddenly crumpled in like a dented can, and rolled clumsily away. The other fort was near now, and started an attack of its own. Arcot chose the artificial matter this time. He was not watching the many attacking ships.  The great ship careened suddenly, fell over heavily to one side. "Foolish of me," said Arcot. "They tried crashing us."  A mass of crumpled, broken relux and lux surrounded by a haze of gas lying against a slight scratch on the great sides, told the story. Eight inches of cosmium does not give way.  Yet another ship tried it. But it stopped several feet away from the real wall of the ship. It struck a wall even more unyielding--artificial matter.  But now Arcot was using this major weapon--artificial matter. Ship after ship, whether fleeing or attacking, was surrounded suddenly by a great sphere of it, a sudden terrific blaze of energy as the sphere struck the ray shield, the control forces now backed by the energy of all the millions of stars of space shattered it in an instant. Then came the inexorable crush of the artificial matter, and a ball of matter alone remained.  But the pressing disc of the battle-front which had been lowering on Chicago, greatest of Earth's metropolises, was lifted. This disc-front was staggering back now as Arcot's mighty ship weakened its strength, and destroyed its morale, under the steady drive of the now hopeful Solarians.  The other gigantic fort moved up now, with twenty of the largest battleships. The fort turned loose its destructive ray--and Arcot tried his new "magnet." It was not a true magnet, but a transformed space field, a field created by the energy of all the universe.  The fort was gigantic. Even Arcot's mighty ship was a small thing beside it, but suddenly it seemed warped and twisted as space curved visibly in a magnetic field of such terrific intensity as to be immeasurable.  Arcot's armory was tested and found not wanting.  Suddenly every Thessian ship in sight ceased to exist. They disappeared. Instantly Arcot threw on all time power, and darted toward Venus. The Thessians were already nearing the planet, and no possible rays could overtake them. An instantaneous touch of the space control, and the mighty ship was within hundreds of miles of the atmosphere.  Space twisted about them, reeled, and was firm. The Thessian fleet was before them in a moment, visible now as they slowed to normal speed. Startled, no doubt, to find before them the ship they had fled, they charged on for a space. Then, as though by some magic, they stopped and exploded in gouts of light.  When space had twisted, seconds before, it was because Arcot had drawn on the enormous power of space to an extent that had been appreciable even to it--ten sols. That was forty million tons of matter a second, and for a hundredth part of a second it had flowed. Before them, in a vast plane, had been created an infinitesimally thin film of artificial matter, four hundred thousand tons of it, and into this invisible, infinitely hard barrier, the Thessian fleet had rammed. And it was gone.  "I think," said Arcot softly, as he took off his headpiece, "that the beginning of the end is in sight."  "And I," said Morey, "think it is now out of sight. Half a dozen ships stopped. And they are gone now, to warn the others."  "What warning? What can they tell? Only that their ships were destroyed by something they couldn't see." Arcot smiled. "I'm going home."     Chapter XX  DESTRUCTION   Some time later, Arcot spoke. "I have just received a message from Zezdon Fentes that he has an important communication to make, so I will go down to New York instead of to Chicago, if you gentlemen do not mind. Morey will take you to Chicago in the tender, and I can find Zezdon Fentes."  Zezdon Fentes' message was brief. He had discovered from the minds of several who had been killed by the magnetic field Arcot had used, and not destroyed, that they had a base in this universe. Thett's base was somewhere near the center of the galaxy, on a system of unusually large planets, circling a rather small star. But what star their minds had not revealed.  "It's up to us then to locate said star," said Arcot, after listening to Zezdon Fentes' account: "I think the easiest way will be to follow them home. We can go to your world, Zezdon Fentes, and see what they are doing there, and drive them off. Then to yours, Stel Felso. I place your world second as it is far better able to defend itself than is Ortol. It is agreeable?"  It was, and the ship which had been hanging in the atmosphere over New York, where Zezdon Afthen, Fentes and Inthel had come to it in a taxi-ship, signaled for the crowd to clear away above. The enormous bulk of the shining machine, the savior of Earth, had attracted a very great amount of attention, naturally, and thousands on thousands of hardy souls had braved the cold of the fifteen mile height with altitude suits or in small ships. Now they cleared away, and as the ship slowly rose, the tremendous concentrated mental well-wishing of the thousands reached the men within the ship. "That," observed Morley, "is one thing cosmium won't stop. In some ways I wish it would--because the mental power that could be wielded by any great number of those highly advanced Thessians, if they know its possibilities, is not a thing to neglect."  "I can answer that, terrestrian," thought Zezdon Afthen. "Our instruments show great mental powers, and great ability to concentrate the will in mental processes, but they indicate a very slight development of these abilities. Our race, despite the fact that our mental powers are much less than those of such men as Arcot and yourself, have done, and can do many things your greater minds cannot, for we have learned the direction of the will. We need not fear the will of the Thessians. I feel confident of that!"  The ship was in space now, and as Arcot directed it toward Ortol, far far across the Island, he threw on, for the moment, the combined power of space distortion and time fields. Instantly the sun vanished, and when, less than a second later, he cut off the space field, and left only the time, the constellations were instantly recognizable. They were within a dozen light years of Ortol.  "Morey, may I ask what you call this machine?" asked Torlos.  "You may, but I can't answer," laughed Morey. "We were so anxious to get it going that we didn't name it. Any suggestions?"  For a moment none of them made any suggestions, then slowly came Arcot's thoughts, clear and sharp, the thoughts of carefully weighed decision.  "The swiftest thing that ever was _thought_! The most irresistible thing, _thought_, for nothing can stop its progress. The most destructive thing, _thought_. Thought, the greatest constructor, the greatest destroyer, the product of mind, and producer of powers, the greatest of powers. Thought is controlled by the mind. Let us call it _Thought_!"  "Excellent, Arcot, excellent. The _Thought_, the controller of the powers of the cosmos!" cried Morey.  "But the _Thought_ has not been christened, save in battle, and then it had no name. Let us emblazen its name on it now," suggested Wade.  Stopping their motion through space, but maintaining a time field that permitted them to work without consuming precious time, Arcot formed some more cosmium, but now he subjected it to a special type of converted field, and into the cosmium, he forced some light photons, half bound, half free. The fixture he formed into the letters, and welded forever on the gigantic prow of the ship, and on its huge sides. _Thought_, it stood in letters ten feet high, made of clear transparent cosmium, and the golden light photons, imprisoned in it, the slowly disintegrating lux metal, would cause those letters to shine for countless aeons with the steady golden light they now had.  The _Thought_ continued on now, and as they slowed their progress for Ortol, they saw that messengers of Thett had barely arrived. The fort here too had been razed to the ground, and now they were concentrating over the largest city of Ortol. Their rays were beating down on the great ray screen that terrestrial engineers had set up, protecting the city, as Earth had been protected. But the fleet that stood guard was small, and was rapidly being destroyed. A fort broke free, and plunged at last for the ray screen. Its relux walls glowed a thousand colors as the tremendous energy of the ray-screen struck them--but it was through!  A molecular ray reached down for the city--and stopped halfway in a tremendous coruscating burst of light and energy. Yet there was none of the sheen of the ray screen. Merely light.  The fort was still driving downward. Then suddenly it stopped, and the side dented in like the side of a can some one has stepped on, and it came to sudden rest against an invisible, impenetrable barrier. A molecular reached down from somewhere in space, hit the ray screen of Ortol, which the Thessians had attacked for hours, and the screen flashed into sudden brilliance, and disappeared. The ray struck the Thessian fort, and the fort burst into tremendous opalescence, while the invisible barrier the ray had struck was suddenly a great sheet of flaming light. In less than half a second the opalescence was gone, the fort shuddered, and shrieked out of the planet's atmosphere, a mass of lux now, and susceptible to the moleculars. And everything that lived within that fort had died instantly and painlessly.  The fleet which had been preparing to follow the leading fort was suddenly stopped; it halted indecisively.  Then the _Thought_ became visible as its great golden letters showed suddenly, streaking up from distant space. Every ship turned cosmic and moleculars on it. The cosmic rebounded from the cosmium walls, and from the artificial matter that protected the eyes. The moleculars did not affect either, but the invisible protective sheet that the _Thought_ was maintaining in the Ortolian atmosphere became misty as it fought the slight molecular rebounds.  The _Thought_ went into action. The fort which remained was the point of attack. The fort had turned its destructive ray on the cosmium ship with the result that, as before, the cosmium slowly disintegrated into puffs of cosmic rays. The vapor seemed to boil out, puff suddenly, then was gone. Arcot put up a wall of artificial matter to test the effect. The ray went right through the matter, without so much as affecting it. He tried a sheet of pure energy, an electro-magnetic energy stream of tremendous power. The ray bent sharply to one side. But in a moment the Thessians had realigned it.  "It's a photonic stream, but of some type that doesn't affect ordinary matter, but only artificial matter such as lux, relux, or cosmium. If the artificial matter would only fight it, I'd be all right." The thought running through Arcot's mind reached the others.  A tremendous burst of light energy to the rear announced the fact that a Thessian had crashed against the artificial matter wall that surrounded the ship. Arcot was throwing the Thessian destructive beam from side to side now, and twice succeeded in misdirecting it so that it hit the enemy machines.  The _Thought_ sent out its terrific beam of magnetic energy. The ray was suddenly killed, and the fort cruised helplessly on. Its driving apparatus was dead. The diffused cosmic reached out, and as the magnetic field, the relux and the cosmics interacted, the great fort was suddenly blue-white--then instantly a dust that scattered before an enormous blast of air.  From the _Thought_ a great shell of artificial matter went, a visible, misty wall, that curled forward, and wrapped itself around the Thessian ships with a motion of tremendous speed, yet deceptive, for it seemed to billow and flow.  A Thessian warship decided to brush it away--and plowed into inconceivable strength. The ship crumpled to a mass of broken relux.  The greater part of the Thessian fleet had already fled, but there remained half a hundred great battleships. And now, within half a million miles of the planet, there began a battle so weird that astronomers who watched could not believe it.  From behind the _Thought_, where it hung motionless beyond the misty wall, a Thing came.  The Thessian ships had realized now that the misty sphere that walled them in was impenetrable, and their rays were off, for none they now had would penetrate it. The forts were gone.  But the Thing that came behind the _Thought_ was a ship, a little ship of the same misty white, and it flowed into, and through the wall, and was within their prison. The Thessian ships turned their rays toward it, and waited. What was this thing?  The ovaloid ship which drifted so slowly toward them suddenly seemed to jerk, and from it reached pseudopods! An amoeba on a titanic scale! It writhed its way purposefully toward the nearest ship, and while that ship waited, a pseudopod reached out, and suddenly drove through the four foot relux armor! A second pseudopod followed with lightning rapidity, and in an instant the ship had been split from end to end!  Now a hundred rays were leaping toward the thing, and the rays burst into fire and gouts of light, blackened, burned pseudopods seemed to fall from the thing and hastily it retreated from the enclosure, flowing once more through the wall that stopped their rays.  But another Thing came. It was enormous, a mile long, a great, shining scaly thing, a dragon, and on its mighty neck was mounted an enormous, distorted head, with great flat nose and huge flapping nostrils. It was a Thessian head! The mouth, fifty feet across, wrinkled into an horrific grin, and broken, stained teeth of iron showed in the mouth. Great talons upraised, it rent the misty wall that bound them, and writhed its awful length in. The swish of its scales seemed to come to the watchers, as it chased after a great battleship whose pilot fled in terror. Faster than the mighty spaceship the awful Thing caught it in mighty talons that ripped through solid relux. Scratching, fluttering enormous, blood-red wings, the silvery claws tore away great masses of relux, sending them flying into space.  Again rays struck at it. Cosmic and moleculars with blinding pencils of light. For now in the close space of the Wall was an atmosphere, the air of two great warships, and though the space was great, the air in the ships was dense.  The rays struck its awful face. The face burst into light, and black, greasy smoke steamed up, as the thing writhed and twisted horribly, awful screams ringing out. Then it was free, and half the face was burned away, and a grinning, bleeding, half-cooked face writhed and screamed in anger at them. It darted at the nearest ship, and ripped out that ray that burned it--and quivered into death. It quivered, then quickly faded into mist, a haze, and was gone!  A last awful thing--a thing they had not noticed as all eyes watched that Thing--was standing by the rent in the Sphere now, the gigantic Thessian, with leering, bestial jaws, enormous, squat limbs, the webbed fingers and toes, and the heavy torso of his race, grinning at them. In one hand was a thing--and his jaws munched. Thett's men stared in horror as they recognized that thing in his hand--a Thessian body! He grinned happily and reached for a battleship--a ray burned him. He howled, and leaped into their midst.  Then the Thessians went mad. All fought, and they fought each other, rays of all sorts, their moleculars and their cosmics, while in their midst the Giant howled his glee, and laughed and laughed--  Eventually it was over, and the last limping Thessian ship drove itself crazily against the wreck of its last enemy. And only wreckage was left.  "Lord, Arcot! Why in the Universe did you do that--and how did you conceive those horrors?" asked Morey, more than a little amazed at the tactics Arcot had displayed.  Arcot shook himself, and disconnected his controls. "Why--why I don't know. I don't know what made me do that, I'm sure. I never imagined anything like that dragon thing--how did--"  His keen eyes fixed themselves suddenly on Zezdon Fentes, and their tremendous hypnotic power beat down the resistance of the Ortolian's trained mind. Arcot's mind opened for the others the thoughts of Zezdon Fentes.  He had acted as a medium between the minds of the Thessians, and Arcot. Taking the horror-ideas of the Thessians, he had imprinted them on Arcot's mind while Arcot was at work with the controls. In Arcot's mind, they had acted exactly as had the ideas that night on Earth, only here the demonstration had been carried to the limit, and the horror ideas were compounded to the utmost. The Thessians, highly developed minds though they were, were not resistant and they had broken. The Allies, with their different horror-ideas, had been but slightly affected.  "We will leave you on Ortol, Zezdon Fentes. We know you have done much, and perhaps your own mind has given a bit. We hope you recover. I think you agree with me, Zezdon Afthen and Inthel?" thought Arcot.  "We do, heartily, and are heartily sorry that one of our race has acted in this way. Let us proceed to Talso, as soon as possible. You might send Fentes down in a shell of artificial matter," suggested Zezdon Afthen.  "Which," said Arcot, after this had been done, and they were on their way to Talso, "shows the danger of a mad _Thought_!"     Chapter XXI  THE POWER OF "_THE THOUGHT_"   But it seemed, or must have seemed to any infinite being capable of watching it as it moved now, that the _Thought_ was a mad thought. With the time control opened to the limit, and a touch of the space control, it fled across the Universe at a velocity such as no other thing was capable of.  One star--it flashed to a disc, loomed enormous--overpowering--then suddenly they were flashing _through_ it! The enormous coils fed their current into the space-coils and the time field, and the ship seemed to twist and writhe in distorted space as the gravitational field of a giant star, and a giant ship's space field fought for a fraction of time so short as to be utterly below measurement. Then the ship was gone--and behind it a star, the center of which had suddenly been hurled into another space forever, as the counteracting, gravitational field of the outer layers was removed for a moment, and only its own enormous density affected space, writhed and collapsed upon itself, to explode into a mighty sea of flames. Planets it formed, we know, by a process such as can happen when only this man-made accident happens.  But the ship fled on, its great coils partly discharged, but still far more charged than need be.  It was minutes to Talso where it had been hours with the _Ancient Mariner_, but now they traveled with the speed of _Thought_!  Talso too was the scene of a battle, and more of a battle than Ortol had been, for here where more powerful defensive forces had been active, the Thessians had been more vengeful. All their remaining ships seemed concentrated here. And the great molecular screen that terrestrian engineers had flung up here had already fallen. Great holes had opened in it, as two great forts, and a thousand ships, some mighty battleships of the intergalactic spaces, some little scout cruisers, had turned their rays on the struggling defensive machines. It had held for hours, thanks to the tremendous tubes that Talso had in their power-distribution stations, but in the end had fallen, but not before many of their largest cities had been similarly defended, and the people of the others had scattered broadcast.  True, wherever they might be, a diffused molecular would find them and destroy all life save under the few screens, but if the Thessians once diffused their rays, without entering the atmosphere, the broken screen would once more be able to hold.  No fleet had kept the Thessian forces out of this atmosphere, but dozens of more adequately powered artificial matter bomb stations had taught Thett respect for Talso. But Talso's own ray screen had stopped their bombs. They could only send their bombs as high as the screen. They did not have Arcot's tremendous control power to maintain the matter without difficulty even beyond a screen.  At last the screen had fallen, and the Thessian ships, a hole once made, were able to move, and kept that hole always under them, though if it once were closed, they would again have the struggle to open it.  Exploding matter bombs had twice caused such spatial strains and ionized conditions as to come near closing it, but finally the Thessian fleet had arranged a ring of ships about the hole, and opened a cylinder of rays that reached down to the planet.  Like some gigantic plow the rays tore up mountains, oceans, glaciers and land. Tremendous chasms opened in straight lines as it plowed along. Unprotected cities flashed into fountains of rock and soil and steel that leaped upwards as the rays touched, and were gone. Protected cities, their screens blazing briefly under the enormous ray concentrations as the ships moved on, unheeding, stood safe on islands of safety amidst the destruction. Here in the lower air, where ions would be so plentiful, Thett did not try to break down the screens, for the air would aid the defenders.  Finally, as Thett's forces had planned, they came to one of the ionized layer ray-screen stations that was still projecting its cone of protective screening to the layer above. Every available ray was turned on that station, and, designed as it was for protecting part of a world, the station was itself protected, but slowly, slowly as its already heated tubes weakened their electronic emission, the disc of ions retreated more and more toward the station, as, like some splashing stream, the Thessian rays played upon it forcing it back. A rapidly accelerating retreat, faster and faster, as the disc changed from the dull red of normal defense to the higher and bluer quanta of failing, less complete defense, the disc of interference retreated.  Then, with a flash of light, and a roar as the soil below spouted up, the station was gone. It had failed.  Instantly the ring of ships expanded as the great screen was weakened by the withdrawal of this support. Wider was the path of destruction now as the forces moved on.  But high, high in the sky, far out of sight of the naked eye, was a tiny spot that was in reality a giant ship. It was flashing forward, and in moments it was visible. Then, as another deserted city vanished, it was above the Thessian fleet.  Their rays were directed downward through a hole that was even larger. A second station had gone with that city. But, as by magic, the hole closed up, and chopped their rays off with a decisiveness that startled them. The interference was so sharp now that not even the dullest of reds showed where their beams touched. The close interference was giving off only radio! In amazement they looked for this new station of such enormous power that their combined rays did not noticeably affect it. A world had been fighting their rays unsuccessfully. What single station could do this, if the many stations of the world could not? There was but one they knew of, and they turned now to search for the ship they knew must be there.  "No horrors this time; just clean, burning energy," muttered Arcot.  It was clean, and it was burning. In an instant one of the forts was a mass of opalescence that shifted so swiftly it was purest white, then rocketed away, lifeless, and no longer relux.  The other fort had its screen up, though its power, designed to withstand the attack of a fleet of enormous intergalactic, matter-driven, fighting ships lasted but an instant under the driving power of half a million million suns, concentrated in one enormous ray of energy. The sheer energy of the ray itself, molecular ray though it was, heated the material it struck to blinding incandescence even as it hurled it at a velocity close to that of light into outer space. With little sparkling flashes battleships of the void after giant cruisers flashed into lux, and vanished under the ray.  A tremendous combined ray of magnetism and cosmic ray energy replaced the molecular, and the ships exploded into a dust as fine as the primeval gas from which came all matter.  Sweeping energy, so enormous that the defenses of the ships did not even operate against it, shattered ship after ship, till the few that remained turned, and, faster than the pursuing energies could race through space, faster than light, headed for their base.  "That was fair fight; energy against energy," said Arcot delightedly, for his new toy, which made playthings of suns and fed on the cosmic energy of a universe, was behaving nicely, "and as I said, Stel Felso Theu, at the beginning of this war, the greater Power wins, always. And in our island here, I have five hundred thousand million separate power plants, each generating at the rate of decillions of ergs a second, backing this ship.  "Your world will be safe now, and we will head for our last embattled ally, Sirius." The titanic ship turned, and disappeared from the view of the madly rejoicing billions of Talso below, as it sped, far faster than light, across a universe to relieve another sorely tried civilization.  Knowing their cause was lost, hopeless in the knowledge that nothing known to them could battle that enormous force concentrated in one ship, the _Thought_, the Thessians had but one aim now, to do all the damage in their power before leaving.  Already their tremendous, unarmed and unarmored transports were departing with their hundreds of thousands from that base system for the far-off Island of Space from which they had come. Their battlefleets were engaged in destroying all the cities of the allies, and those other helpless races of our system that they could. Those other inhabited worlds, many of which were completely wiped out because Arcot had no knowledge of them, were relieved only when the general call for retreat to protect the mother planet was sent out.  But Sirius was looming enormous before them. And its planets, heavily defended now by the combined Sirian, Terrestrial and Venerian fleets and great ray screens as well as a few matter-bomb stations, were suffering losses none the less. For the old Sixth of Negra, the Third here, had fallen. Slipping in on the night side of the planet, all power off, and so sending forth no warning impulses till it actually fell through the ray screen, a small fleet of scouts had entered. Falling still under simple gravity, they had been missed by the rays till they had fallen to so small a distance, that no humans or men of our allied systems could have stopped, but only their enormous iron boned strength permitted them to resist the acceleration they used to avert collision with the planet. Then scattering swiftly, they had blasted the great protective screen stations by attacking on the sides, where the ray screen projectors were not mounted. Designed to protect above, they had no side armor, and the Sixth was opened to attack.  Two and one-half billion people lost their lives painlessly and instantaneously as tremendous diffused moleculars played on the revolving planet.  Arcot arrived soon after this catastrophe. The Thessians left almost immediately, after the loss of three hundred or more ships. One hundred and fifty wrecks were found. The rest were so blasted by the forces which attacked them, that no traces could be found, and no count made.  But as those ships fled back to their base, Arcot, with the wonderfully delicate mental control of his ship, was able to watch them, and follow them; for, invisible under normal conditions, by twisting space in the same manner that they did he was able to see them flee, and follow.  Light year after light year they raced toward the distant base. They reached it in two hours, and Arcot saw them from a distance sink to the various worlds. There were twelve gigantic worlds, each far larger than Jupiter of Sol, and larger than Stwall of Talso's sun, Renl.  "I think," said Arcot as he stopped the ship at a third of a light year, "that we had best destroy those planets. We may kill many men, and innocent non-combatants, but they have killed many of our races, and it is necessary. There are, no doubt, other worlds of this Universe here that we do not know of that have felt the vengeance of Thett, and if we can cause such trouble to them by destroying these worlds, and putting the fear of our attacking their mother world into them, they will call off those other fleets. I could have been invisible to Thett's ships as we followed them here, and for the greater part of the way I was, for I was sufficiently out of their time-rate, so that they were visible only by the short ultra-violet, which would have put in their infra-red, and, no photo-electric cell will work on quanta of such low energy. When at last I was sure of the sun for which they were heading, I let them see us, and they know we are aware of their base, and that we can follow them.  "I will destroy one of these worlds, and follow a fleet as it starts for their home nebula. Gradually, as they run, I will fade into invisibility, and they will not know that I have dropped back here to complete the work, but will think I am still following. Probably they will run to some other nebula in an effort to throw me off, but they will most certainly send back a ship to call the fleets here to the defense of Thett.  "I think that is the best plan. Do you agree?"  "Arcot," asked Morey slowly, "if this race attempts to settle another Universe, what would that indicate of their own?"  "Hmmm--that it was either populated by their own race or that another race held the parts they did not, and that the other race was stronger," replied Arcot. "The thought idea in their minds has always been a single world, single solar system as their home, however."  "And single solar systems cannot originate in this Space," replied Morey, referring to the fact that in the primeval gas from which all matter in this Universe and all others came, no condensation of mass less than thousands of millions of times that of a sun could form and continue.  "We can only investigate--and hope that they do not inhabit the whole system, for I am determined that, unpleasant as the idea may be, there is one race that we cannot afford to have visiting us, and it is going to be permanently restrained in one way or another. I will first have a conference with their leaders and if they will not be peaceful--the _Thought_ can destroy or make a Universe! But I think that a second race holds part of that Universe, for several times we have read in their minds the thought of the 'Mighty Warless Ones of Venone.'"  "And how do you plan to destroy so large a planet as these are?" asked Morey, indicating the telectroscope screen.  "Watch and see!" said Arcot.  They shot suddenly toward the distant sun, and as it expanded, planets came into view. Moving ever slower on the time control, Arcot drove the ship toward a gigantic planet at a distance of approximately 300,000,000 miles from its primary, the sun of this system.  Arcot fell into step with the planet as it moved about in its orbit, and watched the speed indicator carefully.  "What's the orbital speed, Morey?" asked Arcot.  "About twelve and a half miles per second," replied the somewhat mystified Morey.  "Excellent, my dear Watson," replied Arcot. "And now does my dear friend know the average molecular velocity of ordinary air?"  "Why, about one-third of a mile a second, average."  "And if that planet as a whole should stop moving, and the individual molecules be given the entire energy, what would their average velocity be? And what temperature would that represent?" asked Arcot.  "Good--Why, they would have to have the same kinetic energy as individuals as they now have as a whole, and that would be an average molecular velocity in random motion of 12.5 miles a second--giving about--about--about--twelve thousand degrees centigrade!" exclaimed Morey in surprise. "That would put it in the far blue-white region!"  "Perfect. Now watch." Arcot donned the headpiece he had removed, and once more took charge. He was very far from the planet, as distances go, and they could not see his ship. But he wanted to be seen. So he moved closer, and hung off to the sunward side of the planet, then moved to the night side, but stayed in the light. In seconds, a battlefleet was out attempting to destroy him.  Surrounding the ship with a wall of artificial matter, lest they annoy him, he set to work.  Directly in the orbit of the planet, a faint mistiness appeared, and rapidly solidified to a titanic cup, directly in the path of the planet.  Arcot was pouring energy into the making of that matter at such a rate that space was twisted now about them. The meter before them, which had not registered previously, was registering now, and had moved over to three. Three sols--and was still climbing. It stopped when ten were reached. Ten times the energy of our sun was pouring into that condensation, and it solidified quickly.  The Thessians had seen the danger now. It was less than ten minutes away from their planet, and now great numbers of ships of all sorts started up from the planet, swarming out like rats from a sinking vessel.  Majestically the great world moved on in its orbit toward the thin wall of infinite strength and infinite toughness. Already Thessian battleships were tearing at that wall with rays of all types, and the wall sputtered back little gouts of light, and remained. The meters on the _Thought_ were no longer registering. The wall was built, and now Arcot had all the giant power of the ship holding it there. Any attempt to move it or destroy it, and all the energy of the Universe would rush to its defense!  The atmosphere of the planet reached the wall. Instantly, as the pressure of that enormous mass of air touched it, the wall fought, and burst into a blaze of energy. It was fighting now, and the meter that measured sun-powers ran steadily, swiftly up the scale. But the men were not watching the meter; they were watching the awesome sight of Man stopping a world in its course! Turning a world from its path!  But the meter climbed suddenly, and the world was suddenly a tremendous blaze of light. The solid rock had struck the giant cup, 110,000 miles in diameter. It was silent, as a world pitted its enormous kinetic energy against the combined forces of a universe. Soundless--and as hopeless. Its strength was nothing, its energy pitted unnoticed against the energy of five hundred thousand million suns--as vain as those futile attempts of the Thessian battleships on the invulnerable walls of the _Thought_.  What use is there to attempt description of that scene as 2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of rock and metal and matter crashed against a wall of energy, immovable and inconceivable. The planet crumpled, and split wide. A thousand pieces, and suddenly there was a further mistiness about it, and the whole enormous mass, seeming but a toy, as it was from this distance in space, and as it was in this ship, was enclosed in that same, immovable, unalterable wall of energy.  The ship was as quiet and noiseless, as without indication of strain as when it hummed its way through empty space. But the planet crumpled and twirled, and great seas of energy flashed about it.  The world, seeming tiny, was dashed helpless against a wall that stopped it, but the wall flared into equal and opposite energy, so that matter was raised not to the twelve thousand Morey had estimated but nearer twenty-four thousand degrees. It was over in less than half an hour, and a broken, misshapen mass of blue incandescence floated in space. It would fall now, toward the sun, and it would, because it was motionless and the sun moved, take an eccentric orbit about that sun. Eventually, perhaps, it would wipe out the four inferior planets, or perhaps it would be broken as it came within the Roches limit of that sun. But the planet was now a miniature sun, and not so very small, at that.  And from every planet of the system was pouring an assorted stream of ships, great and small, and they all set panic-stricken across the void in the same direction. They had seen the power of the _Thought_, and did not contest any longer its right to this system.     Chapter XXII  THETT   Through the utter void of intergalactic space sped a tiny shell, a wee mite of a ship. Scarcely twenty feet long, it was one single power plant. The man who sat alone in it, as it tore through the void at the maximum speed that even its tiny mass was capable of, when every last twist possible had been given to the distorted time fields, watched a far, far galaxy ahead that seemed unchanging.  Hours, days sped by, and he did not move from his position in the ship. But the ship had crossed the great gulf, and was speeding through the galaxy now. He was near the end. At a reckless speed, he sat motionless before the controls, save for slight movements of supple fingers that directed the ship at a mad pace about some gigantic sun and its family of planets. Suns flashed, grew to discs, and were left behind in the briefest instant.  The ship slowed, the terrific pace it had been holding fell, and dull whine of overworked generators fell to a contented hum. A star was looming, expanding before it. The great sun glowed the characteristic red of a giant as the ship slowed to less than a light-speed, and turned toward a gigantic planet that circled the red sun. The planet was very close to 50,000 miles in diameter, and it revolved at a distance of four and one half billions of miles from the surface of its sun, which made the distance to the center of the titanic primary four billion, eight hundred million miles, in round figures, for the sun's diameter was close to six hundred and fifty million miles! Greater even than Antares, whose diameter is close to four hundred million miles, was this star of another universe, and even from the billions of miles of distance that its planet revolved, the disc was enormous, a titanic disc of dull red flame. But so low was its surface temperature, that even that enormous disc did not overheat the giant planet.  The planet's atmosphere stretched out tens of thousands of miles into space, and under the enormous gravitational acceleration of the tremendous mass of that planet, it was near the surface a blanket dense as water. There was no temperature change upon it, though its night was one hundred hours long, and its day the same. The centrifugal force of the rapid rotation of this enormous body had flattened it when still liquid till it seemed now more of the shape of a pumpkin than of an orange. It was really a double planet, for its satellite was a world of one hundred thousand miles diameter, yet smaller in comparison to its giant primary than is Luna in comparison to Earth. It revolved at a distance of five million miles from its primary's center, and it, too, was swarming with its people.  But the racing ship sped directly toward the great planet, and shrieked its way down through the atmosphere, till its outer shell was radiating far in the violet.  Straight it flew to where a gigantic city sprawled in the heaped, somber masonry, but in some order yet, for on closer inspection the appearance of interlaced circles came over the edge of the giant cities. Ray screens were circular and the city was protected by dozens of stations.  The scout was going well under the speed of light now, and a message, imperative and commanding, sped ahead of him. Half a dozen patrol boats flashed up, and fell in beside him, and with him raced to a gigantic building that reared its somber head from the center of the city.  Under a white sky they proceeded to it, and landed on its roof. From the little machine the single man came out. Using the webbed hands and feet that had led the Allied scientists to think them an aquatic race, he swam upward, and through the water-dense atmosphere of the planet toward the door.  Trees overtopped the building, for it had but four stories, above ground, though it was the tallest in the city. The trees, like seaweed, floated most of their enormous weight in the dense air, but the buildings under the gravitational acceleration, which was more than one hundred times Earth's gravity, could not be built very high ere they crumple under their own weight. Though one of these men weighed approximately two hundred pounds on Earth, for all their short stature, on this planet their weight was more than ten tons! Only the enormously dense atmosphere permitted them to move.  And such an atmosphere! At a temperature of almost exactly 360 degrees centigrade, there was no liquid water on the planet, naturally. At that temperature water cannot be a liquid, no matter what the pressure, and it was a gas. In their own bodies there was liquid water, but only because they lived on heat, their muscles absorbed their energy for work from the heat of the air. They carried in their own muscles refrigeration, and, with that aid, were able to keep liquid water for their life processes. With death, the water evaporated. Almost the entire atmosphere was made up of oxygen, with but a trace of nitrogen, and some amount of carbon dioxide.  Here their enormous strength was not needed, as Arcot had supposed, to move their own bodies, but to enable them to perform the ordinary tasks of life. The mere act of lifting a thing weighing perhaps ten pounds on Earth, here required a lifting force of more than half a ton! No wonder enormous strength had been developed! Such things as a man might carry with him, perhaps a ray pistol, would weigh half a ton; his money would weigh near to a hundred pounds!  But--there were no guns on this world. A man could throw a stone perhaps a short distance, but when a gravitational acceleration of more than a half a mile per second acted on it, and it was hurled through an atmosphere dense as water--what chance was there for a long range?  But these little men of enormous strength did not know other schemes of existence, save in the abstract, and as things of comical peculiarity. To them life on a planet like Earth was as life to a terrestrian on a planetoid such as Ceres, Juno or Eros would have seemed. Even on Thettsost, the satellite planet of Thett, life was strange, and they used lux roofs over their cities, though their weight there was four tons!  As the scout swam through the dense atmosphere of his world toward the entrance way to the building, guards stopped him, and examined his credentials. Then he was led through long halls, and down a shaft ten stories below the planet's surface, to where a great table occupied a part of a low ceilinged, wide room. This room was shielded, interference screens of all known kinds lined the hollow walls, no rays could reach through it to the men within. The guard changed, and new men examined the scout's credentials, and he was led still deeper into the bowels of the planet. Once more the guard changed, and he entered a room guarded not by single shields but by triple, and walled with six foot relux, and ceiled with the same strong material. But here, under the enormous gravity, even its great strength required aid in the form of pillars.  A giant of his race sat before a low table. The table ran half the length of the room, and beside it sat four other men. But there were places for more than two dozen.  "A scout from the colony? What news?" demanded the leader. His voice was a growl, deep and throaty.  "Oh mighty Sthanto, I bring news of resistance. We waited too long, in our explorations, and those men of World 3769-8482730-3 have learned too much. We were wrong. They had found the secret of exceeding the speed of light, and can travel through space fully as rapidly as we can, and now, since by some means we cannot fathom, they have learned to combine both our own system and theirs, they have one enormous engine of destruction that travels across their huge universe in less time than it takes us to travel across a planetary system.  "Our cause is lost, which is by far the least of our troubles. Thett is in danger. We cannot hope to combat that ship."  "Thalt--what means have we. Can we not better them?" demanded Sthanto of his chief scientist.  "Great Sthanto, we know that such a substance can be made when pressure can be brought to bear on cosmic rays under the influence of field 24-7649-321, but that field cannot be produced, because no sufficient concentration of energy is available. Energy cannot be released rapidly enough to replace the losses when the field is developing. The fact that they have that material indicates their possession of an unguessed and terrific energy source. I would have said that there was no energy greater than the energy of matter, but we know the properties of this material and that the triple ray which has at last been perfected, can be produced providing your order for all energy sources is given, will release its energy at a speed comparable to the rate of energy relux in a twin ray, but that the release takes place only in the path of the ray."  "What more, Scout?" asked Sthanto smoothly.  "The ship first appeared in connection with our general attack on world 3769-8482730-3. The attack was near success, their screens were already failing. They have devised a new and very ionized layer as a conductor. It was exceedingly difficult to break, and since their sun had been similarly screened, we could not throw masses of that matter upon them.  "In another sthan of time, we would have destroyed their world. Then the ship appeared. It has molecular rays, magnetic beams and cosmic rays, and a fourth weapon we know nothing of. It has molecular screens, we suspect, but has not had occasion to use them.  "Our heaviest molecular screens flash under their molecular rays. Ordinary screens fall instantly without momentary defense. The ray power is incalculable.  "Their magnetic beams are used in conjunction with cosmics. The action of the two causes the relux to induce current, and due to reaction of currents on the magnetic field--"  "And the resistance due to the relux, the relux is first heated to incandescence and then the ship opens out as the air pressure bends the magnetically softened relux?" finished Thalt.  "No, the effect is even more terrific. It explodes into powder," replied the scout.  "And what happens to worlds that the magnetic ray touches?" inquired the scientist.  "A corner of it touched the world we fought over, and the world shook," replied the colonist.  "And the last weapon?" asked Sthanto, his voice soft now.  "It seems a ghost. It is a mistiness that comes into existence like a cloud, and what it touches is crushed, what it rams is shattered. It surrounds the great ship, and machines crashing into it at a speed of more than six times that of light are completely destroyed, without in the slightest injuring the shield.  "Then--what caused my departure from the colony--it showed once more its unutterable power. The mistiness formed in the path of our colonial world, number 3769-1-5, and the planet swept against that wall of mistiness, and was shattered, and turned in less than five sthan to a ball of blue-white fire. The wall stopped the planet in its motion. We could not fight that machine, and we left the worlds. The others are coming," finished the scout.  The ruler turned his slightly smiling face to the commander of his armies, who sat beside him.  "Give orders," he said softly, almost gently, "that a triple ray station be set up under the direction of Thalt, and further notice that all power be made instantly available to it. Add that the colonists are returning defeated, and bringing danger at their heels. The triple ray will destroy each ship as it enters the system." His hand under the table pushed an invisible protuberance, and from the perfectly conducting relux floor to the equally perfectly conducting ceiling, and between four pillars grouped around the spot where the scout stood, terrific arcs suddenly came into being. They lasted for the thousandth part of a second, and when they suddenly died away, as swiftly as they had come, there was not even ash where the scout had been.  "Have you any suggestions, Thalt?" he asked of the scientist, his voice as soft as before.  "I quite agree with your conduct so far, but the future conduct you had planned is quite unsatisfactory," replied the scientist. The ruler sat motionless in his great seat, staring fixedly at the scientist. "I think it is time I take your place, therefore." The place where the ruler had been was suddenly seen as through a dark cloud, then the cloud was gone, and with it the king, only his relux chair, and the bits of lux or relux that had been about his garments remained.  "He was a fool," said the scientist softly, as he rose, "to plan on removing his scientist. Are there any who object to my succession?"  "No one objects," said Faslar, the ex-king's Prime Minister and councilor.  "Then I think, Phantal, Commander of planetary forces, that you had best see Ranstud, my assistant, and follow out the plan outlined by my predecessor. And you Tastal, Commander of Fleets, had best bring your fleets near the planets for protection. Go."  "May I suggest, mighty Thalt," said Faslar after the others had left, "that my knowledge will be exceedingly useful to you. You have two commanders, neither of whom loves you, and neither of whom is highly capable. The family of Thadstil would be glad to learn who removed that honored gentleman, and the family of Datstir would gladly support him who brought the remover of their head to them.  "This would remove two unwelcome menaces, and open places for such as Ranstud and your son Warrtil.  "And," he said hastily as he saw a slight shift in Thalt's eyes, "I might say further that the bereaved ones of Parthel would find great interest in certain of my papers, which are only protected by my personal constant watchfulness."  "Ah, so? And what of Kelston Faln, Faslar?" smiled the new Sthanta.  Thalt's hand relaxed and they started a conversation and discussion on means of defense.     Chapter XXIII  VENONE   Up from Earth, out of its clear blue sky, and into the glare and dark of space and near a sun the ship soared. They had been holding it motionless over New York, and now as it rose, hundreds of tiny craft, and a few large excursion ships followed it until it was out of Earth's atmosphere. Then--it was gone. Gone across space, racing toward that far Universe at a speed no other thing could equal. In minutes the great disc of the Universe had taken form behind them, as they took their route photographs to find their way back to Earth after the battle, if still they could come.  Then into the stillness of the Intergalactic spaces.  "This will be our first opportunity to test the full speed of this ship. We have never tried its velocity, and we should measure it now. Take a sight on the diameter of the Island, as seen from here, Morey. Then we will travel ten seconds, and look again."  Half a million light years from the center of the Island now, the great disc spread out over the vast space behind them, apparently the size of a dinner plate at about thirty inches distance, it was more than two hundred and fifty thousand light years across. Checking carefully, Morey read their distance as just shy of five hundred thousand light years.  "Hold on--here we go," called Arcot. Space was suddenly black, and beside them ran the twin ghost ships that follow always when space is closed to the smallest compass, for light leaving, goes around a space whose radius is measured in miles, instead of light centuries and returns. There was no sound, no slightest vibration, only Torlos' iron bones felt a slight shock as the inconceivable currents flowed into the gigantic space distortion coil from the storage fields, their shielded magnetic flux leaking by in some slight degree.  For ten seconds that seemed minutes Arcot held the ship on the course under the maximum combined powers of space distortion and time field distortion. Then he released both simultaneously.  The velvet black of space was about them as before, but now the disc of the Nebula was tiny behind them! So tiny was it, that these men, who knew its magnitude, gasped in sudden wonder. None of them had been able to conceive of such a velocity as this ship had shown! In seconds, Morey announced a moment later, they had traveled _one million, one hundred thousand light years_! Their velocity was six hundred and sixty quadrillion miles per second!  "Then it will take us only a little over one thousand seconds to travel the hundred and fifty million light years, at 110,000 light years per second--that's about the radius of our galaxy, isn't it!" exclaimed Wade.  They started on now, and one thousand and ten seconds, or a little more than eighteen minutes later, they stopped again. So far behind them now as to be almost lost in the far scattered universes, lay their own Island, and carefully they photographed the Universe that now lay less than twenty million light years ahead. Still, it was further, even after crossing this enormous gulf, than are many of those nebulae we see from Earth, many of which lie within that distance. They must proceed cautiously now, for they did not know the exact distance to the Nebula. Carefully, running forward in jumps of five million light years, forty-five second drives, they worked nearer.  Then finally they entered the Island, and drove toward the denser center.  "Good Lord, Arcot, look at those suns!" exclaimed Morey in amazement. For the first time they were seeing the suns of this system at a range that permitted observation, and Arcot had stopped to observe. The first one they had chosen had been a blue-white giant of enormous mass, nearly one hundred and fifty times as heavy as our own sun, and all the enormous surface was radiating power into space at a rate of nearly thirty thousand horsepower per square inch! No planets circled it, however, in its journey through space.  "I've been noticing the number of giants here. Look around."  The _Thought_ moved on, on to other suns. They must find one that was inhabited.  They stopped at last near a great orange giant, and examined it. It had indeed planets, and as Arcot watched, he saw in the telectroscope a line of gigantic freighters rise from the world, and whisk off to nothingness as they exceeded the speed of light! Instantly he started the _Thought_ searching in time fields for the freighters. He found them, and followed them as they raced across the void. He knew he was visible to them, and as he suspected, they soon stopped, slowing down and signaling to him.  "Morey--take the _Thought_. I'm going to visit them in the _Banderlog_ as I think we shall name the tender," called Arcot, stripping off the headset, and leaving the control seat. The other fleet of ships was now less than a hundred thousand miles away, clearly visible in the telectroscope. They were still signaling, and Arcot had set an automatic signaling device flashing an enormously powerful searchlight toward them in a succession of dots and dashes, an obvious signal, though also, obviously unintelligible to those others.  "Is it safe, Arcot?" asked Torlos anxiously. To approach those enormous ships in the relatively tiny _Banderlog_ seemed unwise.  "Far safer than they'll believe. Remember, only the _Thought_ could stand up against such weapons as even the _Banderlog_ carries, run as they are by cosmic energy," replied Arcot, diving down toward the little tender.  In a moment it was out through the lock, and sped away from them like a bullet, reaching the distant stranger fleet in less than ten seconds.  "They are communicating by thought!" announced Zezdon Afthen presently. "But I cannot understand them, for the impulses are too weak to be intelligently received."  For nearly an hour the _Banderlog_ hung beside the fleet, then it turned about, and raced once more to the _Thought_. Inside the lock, and a moment later Arcot appeared again on the threshold of the door. He looked immensely relieved.  "Well, I have some good news," he said and smiled, sitting down. "Follow that bunch, Morey, and I'll tell you about it. Set it and she'll hold nicely. We have a long way to go, and those are slow freighters, accompanied by one Cruiser.  "Those men," he began, "are men of Venone. You remember Thett's records said something of the Mighty Warless Ones of Venone? Those are they. They inhabit most of this universe, leaving the Thessians but four planets of a minor sun, way off in one corner. It seems the Thessians are their undesirable exiles, those who have, from generation to generation, been either forced to go there, or who wanted to go there.  "They did not like the easier and more effective method of disposing of undesirables, the instantaneous death chamber they now use. Thett was their prison world. No one ever returned and his family could go with him if they desired, but if they did not, they were carefully watched for outcroppings of undesirable traits--murder, crime of any sort, any habitual tendency to injustice.  "About six hundred years ago of our time, Thett revolted. There were scientists there, and their scientists had discovered a thing that they had been seeking for generations--the Twin-ray. I don't know what it is, and the Venonians don't either. It is the ray that destroys relux and lux, however, and can be carried only on a machine the size of their forts, due to some limitations. Just what those limitations are the Venonians don't know. Other than that ray they had no new weapons.  "But it was enough. Their guard ships which had circled the worlds of the prison system, Antseck, were suddenly destroyed, so suddenly that Venone received no word of it till a consignment ship, bringing prisoners, discovered their absence. The consignment ship returned without landing. Thett was now independent. But they were bound to their system, for although they had the molecular ships, they had never been permitted to have time apparatus, nor to see it, nor was any one who knew its principles ever consigned there. The result was that they were as isolated as ever.  "This was for two centuries. Two centuries later it was worked out by one of their scientists, and the Warless Ones had a War of defense. Their small fleet of cruisers, designed for rescue work and for clearing space lanes of wrecks and asteroids, was destroyed instantly, their world was protected only by the ray screen, which the Thessians did not have, and by the fact that they could build more cruisers. In less than a year Thett was defeated, and beaten back to her world, though Venone could not overcome Thett, now, for around their planets they had so many forts projecting the deadly rays, that no ship could approach.  "Then Thett learned how to make the screen, and came again. Venone had planetoid stations, that projected molecular rays of an intensity I wonder at, with their system of projecting. It seems these people have force-power feeds that operate through space, by which an entire solar system can tie in for power, and they fed these stations in that way. Lord only knows what tubes they had, but the Thessians couldn't get the power to fight.  "They've been let alone since then, they did not know why. I told them what their dear friends had been doing in that time, and the Venonians were immensely surprised, and very evidently sorry. They begged my pardon for letting loose such a menace, quite sincerely feeling that it was their fault. They offered any help they could give, and I told them that a chart of this system would be of the greatest use. They are going now to Venone, and we are to go with them, and see what they have to offer. Also, they want a demonstration of this 'remarkable ship that can defeat whole fleets of Thessians, and destroy or make planets at will,'" concluded Arcot.  "I do not in the least blame them for wanting to see this ship in operation, Arcot, but they are, very evidently, a much older race than yours," said Torlos, his thoughts coming clear and sharp, as those of a man who has thought over what he says carefully. "Are you not running danger that their minds may be more powerful than yours, that this story they have told you is but a ruse to get this ship on their world where thousand, millions can concentrate their will against you and capture the ship by mind where they cannot capture it by force?"  "That," agreed Arcot, "is where 'the rub' comes in as an ancient poet of Earth put it. I don't know and I did not have a chance to see. Wherefore I am about to do some work. Let me have the controls, Morey, will you?"  Arcot made a new ship. It was made entirely, perforce, of cosmium, lux and relux, for those were the only forms of matter he could create in space permanently from energy. It was equipped with gravity drive, and time distortion speed apparatus, and his far better trained mind finished this smaller ship with his titanic tools in less than the two days that it took them to reach Venone. In the meantime, the Venonian cruiser had drawn close, and watched in amazement as the ship was fashioned from the energy of space, became a thing of glistening matter, materializing from the absolute void of space, and forming under titanic tools such as the commander could not visualize.  Now, this move was partly the reason for this construction, for while the Venonian was busy, absorbed in watching the miraculous construction, his mind was not shielded, and it was open for observation of two such wonderfully trained minds as those of Zezdon Afthen and Zezdon Inthel. With their instruments and wonderfully developed mind-science, aided at times by Morey's less skillful, but more powerful mind of his older race, and powerful too, both because of long concentration and training, and because of his individual inheritance, they examined the minds of many of the officers of the ship without their awareness.  As a final test, Arcot, having finished the ship, suggested that the Venonian officer and one of the men of his ship have a trial of mental powers.  Zezdon Afthen tried first, and between the two ships, racing along side by side at a speed unthinkable, the two men struggled with those forces of will.  Quickly Zezdon Afthen told Arcot what he had learned.  The sun of Venone was close, now, and Arcot prepared to use as he intended the little space machine he had made. Morey took it, and went away from the _Thought_ flying on its time field. The ship had been stocked with lead fuel for its matter-burning generators from the supply that had been brought on the _Thought_ for emergencies, and the air had come from the _Thought_'s great tanks. Morey was going to Venone ahead of the _Thought_ to scout--"to see many of the important men of Venone and find out from them what I can of the relationship between Venone and Thett."  Hours later Morey returned with a favorable report. He had seen many of the important men of Venone, and conversed with them mentally from the safety of his ship, where the specially installed gravity apparatus had protected him and the ship against the enormous gravity of this gigantic world. He did not describe Venone; he wanted them to see it as he had first seen it.  So the little ship, which had served its purpose now, was destroyed, nearly a light year from Venone, and left a crushed wreck when two plates of artificial matter had closed upon it, destroying the apparatus, lest some unwelcome finder use it. There was little about it, the gravity apparatus alone perhaps, that might have been of use to Thett, and Thett already had the ray--but why take needless risk?  Then once more they were racing toward Venone. Soon the giant star of which it was a planet loomed enormous. Then, at Morey's direction, they swung, and before them loomed a planet. Large as Thett, near a half million miles in diameter, its mass was very closely equal to that of our sun. Yet it was but the burned-out sweepings of the outermost photospheric layers of this giant sun, and the radioactive atoms that made a sun active were not here; it was a cold planet. But its density was far, far higher than that of our sun, for our sun is but slightly denser than ordinary sea water. This world was dense as copper, for with the deeper sweepings of the tidal strains that had formed it, more of the heavier atoms had gone into its making, and its core was denser than that of Earth.  About it swept two gigantic satellite Worlds, each larger than Jupiter, but satellites of a satellite here! And Venone itself was inhabited by countless millions, yet their low, green tile and metal cities were invisible in the aspect of rolling lands with tiny hillocks, dwarfed by gigantic bulbous trees that floated their enormous weight in the water-dense atmosphere.  Here, too, there were no seas, for the temperature was above the critical temperature of water, and only in the self-cooling bodies of these men and in the trees which similarly cooled themselves, could there be liquid.  The sun of the world was another of the giant red stars, close to three hundred and fifty times the mass of our sun. It was circled by but three giant planets. Its enormous disc was almost invisible from the surface of the world as the _Thought_ sank slowly through fifteen thousand miles of air, due to the screening effect on light passing through so much air. Earth could have rested on this planet and not extended beyond its atmosphere! Had Earth been situated at this planet's center, the Moon could have revolved about it, and would not have been beyond the planet's surface!  In silent wonder the terrestrians watched the titanic world as they sank, and their friends looked on amazed, comprehending even less of the significance of what they saw. Already within the titanic gravitational field, they could see that indescribable effects were being produced on them, and on the ship. Arcot alone could know the enormous gravitation, and his accelerometer told him now that he was subject to a gravitational acceleration of three thousand four hundred and eighty-seven feet per second, or almost exactly one hundred and nine times Earth's pull.  "The _Thought_ weighs one billion, two hundred and six million, five hundred thousand tons, with tender, on Earth. Here it weighs approximately one hundred and twenty-one billion tons," said Arcot softly.  "Can you set it down? It may crush under this load if the gravity drive isn't supporting it," asked Torlos anxiously.  "Eight inches cosmium, and everything else supported by cosmium. I made this thing to stand any conceivable strain. Watch--if the planet's surface will take the load," replied Arcot.  They were still sinking, and now a number of small marvelously streamlined ships were clustered around the slowly settling giant. In a few moments more people, hundreds, thousands of men were flying through the air up to the ship.  A cruiser had appeared, and was very evidently intent on leading them somewhere, and Arcot followed it as it streaked through the dense air. "No wonder they streamline," he muttered as he saw the enormous force it took to drive the gigantic ship through this air. The air pressure outside their ship now was so great, that the sheer crushing effect of the air pressure alone was enormous. The pressure was well over nine tons to the square inch, on the surface of that enormous ship!  They landed approximately fifty miles from a large city which was the capital. The land seemed absolutely level, and the horizon faded off in distance in an atmosphere absolutely clear. There was no dust in the air at their height of nearly three hundred feet, for dust was too heavy on this world. There were no clouds. The mountains of this enormous world were not large, could not be large, for their sheer weight would tear them down, but what mountains there were were jagged, tortured rock, exceedingly sharp in outline.  "No rain--no temperature change to break them down," said Wade looking at them. "The zone of fracture can't be deep here."  "What, Wade, is the zone of fracture?" asked Torles.  "Rock has weight. Any substance, no matter how brittle, will flow if sufficient pressure is brought to bear from all sides. A thing which can flow will not break or fracture. You can't imagine the pressure to which the rock three hundred feet down is subject to. There is the enormous mass of atmosphere, the tremendous mass of rock above, and all forced down by this gravitation. By the time you get down half a mile, the rock is under such an inconceivably great pressure that it will flow like mud. The rock there cannot break; it merely flows under pressure. Above, the rock can break, instead of flowing. That is the zone of fracture. On Earth the zone of fracture is ten miles deep. Here it must be of the order of only five hundred feet! And the planetary blocks that made a planet's surface float on the zone of flowage--they determine the zone of fracture."  The gigantic ship had been sinking, and now, suddenly it gave a very unexpected demonstration of Wade's words. It had landed, and Arcot shut off the power. There was a roaring, and the giant ship trembled, rocked, and rolled along a bit. Instantly Arcot drove it into the air.  "Whoa--can't do it. The ship will stand it, and won't bend under the load--but the planet won't. We caused a Venone-quake. One of those planetary blocks Wade was talking about slipped under the added strain."  Quickly Wade explained that all the planetary blocks were floating, truly floating, and in equilibrium just as a boat must be. The added load had been sufficiently great, so that, with an already extant overload on this particular planetary block, this "boat" had sunk a bit further into the flowage zone, till it was once more at rest and balanced.  "They wish us to come out that they may see us, strangers and friends from another Island," interrupted Zezdon Afthen.  "Tell them they'd have to scrape us up off the ground, if we attempted it. We come from a world where we weigh about as much as a pebble here," said Wade, grinning at the thought of terrestrians trying to walk on this world.  "Don't--tell them we'll be right out," said Arcot sharply. "All of us."  Morey and the others all stared at Arcot in amazement. It was utterly impossible!  But Zezdon Afthen did as Arcot had asked. Almost immediately, another Morey stepped out of the airlock wearing what was obviously a pressure suit. Behind him came another Wade, Torlos, Stel Felso Theu, and indeed all the members of their party save Arcot himself! The Galactians stared in wonder--then comprehended and laughed together. Arcot had sent artificial matter images of them all!  Their images stepped out, and the Venonian crowd which had collected, stared in wonder at the giants, looming twice their height above them.  "You see not us, but images of us. We cannot withstand your gravity nor your air pressure, save in the protection of our ship. But these images are true images of us."  For some time then they communicated, and finally Arcot agreed to give a demonstration of their power. At the suggestion of the cruiser commander who had seen the construction of a spaceship from the emptiness of space, Arcot rapidly constructed a small, very simple, molecular drive machine of pure cosmium, making it entirely from energy. It required but minutes, and the Venonians stared in wonder as Arcot's unbelievable tools created the machine before their eyes. The completed ship Arcot gave to an official of the city who had appeared. The Venonian looked at the thing skeptically, and half expecting it to vanish like the tools that made it, gingerly entered the port. Powered as it was by lead burning cosmic ray generators, the lead alone having been made by transmutation of natural matter, it was powerful, and speedy. The official entered it, and finding it still existing, tried it out. Much to his amazement it flew, and operated perfectly.  Nearly ten hours Arcot and his friends stayed at Venone, and before they left, the Venonians, for all their vast differences of structure, had proven themselves true, kindly honest men, and a race that our Alliance has since found every reason to respect and honor. Our commerce with them, though carried on under difficulties, is none the less a bond of genuine friendship.     Chapter XXIV  THETT PREPARES   Streaking through the void toward Thett was again a tiny scout ship. It carried but a single man, and with all the power of the machine he was darting toward distant Thett, at a speed insanely reckless, but he knew that he must maintain such a speed if his mission were to be successful.  Again a tiny ship entered Thett's far-flung atmosphere, and slowed to less than a light speed, and sent its signal call ahead. In moments the patrol ship, less than three hundred miles away, had reached it, and together they streaked through the dense air in a screaming dive toward Shatnsoma, the capital city. It was directly beneath, and it was not long before they had reached the great palace grounds, and settled on the upper roof. Then the scout leaped out of his tiny craft, and dove for the door. Flashing his credentials, he dove down, and into the first shielded room. Here precious seconds were wasted while a check was made of the credentials the man carried, then he was sent through to the Council Room. And he, too, stood on that exact spot where the other scout, but a few weeks before, had stood--and vanished. Waiting, it seemed, were four councilors and the new Sthanto, Thalt.  "What news, Scout?" asked the Sthanto.  "They have arrived in the Universe to Venone, and gone to the planet Venone. They were on the planet when I left. None of our scouts were able to approach the place, as there were innumerable Venonian watchers who would have recognized our deeper skin-color, and destroyed us. Two scouts were rayed, though the Galactians did not see this. Finally we captured two Venonians who had seen it, and attempted to force the information we needed from them. A young man and his chosen mate.  "The man would tell nothing, and we were hurried. So we turned to the girl. These accursed Venonians are courageous for all their pacifism. We were hurried, and yet it was long before we forced her to tell what we needed to know so vitally. She had been one of the notetakers for the Venonian government. We got most of their conversation, but she died of burns before she finished.  "The Galactians know nothing of the twin-ray beyond its action, and that it is an electro-magnetic phenomenon, though they have been able to distort it by using a sheet of pure energy. But their walls are impregnable to it, and their power of creating matter from the pure energy of space, as we saw from a distance, would enable them to easily defeat it, were it not that the twin-ray passes through matter without harming it. Any ray which will destroy matter of the natural electrical types, will be stopped.  "The girl was damnably clever, for she gave us only the things we already knew, and but few new facts; knowing that she would inevitably die soon, she talked--but it was empty talk. The one thing of import we have learned is that they burn no fuel, use no fuel of any sort but in some inconceivable manner get their energy from the radiations of the suns of space. This could not be great--but we know she told the truth, and we know their power is great. She told the truth, for we could determine when she lied, by mental action, of course.  "But more we could not learn. The man died without telling anything, merely cursing. He knew nothing anyway, as we already had determined," concluded the scout.  Silently the Sthanto sat in thought for some moments. Then he raised his head, and looked at the scout once more.  "You have done well. You secured some information of import, which was more than we had dared hope for. But you managed things poorly. The woman should not have died so soon. We can only guess.  "The radiation of the suns of space--hmmm--" Sthanto Thalt's brow wrinkled in thought. "The radiation of the _suns_ of space. Were his power derived from the sun near which he is operating, he would not have said _suns_. It was more than one?"  "It was, oh Sthanto," replied the scout positively.  "His power is unreasonable. I doubt that he gave the true explanation. It may well have been that he did not trust the Venonians. I would not, for all their warless ways. But surely the suns of space give very little power at any given point at random. Else space would not be cold.  "But go, Scout, and you will be assigned a position in the fleet. The Colonial fleet, the remains of it, have arrived, and the colonists been removed. They failed. We will use their ships. You will be assigned." The scout left, and was indeed assigned to a ship of the colonists. The incoming colonial transports had been met at the outposts of the system, and rayed out of existence at once--failures, and bringing danger at their heels. Besides--there was no room for them on Thett without Thessians being crowded uncomfortably.  As their battleships arrived they were conducted to one of the satellites, and each man was "fumigated," lest he bring disease to the mother planet. Men entered, men apparently emerged. But they were different men.  "It seems," said the Sthanto softly, after the scout had left, "that we will have little difficulty, for they are, we know, vulnerable to the triple ray. And if we can but once destroy their driving units they will be helpless on our world. I doubt that wild tale of their using no fuel. Even if that be true they will be helpless with their power apparatus destroyed, and--if we miss the first time, we can seek it out, or drive them off!  "All of which is dependent on the fact that they attack at a point where we have a triple ray station to meet them. There are but three of these, actually, but I have had dummy stations, apparently identical with our other real stations, set up in many places.  "This gibberish we hear of creating matter--it is impossible, and surely unsuitable as a weapon. Their misty wall--that may be a force plane, but I know of no such possibility. The artificial substance though--why should any one make it? It but consumes energy, and once made is no more dangerous than ordinary matter, save that there is the possibility of creating it in dangerous position. Remember, we have heard already of the mental suggestions planes--mere force planes--_plus_ a wonderfully developed power of suggestion. They do most of their damage by mental impression. Remember, we have heard already of the mental suggestions of horrible things that drove one fleet of the weak-minded colonists mad.  "And that, I think, we will use to protect ourselves. If we can, with the apparatus which you, my son, have developed, cause them to believe that all the other forts are equally dangerous, and that this one on Thett is the best point of attack--It will be easy. Can you do it?"  "I can, Oh Sthanto, if but a sufficient number of powerful minds may be brought to aid me," replied the youngest of the four councilmen.  "And you, Ranstud, are the stations ready?" asked the ruler.  "We are ready."     Chapter XXV  WITH GALAXIES IN THE BALANCE   The _Thought_ arose from Venone after long hours, and at Arcot's suggestion, they assumed an orbit about the world, at a distance of two million miles, and all on board slept, save Torlos, the tireless molecular motion machine of flesh and iron. He acted as guard, and as he had slept but four days before, he explained there was really no reason for him to sleep as yet.  But the terrestrians would feel the greatest strain of the coming encounter, especially Arcot and Morey, for Morey was to help by repairing any damage done, by working from the control board of the _Banderlog_. The little tender had sufficient power to take care of any damage that Thett might inflict, they felt sure.  For they had not learned of the triple ray.  It was hours later that, rested and refreshed, they started for Thett. Following the great space-chart that they had been given by the Venonians, a series of blocks of clear lux metal, with tiny points of slowly disintegrating lux, such as had been used to illuminate the letters of the _Thought_'s name representing suns, the colors and relative intensity being shown. Then there was a more manageable guide in the form of photographs, marked for route by constellations formations as well, which would be their actual guide.  At the maximum speed of the time apparatus, for thus they could better follow the constellations, the _Thought_ plunged along in the wake of the tiny scout ship that had already landed on Thett. And, hours later, they saw the giant red sun of Antseck, the star of Thett and its system.  "We're about there," said Arcot, a peculiar tenseness showing in his thoughts. "Shall we barge right in, or wait and investigate?"  "Well have to chance it. Where is their main fort here?"  "From the direction, I should say it was to the left and ahead of our position," replied Zezdon Afthen.  The ship moved ahead, while about it the tremendous Thessian battlefleet buzzed like flies, thousands of ships now, and more coming with each second.  In a few moments the titanic ship had crossed a great plain, and came to a region of bare, rocky hills several hundred feet high. Set in those hills, surrounded by them, was a huge sphere, resting on the ground. As though by magic the Thessian fleet cleared away from the _Thought_. The last one had not left, when Arcot shot a terrific cosmic ray toward the sphere. It was relux, and he knew it, but he knew what would happen when that cosmic ray hit it. The solometer flickered and steadied at three as that inconceivable ray flashed out.  Instantly there was a terrific explosion. The soil exploded into hydrogen atoms, and expanded under heat that lashed it to more than a million degrees in the tiniest fraction of a second. The terrific recoil of the ray-pressure was taken by all space, for it was generated in space itself, but the direct pressure struck the planet, and that titanic planet reeled! A tremendous fissure opened, and the section that had been struck by the ray smashed its way suddenly far into the planet, and a geyser of fluid rock rolled over it, twenty miles deep in that world. The relux sphere had been struck by the ray, and had turned it, with the result that it was pushed doubly hard. The enormously thick relux strained and dented, then shot down as a whole, into the incandescent rock.  For miles the vaporized rock was boiling off. Then the fort sent out a ray, and that ray blasted the rock that had flowed over it as Arcot's titanic ray snapped out. In moments the fort was at the surface again--and a molecular hit it. The molecular did not have the energy the cosmic had carried, but it was a single concentrated beam of destruction ten feet across. It struck the fort--and the fort recoiled under its energy. The marvelous new tubes that ran its ray screen flashed instantly to a temperature inconceivable, and, so long as the elements embedded in the infusible relux remained the metals they were, those tubes could not fail. But they were being lashed by the energy of half a sun. The tubes failed. The elements heated to that enormous temperature when elements cannot exist--and broke to other elements that did not resist. The relux flashed into blinding iridescence--  And from the fort came a beam of pure silvery light. It struck the _Thought_ just behind the bow, for the operator was aiming for the point where he knew the control room and pilot must be. But Arcot had designed the ship for mental control, which the enemy operator could not guess. The beam was a flat beam, perhaps an inch thick, but it fanned out to fifty feet width. And where it touched the _Thought_, there was a terrific explosion, and inconceivably violent energy lashed out as the cosmium instantaneously liberated its energy.  A hundred feet of the nose was torn off the ship, and the enormously dense air of Thett rushed in. But that beam had cut through the very edge of one of the ray projectors, or better, one of the ray feed apparatus. And the ray feed released it without control; it released all the energy it could suck in from space about it, as one single beam of cosmic energy, somewhat lower than the regular cosmics, and it flashed out in a beam as solid matter.  There was air about the ship, and the air instantly exploded into atoms of a different sort, threw off their electrons, and were raised to the temperature at which no atom can exist, and became protons and electrons. But so rapidly was that coil sucking energy from space that space tended to close in about it, and in enormous spurts the energy flooded out. It was directed almost straight up, and but one ship was caught in its beam. It was made of relux, but the relux was powdered under the inconceivable blow that countless quintillions of cosmic ray photons struck it. That ray was in fact, a solid mass of cosmium moving with the velocity of light. And it was headed for that satellite of Thett, which it would reach in a few hours time.  The _Thought_, due to the spatial strains of the wounded coil, was constantly rushing away to an almost infinite distance, as the ship approached that other space toward which the coil tended with its load, and rushing back, as the coil, reaching a spatial condition which supplied no energy, fell back. In a hundredth of a second it had reached equilibrium, and they were in a weirdly, terribly distorted space. But the triple-ray of the Thessians seemed to sheer off, and miss, no matter how it was directed. And it was painfully weak, for the coil sucked up the energy of whatsoever matter disintegrated in the neighborhood.  Then suddenly the performance was over. And they plunged into artificial space that was black and clean, and not a thing of wavering, struggling energies. Morey, from his control in the _Banderlog_, had succeeded in getting sufficient energy, by using his space distortion coils, to destroy the great projector mechanism. Instantly Arcot, now able to create the artificial space without the destruction of the coils by the struggling ray-feed coil, had thrown them to comparative safety.  Space writhed before they could so much as turn from the instruments. The Thessians had located their artificial space, and reached it with an attraction ray. They already had been withstanding the drain of the enormous fields of the giant planet and the giant sun; the attractive ray was an added strain. Arcot looked at his instruments, and with a grim smile set a single dial. The space about them became black again.  "Pulling our energy--merely let 'em pull. They're pulling on an ocean, not a lake this time. I don't think they'll drain those coils very quickly." He looked at his instruments. "Good for two and a half hours at this rate.  "Morey, you sure did your job then. I was helpless. The controls wouldn't answer, of course, with that titanic thing flopping its wings, so to speak. What are we going to do?"  Morey stood in the doorway, and from his pocket drew a cigarette, handed it to Arcot, another to each of the others who smoked, and lit them, and his own. "Smoke," he said, and puffed. "Smoke and think. From our last experience with a minor tragedy, it helps."  "But--this is no minor tragedy, they have burst open the wall of this invulnerable ship, destroyed one of those enormous coils, and can do it again," exclaimed Zezdon Afthen, exceedingly nervous, so nervous that the normal courage of the man was gone. His too-psychic breeding was against him as a warrior.  "Afthen," replied Stel Felso Theu calmly, "when our friends have smoked, and thought, the _Thought_ will be repaired perfectly, and it will be made invulnerable to that weapon."  "I hope so, Stel Felso Theu," smiled Arcot. He was feeling better already. "But do you know what that weapon is, Morey?"  "Got some readings on it with the _Banderlog_'s instruments, and I think I do. Twin-ray is right," replied Morey.  "Hm-hm--so I think. It's a super-photon. What they do is to use a field somewhat similar to the field we use in making cosmium, except that in theirs, instead of the photons lying side by side, they slide into one another, compounding. They evidently get three photons to go into one. Now, as we know, that size photon doesn't exist for the excellent reason that it can't in this space. Space closes in about it. Therefore they have a projected field to accompany it that tends to open out space--and they are using that, not the attractive ray, on us now. The result is that for a distance not too great, the triple-ray exists in normal space--then goes into another. Now the question is how can we stop it? I have an idea--have you any?"  "Yes, but my idea can't exist in this space either," grinned Morey.  "I think it can. If it's what I think, remember it will have a terrific electric field."  "It's what you think, then. Come on." Arcot and Morey went to the calculating room, while Wade took over the ship. But one of the ray-feeds had been destroyed, and they had three more in action, as well as their most important weapon, artificial matter. Wade threw on the time field, and started the emergency lead burner working to recharge the coils that the Thessians were constantly draining. Being in their own peculiar space, they could not draw energy from the stars, and Arcot didn't want to return to normal space to discharge them, unless necessary.  "How's the air pressure in the rest of the ship?" asked Wade.  "Triple normal," replied Morey. "The Thessian atmosphere leaked in and sent it up terrifically, but when we went into our own space, at the halfway point, a lot leaked out. But the ship is full of water now. It was a bit difficult coming up from the _Banderlog_, and I didn't want to breathe the air I wasn't sure of. But let's work."  They worked. For eight hours of the time they were now in they continued to work. The supply of lead metal gave out before the end of the fourth hour, and the coils were nearing the end of their resistance. It would soon be necessary for Arcot to return to normal space. So they stopped, their calculations very nearly complete. Throwing all the remaining energy into the coils, they a little more than held the space about them, and moved away from Thett at a speed of about twice that of light. For an hour more Arcot worked, while the ship plowed on. Then they were ready.  As Arcot took over the controls, space reeled once more, and they were alone, far from Thett. The suns of this space were flashing and glowing about them, and the unlimited energy of a universe was at Arcot's command. But all the remaining atmosphere in the ship had either gone instantaneously in the vacuum, or solidified as the chill of expansion froze it.  To the amazement of the extra-terrestrians, Arcot's first move was to create a titanic plane of artificial matter, and neatly bisect the _Thought_ at the middle! He had thrown all of the controls thus interrupted into neutral, and in the little more than half of the ship which contained the control cabin, was also the artificial matter control. It was busy now. With bewildering speed, with the speed of thought trained to construct, enormous masses of cosmium were appearing beside them in space as Arcot created them from pure energy. Cosmium, relux and some clear cosmium-like lux metal. Ordinary cosmium was reflective, and he wanted something with cosmium's strength, and the clearness of lux.  In seconds, under Arcot's flying thought manipulation, a great tube had been welded to the original hull, and the already gigantic ship lengthened by more than five hundred feet! Immediately great artificial matter tools gripped the broken nose-section, clamped it into place, and welded it with cosmium flowing under the inconceivable pressure till it was again a single great hull.  Then the Thessian fleet found them. The coils were charged now, and they could have escaped, but Arcot had to work. The Thessians were attacked with moleculars, cosmics, and a great twin-ray. Arcot could not use his magnet, for it had been among those things severed from the control. He had two ray feeds, and the artificial matter. There were nearly three thousand ships attacking him with a barrage of energy that was inconceivably great, but the cosmium walls merely turned it aside. It took Arcot less than ten seconds to wipe out that fleet of ships! He created a wall of artificial matter at twenty feet from the ship--and another at twenty thousand miles. It was thin, yet it was utterly impenetrable. He swept the two walls together, and forced them against each other until his instruments told him only free energy remained between them. Then he released the outer wall, and a terrific flood of energy swept out.  "I don't think we'll be attacked again," said Morey softly. They were not. Thett had only one other fleet, and had no intention of losing the powers of their generators at this time when they so badly needed them. The strange ship had retired for repairs--very well, they could attack again--and maybe--  Arcot was busy. In the great empty space that had been left, he installed a second collector coil as gigantic as the main artificial matter generator. Then he repaired the broken ray feed, and it, and the companion coil which, with it, had been in the severed nose section, were now in the same relative position to the new collector coil that they had had with relation to the artificial matter coil. Next Arcot built two more ray feeds. Now in the gigantic central power room there loomed two tremendous power collectors, and six smaller ray feed collectors.  His next work was to reconnect the severed connectors and controls. Then he began work on the really new apparatus. Nothing he had constructed so far was more than a duplicate of existing apparatus, and he had been able to do it almost instantly, from memory. Now he must vision something new to his experience, and something that was forced to exist in part in this space, and partly in another. He tried four times before the apparatus had been completed correctly, and the work occupied ten hours. But at last it was done. The _Thought_ was ready now for the battle.  "Got it right at last?" asked Wade. "I hope so."  "It's right--tried it a little. I don't think you noticed it. I'm going down now to give them a nice little dose," said Arcot grimly. His ship was repaired--but they had caused him plenty of trouble.  "How long have we been out here, their time?" asked Wade.  "About an hour and a half." The _Thought_ had been on the time field at all times save when the Thessian fleet attacked.  "I think, Earthman, that you are tired, and should rest, lest you make a tired thought and do great harm," suggested Zezdon Afthen.  "I want to finish it!" replied Arcot, sharply. He was tired.  In seconds the _Thought_ was once more over that fortified station in the mountains--and the triple-ray reached out--and suddenly, about the ship, was a wall of absolute, utter blackness. The triple-ray touched it, and exploded into coruscating, blinding energy. It could not penetrate it. More energy lashed at the wall of blackness as the operators within the sphere-fort turned in the energy of all the generators under their control. The ground about the fort was a great lake of dazzling lava as far as the eye could see, for the triple-ray was releasing its energy, and the wall of black was releasing an equal, and opposing energy!  "Stopped!" cried Arcot happily. "Now here is where we give them something to think about. The magnet and the heat!"  He turned the two enormous forces simultaneously on the point where he knew the fort was, though it was invisible behind the wall of black that protected him. From his side, the energy of the spot where all the system of Thett was throwing its forces, was invisible.  Then he released them. Instantly there was a terrific gout of light on that wall of blackness. The ship trembled, and space turned gray about them. The black wall dissolved into grayness in one spot, as a flood of energy beyond comprehension exploded from it. The enormously strong cosmium wall dented as the pressure of the escaping radiation struck it, and turned X-ray hot under the minute percentage it absorbed. The triple-ray bent away, and faded to black as the cosmic force playing about it, actually twisted space beyond all power of its mechanism to overcome. Then, in the tiniest fraction of a second it was over, and again there was blackness and only the brilliant, blinding blue of the cosmium wall testified to its enormous temperature, cooling now far more slowly through green to red.  "Lord--you're right, Zezdon Afthen. I'm going to sleep," called Arcot. And the ship was suddenly far, far away from Thett. Morey took over, and Arcot slept. First Morey straightened the uninjured wall and ironed out the dents.  "What, Morey, is the wall of Blackness?" asked Stel Felso Theu.  "It's solid matter. A thing that you never saw before. That wall of matter is made of a double layer of protons lying one against the other. It absorbs absolutely every and all radiation, and because it is solid matter, not tiny sprinklings of matter in empty space, as is the matter of even the densest star, it stops the triple-ray. That matter is nothing but protons; there are no electrons there, and the positive electrical field is inconceivably great, but it is artificial matter, and that electrical field exerts its strain not in pulling and electrifying other bodies, but in holding space open, in keeping it from closing in about that concentrated matter, just as it does about a single proton, except that here the entire field energy is so absorbed.  "Arcot was tired, and forgot. He turned his magnet and his heat against it. The heat fought the solid matter with the same energy that created it, and with an energy that had resources as great. The magnet curved space about it, and about us. The result was the terrific energy release you saw, and the hole in the wall. All Thett couldn't make any impression on it. One of the rays blasted a hole in it," said Morey with a laugh. For he, too, loved this mighty thing, the almost living ideas of his friend's brain.  "But it is as bad as the space defense. It works both ways. We can't send through it but neither can they. Any thing we use that attacks them, attacks it, and so destroys it--and it fights."  "We're worse off than ever!" said Morey gloomily.  "My friend, you, too, are tired. Sleep, sleep soundly, sleep till I call--sleep!" And Morey slept under Zezdon Afthen's will, till Torlos carried him gently to his room. Then Afthen let the sleep relax to a natural one. Wade decided he might as well follow under his own power, for now he knew he was tired, and could not overcome Zezdon Afthen, who was not.         *       *       *       *       *  On Thett, the fort was undestroyed, and now floating on its power units in a sea of blazing lava. Within, men were working quickly to install a second set of the new tubes in the molecular motion ray screen, and other men were transmitting the orders of the Sthanto who had come here as the place of actually greatest safety.  "Order all battleships to the nearest power-feed station, and command that all power available be transmitted to the station attacked. I believe it will be this one. There is no limit on the power transmission lines, and we need all possible power," he commanded his son, now in charge of all land and spatial forces.  "And Ranstud, what happened to that molecular ray screen?"  "I do not know. I cannot understand such power.  "But what most worries me is his wall of darkness," said Ranstud seriously.  "But he was forced to retire for all his wall of darkness, as you saw.  "He can maintain it but a short time, and it was full of holes when he fled."  "Old Sthanto is much too confident, I believe," said an assistant working at one of the great boards in the enemy's fort, to one of his friends. "And I think he has lost his science-knowledge. Any power-man could tell what happened. They tried to use their own big rays against us, and their screen stopped them from going out, just as it stopped ours on the way in. Ours had been working at it for seconds, and hadn't bothered them. Then for a bare instant their ray touched it--and they retired. That shield of blackness is absolutely new."  "They have many men on that ship of theirs," replied his friend, helping to lift the three hundred ton load of a vacuum tube into place, "for it is evident that they built new apparatus, and it is evident their ship was increased in size to contain it. Also the nose was repaired. They probably worked under a time field, for they accomplished an impossible amount of work in the period they were gone."  Ranstud had come up behind them, and overheard the later part of this conversation. "And what," he asked suddenly, "did your meters tell you when our ray opened his ship?"  "Councilor of Science-wisdom, they told us that our power diminished, and our generators gave off but little power when his power was exceedingly little, we still had much."  "Have you heard the myth of the source of his power, in the story that he gets it from all the stars of the Island?"  "We have, Great Councilor. And I for one believe it, for he sucked the power from our generators. So might he suck the power from the inconceivably greater generators of the Suns. I believe that we should treat with them, for if they be like the peace-loving fools of Venone, we might win a respite in which to learn their secret."  Ranstud walked away slowly. He agreed, in his heart, but he loved life too well to tell the Sthanto what to do, and he had no intention of sacrificing himself for the possible good of the race.  So they prepared for another attack of the _Thought_, and waited.     Chapter XXVI  MAN, CREATOR AND DESTROYER   "What we must find," said Arcot, between contented puffs, for he had slept well, and his breakfast had been good, "is some weapon which will attack them, but won't attack us. The question is, what is it? And I think, I think--I know." His eyes were dreamy, his thoughts so cryptically abbreviated that not even Morey could follow them.  "Fine--what is it?" asked Morey after vainly striving to deduce some sense from the formulas that were chasing through Arcot's thoughts. Here and there he recognized them: Einstein's energy formula, Planck's quantum formulas, Nitsu Thansi's electron interference formulas, Stebkowfski's proton interference, Williamson's electric field, and his own formulas appeared, and others so abbreviated he could not recognize them.  "Do you remember what Dad said about the way the Thessians made the giant forts out in space--hauled matter from the moon and transformed it to lux and relux. Remember, I said then I thought it might be a ray--but found it wasn't what I thought? I want to to use the ray I was thinking of. The only question in my mind is--what is going to happen to us when I use it?"  "What's the ray?"  "Why is it, Morey, that an electron falls through the different quantum energy levels, falls successively lower and lower till it reaches its 'lowest energy level,' and can radiate no more. Why can't it fill another step, and reach the proton? Why has it no more quanta to release? We know that electrons tend to fall always to lower energy level orbits. Why do they stop?"  "And," said Morey, his own eyes dreamily bright now, "what would happen if it did? If it fell all the way?"  "I cannot follow your thoughts, Earthmen, beyond a glimpse of an explosion. And it seems it is Thett that is exploding, and that Thett is exploding itself. Can you explain?" asked Stel Felso Theu.  "Perhaps--you know that electrons in their planetary orbits, so called, tend to fall away to orbits of lower energy, till they reach the lowest energy orbit, and remain fixed till more energy comes and is absorbed, driving them out again. Now we want to know why they don't fall lower, fall all the way? As a matter of fact, thanks to some work I did last year with disintegrating lead, we do know. And thanks to the absolute stability of artificial matter, we can handle such a condition.  "The thing we are interested in is this: Artificial matter has no tendency to radiate, its electrons have no tendency to fall into the proton, for the matter is created, and remains as it was created. But natural matter does have a tendency to let the electron fall into the proton. A force, the 'lowest energy wall,' over which no electron can jump, caused by the enormous space distorting of the proton's mass and electrical attraction, prevents it. What we want to do is to remove that force, iron it out. Requires inconceivable power to do so in a mass the size of Thett-but then--!  "And here's what will happen: Our wall of protonic material won't be affected by it in the least, because it has no tendency to collapse, as has normal matter, but Thett, beyond the wall, _has_ that tendency, and the ray will release the energy of every planetary electron on Thett, and every planetary electron will take with it the energy of one proton. And it will take about one one-hundred-millionth of a second. Thett will disappear in one instantaneous flash of radiation, radiation in the high cosmics!  "Here's the trouble: Thett represents a mass as great as our sun. And our sun can throw off energy at the present rate of one sol for a period of some ten million million years, three and a half million tons of matter a second for ten million years. If all of that went up in _one one-hundred-millionth of a second_, how many sols?" asked Morey.  "Too many, is all I can say. Even this ship couldn't maintain its walls of energy against that!" declared Stel Felso Theu, awed by the thought.  "But that same power would be backing this ship, and helping it to support its wall. We would operate from--half a million miles."  "We will. If we are destroyed--so is Thett, and all the worlds of Thett. Let that flood of energy get loose, and everything within a dozen light years will be destroyed. We will have to warn the Venonians, that their people on nearby worlds may escape in the time before the energy reaches them," said Arcot slowly.  The _Thought_ started toward one of the nearer suns, and as it went, Arcot and Morey were busy with the calculators. They finished their work, and started back from that world, having given their message of warning, with the artificial matter constructors. When they reached Thett, less than a quarter of an hour of Thessian time had passed. But, before they reached Thett, Arcot's viewplates were blinded for an instant as a terrific flood of energy struck the artificial matter protectors, and caused them to flame into defense. Thett's satellite was sending its message of instantaneous destruction. That terrific ray had reached it, touched it, and left it a shattered, glowing ball of hydrogen.  "There won't be even that left when we get through with Thett!" said Arcot grimly. The apparatus was finished, and once more they were over the now fiery-red lava sea that had been mountains. The fort was still in action. Arcot had cut a sheet of sheer energy now, and as the triple-ray struck it, he knew what would happen. It did. The triple-ray shunted off at an angle of forty-five degrees in the energy field, and spread instantly to a diffused beam of blackness. Arcot's molecular reached out. The lava was instantly black, and mountains of ice were forming over the struggling defenses of the fort. The molecular screen was working.  "I'd like to know how they make tubes that'll stand that, Morey," said Arcot, pointing to an instrument that read .01 millisols. "They have tubes now, that would have wiped us out in minutes, seconds before this."  The triple-ray snapped off. They were realigning it to hit the ship now, correcting for the shield. Arcot threw out his protonic shield, and retreated to half a million miles, as he had said.  "Here goes." But before even his thoughts could send Theft to radiation, the entire side of the planet blazed suddenly incandescent. Thett was learning what had happened when their ray had wounded the _Thought_.  And then, in the barest instant of time, there was no Thett. There was an instant of intolerable radiation, then momentary blackness, and then the stars were shining where Thett had been. Thett was utterly gone.  But Arcot did not see this. About him there was a tremendous roar, titanic generator-converters that had not so much as hummed under the impact of Thett's greatest weapons, whined and shuddered now. The two enormous generators, the blackness of the protonic shield, and the great artificial matter generator, throwing an inner shield impervious to the cosmics Thett gave off as it vanished, both were whining. And the six smaller machines, which Arcot had succeeded in interconnecting with the protonic generator, were whining too. Space was weirdly distorted, glowing gray about them, the great generators struggling to maintain the various walls of protecting power against the surge of energy as Thett, a world of matter, disintegrated.  But the Very energy that fought to destroy those walls was absorbed in defending it, and by that much the attacking energy was lessened. Still, it seemed hours, days that the battle of forces continued.  Then it was over, and the skies were clear once more as Arcot lowered the protonic screen silently. The white sky of Thett was gone, and only the black starriness of space remained.  "_It's gone!_" gasped Torlos. He had been expecting it--still, the disappearance of a world--  "We will have to do no more. No ships had time to escape, and the risk we run is too great," said Morey slowly. "The escaping energy from that world will destroy the others of this system as completely, and it will probably cause the sun itself to blow up--perhaps to form new planets, and so the process repeats itself. But Venone knows better now, and their criminals will not populate more worlds.  "And we can go--home. To our little dust specks."  "But they're wonderfully welcome dust specks, and utterly important to us, Earthman," reminded Zezdon Afthen.  "Let us go then," said Arcot.         *       *       *       *       *  It was dusk, and the rose tints of the recently-set sun still hung on the clouds that floated like white bits of cotton in the darkening blue sky. The dark waters of the little lake, and the shadowy tree-clad hills seemed very beautiful. And there was a little group of buildings down there, and a broad cleared field. On the field rested a shining, slim shape, seventy-five feet long, ten feet in diameter.  But all, the lake, the mountains even, were dwarfed by the silent, glistening ruby of a gigantic machine that settled very, very slowly, and very, very gently downward. It touched the rippled surface of the lake with scarcely a splash, then hung, a quarter submerged in that lake.  Lights were showing in the few windows the huge bulk had, and lights showed now in the buildings on the shore. Through an open door light was streaming, casting silhouettes of two men. And now a tiny door opened in the enormous bulk that occupied the lake, and from it came five figures, that floated up, and away, and toward the cottage.  "Hello, Son. You have been gone long," said Arcot, senior, gravely, as his son landed lightly before him.  "I thought so. Earth has moved in her orbit. More than six months?"  His father smiled a bit wryly. "Yes. Two years and three months. You got caught in another time field and thrown the other way this time?"  "Time and force. Do you know the story yet?"  "Part of it--Venone sent a ship to us within a month of the time you left, and said that all Thett's system had disappeared save for one tremendous gas cloud--mostly hydrogen. Their ships were met by such a blast of cosmic rays as they came toward Thett that the radiation pressure made it almost impossible to advance. There were two distinct waves. One was rather slighter, and was more in the gamma range, so they suspected that two bodies had been directly destroyed; one small one, and one large one were reduced completely to cosmics. Your warning to Sentfenn was taken seriously, and they have vacated all planets near. It was the force field created when you destroyed Thett that threw you forward? Where are the others?"  "Zezdon Afthen and Zezdon Inthel we took home, and dropped in their power suits, without landing. Stel Felso Theu as well. We will visit them later."  "Have you eaten? Then let us eat, and after supper we'll tell you what little there is to tell."  "But Arcot," said Morey slowly, "I understand that Dad will be here soon, so let us wait. And I have something of which I have not spoken to you as yet. Worked it out and made it on the back trip. Installed in the _Thought_ with the _Banderlog_'s controls. It is--well, will you look?--Fuller! Come and see the new toy you designers are going to have to work on!"  They had all been depressed by the thought of their long absence, by the scenes of destruction they had witnessed so recently. They were beginning to feel better.  "Watch." Morey's thoughts concentrated. The _Thought_ outside had been left on locked controls, but the apparatus Morey had installed responded to his thoughts from this distance.  Before them in the room appeared a cube that was obviously copper. It stayed there but a moment, beaming brightly, then there was a snapping of energies about them--and it dropped to the floor and rang with the impact!  "It was not created from the air," said Morey simply.  "And now," said Arcot, looking at it, "Man can do what never before was possible. From the nothingness of Space he can make anything.  "Man alone in this space is Creator and Destroyer.  "It is a high place.  "May he henceforth live up to it."  And he looked out toward the mighty starlit hull that had destroyed a solar system--and could create another.I  Thirty minutes to Litchfield.  Conn Maxwell, at the armor-glass front of the observation deck, watched the landscape rush out of the horizon and vanish beneath the ship, ten thousand feet down. He thought he knew how an hourglass must feel with the sand slowly draining out.  It had been six months to Litchfield when the _Mizar_ lifted out of La Plata Spaceport and he watched Terra dwindle away. It had been two months to Litchfield when he boarded the _City of Asgard_ at the port of the same name on Odin. It had been two hours to Litchfield when the _Countess Dorothy_ rose from the airship dock at Storisende. He had had all that time, and now it was gone, and he was still unprepared for what he must face at home.  Thirty minutes to Litchfield.  The words echoed in his mind as though he had spoken them aloud, and then, realizing that he never addressed himself as sir, he turned. It was the first mate.  He had a clipboard in his hand, and he was wearing a Terran Federation Space Navy uniform of forty years, or about a dozen regulation-changes, ago. Once Conn had taken that sort of thing for granted. Now it was obtruding upon him everywhere.  "Thirty minutes to Litchfield, sir," the first officer repeated, and gave him the clipboard to check the luggage list. Valises, two; trunks, two; microbook case, one. The last item fanned a small flicker of anger, not at any person, not even at himself, but at the whole infernal situation. He nodded.  "That's everything. Not many passengers left aboard, are there?"  "You're the only one, first class, sir. About forty farm laborers on the lower deck." He dismissed them as mere cargo. "Litchfield's the end of the run."  "I know. I was born there."  The mate looked again at his name on the list and grinned.  "Sure; you're Rodney Maxwell's son. Your father's been giving us a lot of freight lately. I guess I don't have to tell you about Litchfield."  "Maybe you do. I've been away for six years. Tell me, are they having labor trouble now?"  "Labor trouble?" The mate was surprised. "You mean with the farm-tramps? Ten of them for every job, if you call that trouble."  "Well, I noticed you have steel gratings over the gangway heads to the lower deck, and all your crewmen are armed. Not just pistols, either."  "Oh. That's on account of pirates."  "Pirates?" Conn echoed.  "Well, I guess you'd call them that. A gang'll come aboard, dressed like farm-tramps; they'll have tommy guns and sawed-off shotguns in their bindles. When the ship's airborne and out of reach of help, they'll break out their guns and take her. Usually kill all the crew and passengers. They don't like to leave live witnesses," the mate said. "You heard about the _Harriet Barne_, didn't you?"  She was Transcontinent & Overseas, the biggest contragravity ship on the planet.  "They didn't pirate her, did they?"  The mate nodded. "Six months ago; Blackie Perales' gang. There was just a tag end of a radio call, that ended in a shot. Time the Air Patrol got to her estimated position it was too late. Nobody's ever seen ship, officers, crew or passengers since."  "Well, great Ghu; isn't the Government doing anything about it?"  "Sure. They offered a big reward for the pirates, dead or alive. And there hasn't been a single case of piracy inside the city limits of Storisende," he added solemnly.  The Calder Range had grown to a sharp blue line on the horizon ahead, and he could see the late afternoon sun on granite peaks. Below, the fields were bare and brown, and the woods were autumn-tinted. They had been green with new foliage when he had last seen them, and the wine-melon fields had been in pink blossom. Must have gotten the crop in early, on this side of the mountains. Maybe they were still harvesting, over in the Gordon Valley. Or maybe this gang below was going to the wine-pressing. Now that he thought of it, he'd seen a lot of cask staves going aboard at Storisende.  Yet there seemed to be less land under cultivation now than six years ago. He could see squares of bracken and low brush that had been melon fields recently, among the new forests that had grown up in the past forty years. The few stands of original timber towered above the second growth like hills; those trees had been there when the planet had been colonized.  That had been two hundred years ago, at the beginning of the Seventh Century, Atomic Era. The name "Poictesme" told that--Surromanticist Movement, when they were rediscovering James Branch Cabell. Old Genji Gartner, the scholarly and half-piratical space-rover whose ship had been the first to enter the Trisystem, had been devoted to the romantic writers of the Pre-Atomic Era. He had named all the planets of the Alpha System from the books of Cabell, and those of Beta from Spenser's _Faerie Queene_, and those of Gamma from Rabelais. Of course, the camp village at his first landing site on this one had been called Storisende.  Thirty years later, Genji Gartner had died there, after seeing Storisende grow to a metropolis and Poictesme become a Member Republic in the Terran Federation. The other planets were uninhabitable except in airtight dome cities, but they were rich in minerals. Companies had been formed to exploit them. No food could be produced on any of them except by carniculture and hydroponic farming, and it had been cheaper to produce it naturally on Poictesme. So Poictesme had concentrated on agriculture and had prospered. At least, for about a century.  Other colonial planets were developing their own industries; the manufactured goods the Gartner Trisystem produced could no longer find a profitable market. The mines and factories on Jurgen and Koshchei, on Britomart and Calidore, on Panurge and the moons of Pantagruel closed, and the factory workers went away. On Poictesme, the offices emptied, the farms contracted, forests reclaimed fields, and the wild game came back.  Coming toward the ship out of the east, now, was a vast desert of crumbling concrete--landing fields and parade grounds, empty barracks and toppling sheds, airship docks, stripped gun emplacements and missile-launching sites. These were more recent, and dated from Poictesme's second hectic prosperity, when the Gartner Trisystem had been the advance base for the Third Fleet-Army Force, during the System States War.  It had lasted twelve years. Millions of troops were stationed on or routed through Poictesme. The mines and factories reopened for war production. The Federation spent trillions on trillions of sols, piled up mountains of supplies and equipment, left the face of the world cluttered with installations. Then, without warning, the System States Alliance collapsed, the rebellion ended, and the scourge of peace fell on Poictesme.  The Federation armies departed. They took the clothes they stood in, their personal weapons, and a few souvenirs. Everything else was abandoned. Even the most expensive equipment had been worth less than the cost of removal.  The people who had grown richest out of the War had followed, taking their riches with them. For the next forty years, those who remained had been living on leavings. On Terra, Conn had told his friends that his father was a prospector, leaving them to interpret that as one who searched, say, for uranium. Rodney Maxwell found quite a bit of uranium, but he got it by taking apart the warheads of missiles.  Now he was looking down on the granite spines of the Calder Range; ahead the misty Gordon Valley sloped and widened to the north. Twenty minutes to Litchfield, now. He still didn't know what he was going to tell the people who would be waiting for him. No; he knew that; he just didn't know how. The ship swept on, ten miles a minute, tearing through thin puffs of cloud. Ten minutes. The Big Bend was glistening redly in the sunlit haze, but Litchfield was still hidden inside its curve. Six. Four. The _Countess Dorothy_ was losing speed and altitude. Now he could see it, first a blur and then distinctly. The Airlines Building, so thick as to look squat for all its height. The yellow block of the distilleries under their plume of steam. High Garden Terrace; the Mall.  Moment by moment, the stigmata of decay became more evident. Terraces empty or littered with rubbish; gardens untended and choked with wild growth; blank-staring windows, walls splotched with lichens. At first, he was horrified at what had happened to Litchfield in six years. Then he realized that the change had been in himself. He was seeing it with new eyes, as it really was.  The ship came in five hundred feet above the Mall, and he could see cracked pavements sprouting grass, statues askew on their pedestals, waterless fountains. At first he thought one of them was playing, but what he had taken for spray was dust blowing from the empty basin. There was a thing about dusty fountains, some poem he'd read at the University.  _The fountains are dusty in the Graveyard of Dreams; The hinges are rusty, they swing with tiny screams._  Was Poictesme a Graveyard of Dreams? No; Junkyard of Empire. The Terran Federation had impoverished a hundred planets, devastated a score, actually depopulated at least three, to keep the System States Alliance from seceding. It hadn't been a victory. It had only been a lesser defeat.  There was a crowd, almost a mob, on the dock; nearly everybody in topside Litchfield. He spotted old Colonel Zareff, with his white hair and plum-brown skin, and Tom Brangwyn, the town marshal, red-faced and bulking above everybody else. Kurt Fawzi, the mayor, well to the front. Then he saw his father and mother, and his sister Flora, and waved to them. They waved back, and then everybody was waving. The gangway-port opened, and the Academy band struck up, enthusiastically if inexpertly, as he descended to the dock.  His father was wearing a black suit with a long coat, cut to the same pattern as the one he had worn six years ago. Blackout curtain cloth. It was fairly new, but the coat had begun to acquire a permanent wrinkle across the right hip, over the pistol butt. His mother's dress was new, and so was Flora's, made for the occasion. He couldn't be sure just which of the Federation Armed Forces had provided the material, but his father's shirt was Med Service sterilon.  Ashamed to be noticing things like that, he clasped his father's hand, kissed his mother, embraced his sister. There were a few, but very few, gray threads in his father's mustache; a few more squint-wrinkles around the eyes. His mother's hair was all gray, now, and she was heavier. She seemed shorter, but that would be because he'd grown a few inches in the last six years. For a moment, he was surprised that Flora actually looked younger. Then he realized that to seventeen, twenty-three is practically middle age, but to twenty-three, twenty-nine is almost contemporary. He noticed the glint on her left hand and caught it to look at the ring.  "Hey! Zarathustra sunstone! Nice," he said. "Where is he, Sis?"  He'd never met her fiance; Wade Lucas hadn't come to Litchfield to practice medicine until the year after he'd gone to Terra.  "Oh, emergency," Flora said. "Obstetrical case; that won't wait on anything. In Tramptown, of course. But he'll be at the party.... Oops, I shouldn't have said that; that's supposed to be a surprise."  "Don't worry; I'll be surprised," he promised.  Then Kurt Fawzi was pushing forward, holding out his hand. Thinner, and grayer, but just as effusive as ever.  "Welcome home, Conn. Judge, shake hands with him and tell him how glad we all are to see him back.... Now, Franz, put away the recorder; save the interview for the _Chronicle_ till later. Ah, Professor Kellton; one pupil Litchfield Academy can be proud of!"  He shook hands with them: Judge Ledue, Franz Veltrin, old Professor Dolf Kellton. They were all happy; how much, he wondered, because he was Conn Maxwell, Rodney Maxwell's son, home from Terra, and how much because of what they hoped he'd tell them. Kurt Fawzi, edging him aside, was the first to speak of it.  "Conn, what did you find out?" he whispered. "Do you know where it is?"  He stammered, then saw Tom Brangwyn and Colonel Klem Zareff approaching, the older man tottering on a silver-headed cane and the younger keeping pace with him. Neither of them had been born on Poictesme. Tom Brangwyn had always been reticent about where he came from, but Hathor was a good guess. There had been political trouble on Hathor twenty years ago; the losers had had to get off-planet in a hurry to dodge firing squads. Klem Zareff never was reticent about his past. He came from Ashmodai, one of the System States planets, and he had commanded a regiment, and finally a division that had been blasted down to less than regimental strength, in the Alliance Army. He always wore a little rosette of System States black and green on his coat.  "Hello, boy," he croaked, extending a hand. "Good to see you again."  "It sure is, Conn," the town marshal agreed, then lowered his voice. "Find out anything definite?"  "We didn't have much time, Conn," Kurt Fawzi said, "but we've arranged a little celebration for you. We'll start it with a dinner at Senta's."  "You couldn't have done anything I'd have liked better, Mr. Fawzi. I'd have to have a meal at Senta's before I'd really feel at home."  "Well, it'll be a couple of hours. Suppose we all go up to my office, in the meantime. Give the ladies a chance to fix up for the party, and have a little drink and a talk together."  "You want to do that, Conn?" his father asked. There was an odd undernote of anxiety, or reluctance, in his voice.  "Yes, of course. I'd like that."  His father turned to speak to his mother and Flora. Kurt Fawzi was speaking to his wife, interrupting himself to shout instructions to some laborers who were bringing up a contragravity skid. Conn turned to Colonel Zareff.  "Good melon crop this year?" he asked.  The old Rebel cursed. "Gehenna of a big crop; we're up to our necks in melons. This time next year we'll be washing our feet in brandy."  "Hold onto it and age it; you ought to see what they charge for a drink of Poictesme brandy on Terra."  "This isn't Terra, and we aren't selling it by the drink," Colonel Zareff said. "We're selling it at Storisende Spaceport, for what the freighter captains pay us. You've been away too long, Conn. You've forgotten what it's like to live in a poor-house."  The cargo was coming off, now. Cask staves, and more cask staves. Zareff swore bitterly at the sight, and then they started toward the wide doors of the shipping floor, inside the Airlines Building. Outgoing cargo was beginning to come out; casks of brandy, of course, and a lot of boxes and crates, painted light blue and bearing the yellow trefoil of the Third Fleet-Army Force and the eight-pointed red star of Ordnance. Cases of rifles; square boxes of ammunition; crated auto-cannon. Conn turned to his father.  "This our stuff?" he asked. "Where did you dig it?"  Rodney Maxwell laughed. "You know the old Tenth Army Headquarters, over back of Snagtooth, in the Calders? Everybody knows that was cleaned out years ago. Well, always take a second look at these things everybody knows. Ten to one they're not so. It always bothered me that nobody found any underground attack-shelters. I took a second look, and sure enough, I found them, right underneath, mined out of the solid rock. Conn, you'd be surprised at what I found there."  "Where are you going to sell that stuff?" he asked, pointing at a passing skid. "There's enough combat equipment around now to outfit a private army for every man, woman and child in Poictesme."  "Storisende Spaceport. The freighter captains buy it, and sell it on some of the planets that were colonized right before the War and haven't gotten industrialized yet. I'm clearing about two hundred sols a ton on it."  The skid at which he had pointed was loaded with cases of M504 submachine guns. Even used, one was worth fifty sols. Allowing for packing weight, his father was selling those tommy guns for less than a good cafe on Terra got for one drink of Poictesme brandy.   II  He had been in Kurt Fawzi's office before, once or twice, with his father; he remembered it as a dim, quiet place of genteel conviviality and rambling conversation. None of the lights were bright, and the walls were almost invisible in the shadows. As they entered, Tom Brangwyn went to the long table and took off his belt and holster, laying it down. One by one, the others unbuckled their weapons and added them to the pile. Klem Zareff's cane went on the table with his pistol; there was a sword inside it.  That was something else he was seeing with new eyes. He hadn't started carrying a gun when he had left for Terra, and he was wondering, now, why any of them bothered to. Why, there wouldn't be a shooting a year in Litchfield, if you didn't count the Tramptowners, and they stayed south of the docks and off the top level.  Or perhaps that was just it. Litchfield was peaceful because everybody was prepared to keep it that way. It certainly wasn't because of anything the Planetary Government did to maintain order.  Now Brangwyn was setting out glasses, filling a pitcher from a keg in the corner of the room. The last time Conn had been here, they'd given him a glass of wine, and he'd felt very grown-up because they didn't water it for him.  "Well, gentlemen," Kurt Fawzi was saying, "let's have a toast to our returned friend and new associate. Conn, we're all anxious to hear what you've found out, but even if you didn't learn anything, we're still happy to have you back with us. Gentlemen; to our friend and neighbor. Welcome home, Conn!"  "Well, it's wonderful to be back, Mr. Fawzi," he began.  "Here, none of this mister foolishness; you're one of us, now, Conn. And drink up, everybody. We have plenty of brandy, if we don't have anything else."  "You can say that again, Kurt." That was one of the distillery people; he'd remember the name in a moment. "When this new crop gets pressed and fermented...."  "I don't know where in Gehenna I'm going to vat mine till it ferments," Klem Zareff said.  "Or why," another planter added. "Lorenzo, what are you going to be paying for wine?"  Lorenzo Menardes; that was the name. The distiller said he was worrying about what he'd be able to get for brandy.  "Oh, please," Fawzi interrupted. "Not today; not when our boy's home and is going to tell us how we can solve all our problems."  "Yes, Conn." That was Morgan Gatworth, the lawyer. "You did find out where Merlin is, didn't you?"  That set them all off. He was still holding his drink; he downed it in one gulp, barely tasting it, and handed the glass to Tom Brangwyn for a refill, and caught a frown on his father's face. One did not gulp drinks in Kurt Fawzi's office.  Well, neither did one blast everybody's hopes with half a dozen words, and that was what he was trying to force himself to do. He wanted to blurt out the one quick sentence and get it over with, but the words wouldn't come out of his throat. He lowered the second drink by half; the brandy was beginning to warm him and dissolve the cold lump in his stomach. Have to go easy, though. He wasn't used to this kind of drinking, and he wanted to stay sober enough to talk sense until he'd told them what he had to.  "I hope," he said, "that you don't expect me to show you the cross on the map, where the computer is buried."  All the eyes around him began to look troubled. Most of them had been expecting precisely that. His father was watching him anxiously.  "But it's still here on Poictesme, isn't it?" one of the melon planters asked. "They didn't take it away with them?"  "Most of you gentlemen," he said, "contributed to sending me to school on Terra, to study cybernetics and computer theory. It wouldn't do us any good to find Merlin if none of us could operate it. Well, I've done that. I can use any known type of computer, and train assistants. After I graduated, I was offered a junior instructorship to computer physics at the University."  "You didn't mention that, son," his father said.  "The letter would have come on the same ship I did. Besides, I didn't think it was very important."  "I think it is." There was a catch in old Dolf Kellton's voice. "One of my boys from the Academy offered a place on the faculty of the University of Montevideo, on Terra!" He finished his drink and held out his glass for more, something he almost never did.  "Conn means," Kurt Fawzi explained, "that it had nothing to do with Merlin."  All right; now tell them the truth.  "I was also to find out anything I could about a secret giant computer used during the War by the Third Fleet-Army Force, code-named Merlin. I went over all the records available to the public; I used your letter, Professor, and the head of our Modern History department secured me access to non-public material, some of it still classified. For one thing, I have locations and maps and plans of every Federation installation built here between 842 and 854, the whole period of the War." He turned to his father. "There are incredible things still undiscovered; most of the important installations were built in duplicate, sometimes triplicate, as a precaution against space attack. I know where all of them are."  "Space attack!" Klem Zareff was indignant. "There never was a time we could have attacked Poictesme. Even if we'd had the ships, we were fighting a purely defensive war. Aggression was no part of our policy--"  He interrupted: "Excuse me, Colonel. The point I was trying to make is that, with all I was able to learn, I could find nothing, not one single word, about any giant strategic planning computer called Merlin, or any Merlin Project."  There! He'd gotten that out. Now go on and tell them about the old man in the dome-house on Luna. The room was silent, except for the small insectile hum of the electric clock. Then somebody set a glass on the table, and it sounded like a hammer blow.  "Nothing, Conn?"  Kurt Fawzi was incredulous. Judge Ledue's hand shook as though palsied as he tried to relight his cigar. Dolf Kellton was looking at the drink in his hand as though he had no idea what it was. The others found their voices, one by one.  "Of course, it was the most closely guarded secret ..."  "But after forty years ..."  "Hah, don't tell me about security!" Colonel Zareff barked. "You should have seen the lengths our staff went to. I remember, once, on Mephistopheles ..."  "But there _was_ a computer code-named Merlin," Judge Ledue was insisting, to convince himself more than anybody else. "Its memory-bank contained all human knowledge. It was capable of scanning all its data instantaneously, and combining, and forming associations, and reasoning with absolute accuracy, and extrapolating to produce new facts, and predicting future events, and ..."  And if you'd asked such a computer, "Is there a God?" it would have simply answered, "Present."  "We'd have won the War, except for Merlin," Zareff was declaring.  "Conn, from what you've learned of computers generally, how big would Merlin have to be?" old Professor Kellton asked.  "Well, the astrophysics computer at the University occupied a volume of a hundred thousand cubic feet. For all Merlin was supposed to do, I'd say something of the order of three million to five million.  "Well, it's a cinch they didn't haul that away with them," Lester Dawes, the banker, said.  "Oh, lots of places on Poictesme where they could have hid a thing like that," Tom Brangwyn said. "You know, a planet's a mighty big place."  "It doesn't have to be on Poictesme, even," Morgan Gatworth pointed out. "It could be anywhere in the Trisystem."  "You know where I'd have put it?" Lorenzo Menardes asked. "On one of the moons of Pantagruel."  "But that's in the Gamma System, three light years away," Kurt Fawzi objected. "There isn't a hypership on this planet, and it would take half a lifetime to get there on normal-space drive."  Conn was lifting his glass to his lips. He set it down again and rose to his feet.  "Then," he said, "we will build a hypership. On Koshchei there are shipyards and hyperdrive engines and everything we will need. We only need one normal-space interplanetary ship to get out there, and we're in business."  "Well, I don't know we need one," Judge Ledue said. "That was only an idea of Lorenzo's. I think Merlin's right here on Poictesme."  "We don't know it is," Conn replied. "And we don't know we won't need a ship. Merlin may be on Koshchei; that's where the components would be fabricated, and the Armed Forces weren't hauling anything any farther than they had to. Koshchei's only two and a half minutes away by radio; that's practically in the next room. Look; here's how they could have done it."  He went on talking, about remote controls and radio transmission and positronic brains and neutrino-circuits. They believed it all, even the little they understood. They would believe anything he told them about Merlin--except the truth.  "But this will take money," Lester Dawes said. "And after that infernal deluge of unsecured paper currency thirty years ago ..."  "I have no doubt," Judge Ledue began, "that the Planetary Government at Storisende would give assistance. I have some slight influence with President Vyckhoven ..."  "Huh-_uh_!" That was one of Klem Zareff's fellow planters. "We don't want Jake Vyckhoven or any of this First-Families-of-Storisende oligarchy in this at all. That's the gang that bankrupted the Government with doles and work relief, and everybody else with worthless printing-press money after the War, and they've been squatting in a circle deploring things ever since. Some of these days Blackie Perales and his pirates'll sack Storisende, for all they'd be able to do to stop him."  "We get a ship out to Koshchei, and the next thing you know we'll be the Planetary Government," Tom Brangwyn said.  Rodney Maxwell finished the brandy in his glass and set it on the table, then went to the pile of belts and holsters and began rummaging for his own. Kurt Fawzi looked up in surprise.  "Rod, you're not leaving are you?" he asked.  "Yes. It's only half an hour till time for dinner, and I think Conn and I ought to have a little fresh air. Besides, you know, we haven't seen each other for six years." He buckled on the heavy automatic and settled the belt over his hips. "You didn't have a gun, did you, Conn?" he asked. "Well, let's go."   III  It wasn't until they were down to the main level and outside in the little plaza to the east of the Airlines Building that his father broke the silence.  "That was quite a talk you gave them, Conn. They believed every word of it. I even caught myself starting to believe it once or twice."  Conn stopped short; his father halted beside him. "Why didn't you tell them the truth, son?" Rodney Maxwell asked.  The question, which he had been throwing at himself, angered him. "Why didn't I just grab a couple of pistols and shoot the lot of them?" he retorted. "It wouldn't have killed them any deader, and it wouldn't have hurt as much."  "There is no Merlin. Is that it?"  He realized, suddenly, that his father had known, or suspected that all along. He started to say something, then checked himself and began again:  "There never was one. I was going to tell them, but you saw them. I couldn't."  "You're sure of it?"  "The whole thing's a myth. I'm quoting the one man in the Galaxy who ought to know. The man who commanded the Third Force here during the War."  "Foxx Travis!" His father's voice was soft with wonder. "I saw him once, when I was eight years old. I thought he'd died long ago. Why, he must be over a hundred."  "A hundred and twelve. He's living on Luna; low gravity's all that keeps him alive."  "And you talked to him?"  "Yes."  There'd been a girl in his third-year biophysics class; he'd found out that she was a great-granddaughter of Force General Travis. It had taken him until his senior midterm vacation to wangle an invitation to the dome-house on Luna. After that, it had been easy. As soon as Foxx Travis had learned that one of his great-granddaughter's guests was from Poictesme, he had insisted on talking to him.  "What did he tell you?"  The old man had been incredibly thin and frail. Under normal gravitation, his life would have gone out like a blown match. Even at one-sixth G, it had cost him effort to rise and greet the guest. There had been a younger man, a mere stripling of seventy-odd; he had been worried, and excused himself at once. Travis had laughed after he had gone out.  "Mike Shanlee; my aide-de-camp on Poictesme. Now he thinks he's my keeper. He'll have a squad of doctors and a platoon of nurses in here as soon as you're gone, so take your time. Now, tell me how things are on Poictesme...."  "Just about that," he told his father. "I finally mentioned Merlin, as an old legend people still talked about. I was ashamed to admit anybody really believed in it. He laughed, and said, 'Great Ghu, is that thing still around? Well, I suppose so; it was all through the Third Force during the War. Lord only knows how these rumors start among troops. We never contradicted it; it was good for morale.'"  They had started walking again, and were out on the Mall; the sky was flaming red and orange from high cirrus clouds in the sunset light. They stopped by a dry fountain, perhaps the one from which he had seen the dust blowing. Rodney Maxwell sat down on the edge of the basin and got out two cigars, handing one to Conn, who produced his lighter.  "Conn, they wouldn't have believed you _and_ Foxx Travis," he said. "Merlin's a religion with those people. Merlin's a robot god, something they can shove all their problems onto. As soon as they find Merlin, everybody will be rich and happy, the Government bonds will be redeemed at face value plus interest, the paper money'll be worth a hundred Federation centisols to the sol, and the leaves and wastepaper will be raked off the Mall, all by magic." He muttered an unprintability and laughed bitterly.  "I didn't know you were the village atheist, Father."  "In a religious community, the village atheist keeps his doubts to himself. I have to do business with these Merlinolators. It's all I can do to keep Flora from antagonizing them at school."  Flora was a teacher; now she was assistant principal of the grade schools. Professor Kellton was also school superintendent. He could see how that would be.  "Flora's not a True Believer, then?"  Rodney Maxwell shook his head. "That's largely Wade Lucas's influence, I'd say. You know about him."  Just from letters. Wade Lucas was from Baldur; he'd gone off-planet as soon as he'd gotten his M.D. Evidently the professional situation there was the same as on Terra; plenty of opportunities, and fifty competitors for each one. On Poictesme, there were few opportunities, but nobody competed for anything, not even to find Merlin.  "He'd never heard of Merlin till he came here, and when he did, he just couldn't believe in it. I don't blame him. I've heard about it all my life, and I can't."  "Why not?"  "To begin with, I suppose, because it's just another of these things everybody believes. Then, I've had to do some studying on the Third Force occupation of Poictesme to know where to go and dig, and I never found any official, or even reliably unofficial, mention of anything of the sort. Forty years is a long time to keep a secret, you know. And I can't see why they didn't come back for it after the pressure to get the troops home was off, or why they didn't build a dozen Merlins. This isn't the only planet that has problems they can't solve for themselves."  "What's Mother's attitude on Merlin?"  "She's against it. She thinks it isn't right to make machines that are smarter than people."  "I'll agree. It's scientifically impossible."  "That's what I've been trying to tell her. Conn, I noticed that after Kurt Fawzi started talking about how long it would take to get to the Gamma System, you jumped right into it and began talking up a ship. Did you think that if you got them started on that it would take their minds off Merlin?"  "That gang up in Fawzi's office? Nifflheim, no! They'll go on hunting Merlin till they die. But I was serious about the ship. An idea hit me. You gave it to me; you and Klem Zareff."  "Why, I didn't say a word ..."  "Down on the shipping floor, before we went up. You were talking about selling arms and ammunition at a profit of two hundred sols a ton, and Klem was talking as though a bumper crop was worse than a Green Death epidemic. If we had a hypership, look what we could do. How much do you think a settler on Hoth or Malebolge or Irminsul would pay for a good rifle and a thousand rounds? How much would he pay for his life?--that's what it would come to. And do you know what a fifteen-cc liqueur glass of Poictesme brandy sells for on Terra? One sol; Federation money. I'll admit it costs like Nifflheim to run a hypership, but look at the difference between what these tramp freighter captains pay at Storisende and what they get."  "I've been looking at it for a long time. Maybe if we had a few ships of our own, these planters would be breaking new ground instead of cutting their plantings, and maybe we'd get some money on this planet that was worth something. You have a good idea there, son. But maybe there's an angle to it you haven't thought of."  Conn puffed slowly at the cigar. Why couldn't they grow tobacco like this on Terra? Soil chemicals, he supposed; that wasn't his subject.  "You can't put this scheme over on its own merits. This gang wouldn't lift a finger to build a hypership. They've completely lost hope in everything but Merlin."  "Well, can do. I'll even convince them that Merlin's a space-station, in orbit off Koshchei. I think I could do that."  "You know what it'll cost? If you go ahead with it, I'm in it with you, make no mistake about that. But you and I will be the only two people on Poictesme who can be trusted with the truth. We'll have to lie to everybody else, with every word we speak. We'll have to lie to Flora, and we'll have to lie to your mother. Your mother most of all. She believes in absolutes. Lying is absolutely wrong, no matter whom it helps; telling the truth is absolutely right, no matter how much damage it does or how many hearts it breaks. You think this is going to be worth a price like that?"  "Don't you?" he demanded, and then pointed along the crumbling and littered Mall. "Look at that. Pretend you never saw it before and are looking at it for the first time. And then tell me whether it'll be worth it or not."  His father took a cigar from his mouth. For a moment, he sat staring silently.  "Great Ghu!" Rodney Maxwell turned. "I wonder how that sneaked up on me; I honestly never realized.... Yes, Conn. This is a cause worth lying for." He looked at his watch. "We ought to be starting for Senta's, but let's take a few minutes and talk this over. How are you going to get it started?"  "Well, convince them that I can find Merlin and that they can't find it without me. I think I've done that already. Then convince them that we'll have to have a ship to get to Koshchei, and--"  "Won't do. That'll take money, and money's something none of this gang has."  "You heard me talk about the stuff I found out on Terra? Father, you have no idea what all there is. You remember the old Force Command Headquarters, the one the Planetary Government took over? I know where there's a duplicate of that, completely underground. It has everything the other one had, and a lot more, because it'll be cram-full of supplies to be used in case of a general blitz that would knock out everything on the planet. And a chain of hospitals. And a spaceport, over on Barathrum, that was built inside the crater of an extinct volcano. There won't be any hyperships there of course, but there'll be equipment and material. We might be able to build a ship there. And supply depots, all over the planet; none of them has ever been opened since the War. Don't worry about financing; we have that."  His father, he could see, appreciated what he had brought home from Terra. He was nodding, with quick head jerks, at each item.  "That'll do it, all right. Now, listen; what we want to do is get a company organized, a regular limited-liability company, with a charter. We'll contribute the information you brought back from Terra, and we'll get the rest of this gang to put all the money we can twist out of them into it, so we'll be sure they won't say, 'Aw, Nifflheim with it!' and walk out on us as soon as the going gets a little tough." Rodney Maxwell got to his feet, hitching his gun-belt. "I'll pass the word to Kurt to get a meeting set up for tomorrow afternoon."  "What'll we call this company? Merlin Rediscovery, Ltd?"  "No! We keep Merlin out of it. As far as the public is supposed to know, this is just a war-material prospecting company. I'll impress on them that Merlin is to be kept a secret. That way, we'll have to engage in regular prospecting and salvage work as a front. I'll see to it that the front is also the main objective." He nodded down the Mall, toward the sunset, which was blazing even higher and redder. "Well, let's go. You don't want to be late for your own welcome-home party."  They walked slowly, still talking, until they came to the end of the Mall. The escalators to the level below weren't working. Now that he thought of it, they hadn't been when he had gone away, six years ago, but he could remember riding up and down on them as a small child. For a moment they stood in the sunset light, looking down on the lower terrace as they finished their cigars.  Senta's was mostly outdoors, the tables under the open sky. The people gathered below were looking at the sunset, too; Litchfielders loved to watch sunsets, maybe because a sunset was one of the few things economic conditions couldn't affect. There was Kurt Fawzi, the center of a group to whom he was declaiming earnestly; there was his mother, and Flora, and Flora's fiance, who was the uncomfortable lone man in an excited feminine flock. And there was Senta herself, short and dumpy, in one of her preposterous red and purple dresses, bubbling happily one moment and screaming invective at some laggard waiter the next.  They threw away their cigars and started down the long, motionless escalator. Conn Maxwell, Hero of the Hour, marching to Destiny. He seemed to hear trumpets sounding before him.  And an occasional muted Bronx cheer.   IV  The alarm chimed softly beside his bed; he reached out and silenced it, and lay looking at the early sunlight in the windows, and found that he was wishing himself back in his dorm room at the University. No, back in this room, ten years ago, before any of this had started. For a while, he imagined himself thirteen years old and knowing everything he knew now, and he began mapping a campaign to establish himself as Litchfield's Juvenile Delinquent Number One, to the end that Kurt Fawzi and Dolf Kellton and the rest of them would never dream of sending him to school on Terra to find out where Merlin was.  But he couldn't even go back to yesterday afternoon in Kurt Fawzi's office and tell them the truth. All he could do was go ahead. It had seemed so easy, when he and his father had been talking on the Mall; just get a ship built, and get out to Koshchei, and open some of the shipyards and engine works there, and build a hypership. Sure; easy--once he got started.  He climbed out of bed, knuckled the sleep-sand out of his eyes, threw his robe around him, and started across the room to the bath cubicle.  They had decided to have breakfast together his first morning home. The party had broken up late, and then there had been the excitement of opening the presents he had brought back from Terra. Nobody had had a chance to talk about Merlin, or about what he was going to do, now that he was home. That, and his career of mendacity, would start at breakfast. He wanted to let his father get to the table first, to run interference for him; he took his time with his toilet and dressed carefully and slowly. Finally, he zipped up the short waist-length jacket and went out.  His father and mother and Flora were at the table, and the serving-robot was floating around a few inches off the floor, steam trailing from its coffee urn and its tray lid up to offer food. He greeted everybody and sat down at his place, and the robot came around to him. His mother had selected all the things he'd been most fond of six years ago: shovel-snout bacon, hotcakes, starberry jam, things he hadn't tasted since he had gone away. He filled his plate and poured a cup of coffee.  "You don't want to bother coming out to the dig with me this morning, do you?" his father was saying. "I'll be back here for lunch, and we'll go to the meeting in the afternoon."  "Meeting?" Flora asked. "What meeting?"  "Oh, we didn't have time to tell you," Rodney Maxwell said. "You know, Conn brought back a lot of information on locations of supply depots and things like that. An amazing list of things that haven't been discovered yet. It's going to be too much for us to handle alone; we're organizing a company to do it. We'll need a lot of labor, for one thing; jobs for some of these Tramptowners."  "That's going to be something awfully big," his mother said dubiously. "You never did anything like that before."  "I never had the kind of a partner I have now. It's Maxwell & Son, from now on."  "Who's going to be in this company?" Flora wanted to know.  "Oh, everybody around town; Kurt and the Judge and Klem, and Lester Dawes. All that crowd."  "The Fawzis' Office Gang," Flora said disparagingly. "I suppose they'll want Conn to take them right to where Merlin is, the first thing."  "Well, not the first thing," Conn said. "Merlin was one thing I couldn't find out anything about on Terra."  "I'll bet you couldn't!"  "The people at Armed Forces Records would let me look at everything else, and make microcopies and all, but not one word about computers. Forty years, and they still have the security lid welded shut on that."  Flora looked at him in shocked surprise. "You don't mean to tell me you believe in that thing?"  "Sure. How do you think they fought a war around a perimeter of close to a thousand light-years? They couldn't do all that out of their heads. They'd have to have computers, and the one they'd use to correlate everything and work out grand-strategy plans would have to be a dilly. Why, I'd give anything just to look at the operating panels for that thing."  "But that's just a silly story; there never was anything like Merlin. No wonder you couldn't find out about it. You were looking for something that doesn't exist, just like all these old cranks that sit around drinking brandy and mooning about what Merlin's going to do for them, and never doing anything for themselves."  "Oh, they're going to do something, now, Flora," his father told her. "When we get this company organized--"  "You'll dig up a lot of stuff you won't be able to sell, like that stuff you've been bringing in from Tenth Army, and then you'll go looping off chasing Merlin, like the rest of them. Well, maybe that'll be a little better than just sitting in Kurt Fawzi's office talking about it, but not much."  It kept on like that. Conn and his father tried several times to change the subject; each time Flora ignored the effort and returned to her diatribe. Finally, she put her plate and cup on the robot's tray and got to her feet.  "I have to go," she said. "Maybe I can do something to keep some of these children from growing up to be Merlin-worshipers like their parents."  She flung out of the room angrily. Mrs. Maxwell looked after her in distress.  "And I thought it was going to be so nice, having breakfast together again," she lamented.  Somehow the breakfast wasn't quite as good as he'd thought it was at first. He wondered how many more breakfasts like that he was going to have to sit through. He and his father finished quickly and got up, while his mother started the robot to clearing the table.  "Conn," she said, after his father had gone out, "you shouldn't have gotten Flora started like that."  "I didn't get Flora started; she's equipped with a self-starter. If she doesn't believe in Merlin, that's her business. A lot of these people do, and I'm going to help them hunt for it. That's why they all chipped in to send me to school on Terra; remember?"  "Yes, I know." Her voice was heavy with distress. "Conn, do you really believe there is a ... that thing?" she asked.  "Why, of course." He was mildly surprised at how sincerely and straightforwardly he said it. "I don't know where it is, but it's somewhere on Poictesme, or in the Alpha System."  "Well, do you think it would be a good thing to find it?"  That surprised him. Everybody knew it would be, and his mother didn't share his father's attitude about things everybody knew. She hadn't any business questioning a fundamental postulate like that.  "It frightens me," she continued. "I don't even like to think about it. A soulless intelligence; it seems evil to me."  "Well, of course it's soulless. It's a machine, isn't it? An aircar's soulless, but you're not afraid to ride in one."  "But this is different. A machine that can think. Conn, people weren't mean to make machines like that, wiser than they are."  "Now wait a minute, Mother. You're talking to a computerman now." Professional authority was something his mother oughtn't to question. "A computer like Merlin isn't intelligent, or wise, or anything of the sort. It doesn't think; the people who make computers and use them do the thinking. A computer's a tool, like a screwdriver; it has to have a man to use it."  "Well, but...."  "And please, don't talk about what people are _meant_ to do. People aren't _meant_ to do things; they _mean_ to do things, and nine times out of ten, they end by doing them. It may take a hundred thousand years from a Stone Age savage in a cave to the captain of a hyperspace ship, but sooner or later they get there."  His mother was silent. The soulless machine that had been clearing the table floated out of the room, the dishwasher in its rectangular belly gurgling. Maybe what he had told her was logical, but women aren't impressed by logic. She knew better--for the good old feminine reason, _Because_.  "Wade Lucas wanted me to drop in on him for a checkup," he mentioned. "That's rubbish; I had one for my landing pratique on the ship. He just wants to size up his future brother-in-law."  "Well, you ought to go see him."  "How did Flora come to meet him, anyhow?"  "Well, you know, he came from Baldur. He was in Storisende, looking for an opening to start a practice, and he heard about some medical equipment your father had found somewhere and came out to see if he could buy it. Your father and Judge Ledue and Mr. Fawzi talked him into opening his office here. Then he and Flora got acquainted...." She asked, anxiously: "What did you think of him, Conn?"  "Seems like a regular guy. I think I'll like him." A husband like Wade Lucas might be a good thing for Flora. "I'll drop in on him, sometime this morning."  His mother went toward the rear of the house--more soulless machines, like the housecleaning-robot, and the laundry-robot, to look after. He went into his father's office and found the cigar humidor, just where it had been when he'd stolen cigars out of it six years ago and thought his father never suspected what he was doing.  Now, why didn't they export this tobacco? It was better than anything they grew on Terra; well, at least it was different, just as Poictesme brandy was different from Terran bourbon or Baldur honey-rum. That was the sort of thing that could be sold in interstellar trade anytime and anywhere; the luxury goods that were unique. Staple foodstuffs, utility textiles, metal products, could be produced anywhere, and sooner or later they were. That was the reason for the original, pre-War depression: the customers were all producing for themselves. He'd talk that over with his father. He wished he'd had time to take some economics at the University.  He found the file his father kept up-to-date on salvage sites found and registered with the Claims Office in Storisende. Some of the locations he had brought back data for had been discovered, but, to his relief, not the underground duplicate Force Command Headquarters, and not the spaceport on the island continent of Barathrum, to the east. That was all right.  He went to the house-defense arms closet and found a 10-mm Navy pistol, and a belt and spare clips. Making sure that the pistol and magazines were loaded, he buckled it on. He debated getting a vehicle out of the hangar on the landing stage, decided against it, and started downtown on foot.  One of the first people he met was Len Yeniguchi, the tailor. He would be at the meeting that afternoon. He managed, while talking, to comment on the cut of Conn's suit, and finger the material.  "Ah, nice," he complimented. "Made on Terra? We don't see cloth like that here very often."  He meant it wasn't Armed Forces salvage.  "Father ought to be around to see you with a bolt of material, to have a suit made," he said. "For Ghu's sake, either talk him into having a short jacket like this, or get him to buy himself a shoulder holster. He's ruined every coat he ever owned, carrying a gun on his hip."  A little farther on, he came to a combat car grounded in the middle of the street. It was green, with black trimmings, and lettered in black, GORDON VALLEY HOME GUARD. Tom Brangwyn was standing beside it, talking to a young man in a green uniform.  "Hello, Conn." The town marshal looked at his hip and grinned. "See you got all your clothes on this morning. You were just plain indecent, yesterday.... You know Fred Karski, don't you?"  Yes, now that Tom mentioned it, he did. He and Fred had gone to school together at the Litchfield Academy. But the six years since they'd seen each other last had made a lot of difference in both of them. He was beginning to think that the only strangers in Litchfield were his own contemporaries. They shook hands, and Conn looked at the combat car and Fred Karski's uniform.  "What's going on?" he asked. "The System States Alliance to business again?"  Karski laughed. "Oh, that's the Colonel's idea. Green and black were his colors in the War, and he's in command of the regiment."  "Regiment? You need a whole regiment?" Conn asked.  "Well, it's two companies, each about the size of a regular army platoon, but we have to call it a regiment so he can keep his old Rebel Army rank."  "We could use a regiment, Conn," Tom Brangwyn said seriously. "You have no idea how bad things have gotten. Over on the east coast, the outlaws are looting whole towns. About four months ago, they sacked Waterville; burned the whole town and killed close to a hundred people. That was Blackie Perales' gang."  "Who is this Blackie Perales? I heard the name mentioned in connection with the _Harriet Barne_."  "Blackie Perales is anybody the Planetary Government can't catch, which means practically any outlaw," Fred Karski said.  "No, Fred; there is a Blackie Perales," Tom Brangwyn said. "He used to be a planter, down in the south. The banks foreclosed on him when he couldn't pay his notes, and he turned outlaw. That's the way it's going, all around. Every time a planter loses his plantation or a farmer loses his farm, or a mechanic loses his job, he turns outlaw. Take Tramptown, here. We used to plant nothing but melons. Then, when the sale for wine and brandy dropped, the melon-planters began cutting their melon crops and raising produce, instead of buying it from up north, and turning land into pasture for cattle. The people we used to buy foodstuffs from couldn't sell all they raised, and that threw a lot of farmhands out of work. So they got the idea there was work here, and they came flocking in, and when they couldn't get jobs, they just stayed in Tramptown, stealing anything they could. We don't even try to police Tramptown any more; we just see to it they don't come up here."  "Well, where do these outlaws and pirates who are looting whole towns come from?"  "Down in the Badlands, mostly. None of them have been bothering us, since we organized the Home Guard. They tried to, a couple of times, at first. There may have been a few survivors; they spread it around that Gordon Valley wasn't any outlaws' health resort."  "Why don't you join us, Conn?" Fred Karski asked. "All our old gang belong."  "I'd like to, but I'm afraid I'm going to be kind of busy."  Brangwyn nodded. "Yes. You will be, at that," he agreed.  "So I hear," Fred Karski said. "Do you really know where it is, Conn?"  "Well, no." He went into the routine about Merlin being still classified triple-top secret. "But we'll find it. It may take time, but we will."  They talked for a while. He asked more questions about the Home Guard. His father, it seemed, had donated all the equipment. They had a hundred and seventy men on the active list, but they had a reserve of over eight hundred, and combat vehicles and weapons on all the plantations and in all the towns along the river. The reserve had only been turned out twice; both times, outlaw attacks had been stopped dead--literally. The Home Guard, it appeared, was not given to making arrests or taking prisoners. Finally, he parted from them, strolling on along the row of stores and business places, many vacant, under the south edge of the Mall, until he saw a fluorolite sign, WADE LUCAS, M. D. He entered.  Lucas wasn't busy. They went into his consultation office, and Conn took off his gun-belt and hung it up; Lucas offered cigarettes, and they lighted and sat down.  "I see you've started carrying one," he said, nodding to the pistol Conn had laid aside.  "Civic obligation. I'm going to be too busy for Home Guard duty, but if I can protect myself, it'll save somebody else the job of protecting me."  "Maybe if there weren't so many guns around, there wouldn't be so much trouble."  He felt his good opinion of Wade Lucas start to slip. The Liberals on Terra had been full of that kind of talk, which was why only four out of ten of last year's graduating class at Armed Forces Academy had been able to get active commissions. The last war had been a disaster, so don't prepare for another one; when it comes, let it be a worse disaster.  "Guns don't make trouble; people make trouble. If the troublemakers are armed, you have to be armed too. When did you last see an Air Patrol boat around here, or even a Constabulary trooper? All we have here is the Home Guard and Tom Brangwyn and three deputies, and his pay and theirs is always six months in arrears."  Lucas nodded. "A bankrupt government, an unemployment rate that rises every year, currency that buys less every month. And do-it-yourself justice." The doctor blew a smoke ring and watched it float toward the ventilator-intake. "You said you're going to be busy. This company your father's talking about organizing?"  "That's right. You're going to be at the meeting at the Academy this afternoon, aren't you?"  "Yes. Just what are you going to do, after you get it organized?"  "Well, I brought back information on a great deal of undiscovered equipment and stores that the Third Force left behind...." He talked on for some time, keeping to safe generalities. "It's too big for my father and me to handle alone, even if we didn't feel morally obligated to take in the people who contributed toward sending me to school on Terra. You ought to be interested in it. I know of six fully supplied hospitals, intended to take care of the casualties in case of a System States space-attack. You can imagine, better than I can, what would be in them."  "Yes. Medical supplies of all sorts are getting hard to find. But look here; you're not going to let these people waste time looking for this alleged computer, this thing they call Merlin, are you?"  "We're looking for any valuable war material. I don't know the location of Merlin, but--"  "I'll bet you don't!" Lucas said vehemently. That was the same thing Flora had said.  "--but Merlin is undoubtedly the most valuable item of abandoned TF equipment on this planet. In the long run, I'd say, more valuable than everything else together. We certainly aren't going to ignore it."  "Good heavens, Conn! You aren't like these people here; you were educated at the University of Montevideo."  "So I was. I studied computer theory and practice. I have some doubts about Merlin being able to do some of the things these laymen like Kellton and Fawzi and Judge Ledue think it could. Those sorts of misconceptions and exaggerations have to be allowed for. But I have no doubt whatever that the master computer with which they did their strategic planning is probably the greatest mechanism of its sort ever built, and I have no doubt whatever that it still exists somewhere in the Alpha System."  He almost convinced himself of it. He did not, however, convince Wade Lucas, who was now regarding him with narrow-eyed suspicion.  "You mean you categorically state that that computer actually exists?"  "That, I think, was the general idea. Yes. I certainly do believe that Merlin exists."  Maybe he was telling the truth. Merlin existed in the beliefs and hopes of people like Dolf Kellton and Klem Zareff and Judge Ledue and Kurt Fawzi. Merlin was a god to them. Well, take Ghu, the Thoran Grandfather-God. Ghu was as preposterous, theologically, as Merlin was technologically; Ghu, except to Thorans, was a Federation-wide joke. But he'd known a couple of Thorans at the University, funny little fellows, with faces like terriers, their bodies covered with matted black hair. They believed in Ghu the way he believed in the Second Law of Thermodynamics. Ghu was with them every moment of their lives. Take away their belief in Ghu, and they would have been lost and wretched.  As lost and wretched as Kurt Fawzi or Judge Ledue, if they lost their belief in Merlin. He started to say something like that, and then thought better of it.  Yes, Virginia, there _is_ a Santa Claus.   V  The meeting was at the Academy; when Conn and his father arrived, they found the central hall under the topside landing stage crowded. Kurt Fawzi and Professor Kellton had constituted themselves a reception committee. Franz Veltrin was in evidence with his audiovisual recorder, and Colonel Zareff was leaning on his silver-headed sword cane. Tom Brangwyn, in an unaccustomed best-suit. Wade Lucas, among a group of merchants, arguing heatedly. Lorenzo Menardes, the distiller, and Lester Dawes, the banker, and Morgan Gatworth, the lawyer, talking to Judge Ledue. About four times as many as had been in Fawzi's office the afternoon before.  Finally, everybody was shepherded into a faculty conference room; there was a long table, and a shorter one T-wise at one end. Fawzi and Kellton conducted them to this. Both of them were trying to preside, Kellton because it was his Academy, and Fawzi ex officio as mayor and professional leading citizen, and because he had come to regard Merlin as his own private project. After everybody else was seated, the two rival chairmen-presumptive remained on their feet. Fawzi was saying, "Let's come to order; we must conduct this meeting regularly," and Kellton was saying, "Gentlemen, please; let me have your attention."  If either of them took the chair, the other would resent it. Conn got to his feet again.  "Somebody will have to preside," he said, loudly enough to cut through the babble at the long table. "Would you take the chair, Judge Ledue?"  That stopped it. Neither of them wanted to contest the honor with the president-judge of the Gordon Valley court.  "Excellent suggestion, Conn. Judge, will you preside?" Professor Kellton, who had seen himself losing out to Fawzi, asked. Fawzi threw one quick look around, estimated the situation, and got with it. "Of course, Judge. You're the logical chairman. Here, will you sit here?"  Judge Ledue took the chair, looked around for something to use as a gavel, and rapped sharply with a paperweight.  "Young Mr. Conn Maxwell, who has just returned from Terra, needs no introduction to any of you," he began. Then, having established that, he took the next ten minutes to introduce Conn. When people began fidgeting, he wound up with: "Now, only about a dozen of us were at the informal meeting in Mr. Fawzi's office, yesterday. Conn, would you please repeat what you told us? Elaborate as you see fit."  Conn rose. He talked briefly about his studies on Terra to qualify himself as an expert. Then he began describing the wealth of abandoned and still undiscovered Federation war material and the many installations of which he had learned, careful to avoid giving clues to exact locations. The spaceport; the underground duplicate Force Command Headquarters; the vast underground arsenals and shops and supply depots. Everybody was awed, even his father; he hadn't had time to tell him more than a fraction of it.  Finally, somebody from the long table interrupted:  "Well, Conn; how about Merlin? That's what we're interested in."  Wade Lucas snorted indignantly.  "He's telling you about real things, things worth millions of sols, and you want him to talk about that idiotic fantasy!"  There was an angry outcry. Nobody actually shouted "_To the stake with the blasphemer!_" but that was the general idea. Judge Ledue was rapping loudly for order.  "I don't know the exact location of Merlin." Conn strove to make himself heard. "The whole subject's classified top secret. But I am certain that Merlin exists, if not on Poictesme then somewhere in the Alpha System, and I am equally certain that we can find it."  Cheers. He waited for the hubbub to subside. Lucas was trying to yell above it.  "You admit you couldn't learn anything about this so-called Merlin, but you're still certain it exists?"  "Why are you certain it doesn't?"  "Why, the whole thing's absurdly fantastic!"  "Maybe it is, to a layman like you. I studied computers, and it isn't to me."  "Well, take all these elaborate preparations against space attack you were telling us about. I think Colonel Zareff, here, who served in the Alliance Army, will bear me out that such an attack was plainly impossible."  Zareff started to agree, then realized that he was aiding and comforting the enemy. "Intelligence lag," he said. "What do you expect, with General Headquarters thirty parsecs from the fighting?"  "Yes. A computer can only process the data that's been taped into it," Conn said. That was a point he wanted to ram home, as forcibly and as often as possible. "I suppose Merlin classified an Alliance attack on Poictesme as a low-order probability, but war is the province of chance; Clausewitz said that a thousand years ago. Foxx Travis wasn't the sort of commander to let himself get caught, even by a very low-order probability."  "Well how do you explain the absence, after forty years, of any mention, in any history of the War, of Merlin? How do you get around that?"  "I don't have to. How do you get around it?"  "_Huh?_" Lucas was startled.  "Yes. Stories about Merlin were all over Poictesme, all through the Third Force, even to the enemy. Say the stories were unfounded; say Merlin never existed. Yet the belief in Merlin was an important historical fact, and no history of the War gives it so much as a footnote." He paused for effect, then continued: "That can mean only one thing. Systematic suppression, backed by the whole force of the Terran Federation. A gigantic conspiracy of silence!"  Brother! If they swallow that, I have it made; they'll swallow anything!  They did, all but Lucas. He banged his fist on the table.  "Now I've heard everything!" he shouted in disgust.  "Not quite everything, Doctor," Morgan Gatworth said. "You will hear, one of these days, that we have found Merlin."  "Yes, that'll be the day!" Lucas sprang to his feet, his chair toppling behind him. He shoved it aside with his foot. "I'm not going to argue with you. Conn Maxwell gave you a thousand-year-old quotation; I'll give you another, from Thomas Paine: 'To argue with those who have renounced the use and authority of reason is as futile as to administer medicine to the dead.' I'll add this. Conn Maxwell knows better than this balderdash he's been spouting to you. I don't know what his racket is, and I'm not staying to find out. You will, though--to your regret."  He turned and strode from the room. There was a moment's silence, after the door slammed behind him. Too bad, Conn thought. He would have made a good friend. Now he was going to make a very nasty enemy.  "Well, let's get to business," his father said. "We don't have to argue about the existence of Merlin; we know that. Let's discuss the question of finding it."  "I still think it's somewhere off-planet," Lorenzo Menardes said. "The moons of Pantagruel...."  Evidently he'd read something, or seen an old film, about the moons of Pantagruel.  "No, that's too far; they'd keep it where they could use it."  "The old GHQ," Lester Dawes suggested. "Suppose it's down under that, like the place Rodney found under Tenth Army."  "I hope not," Gathworth said. "The Planetary Government took that over."  "Well, wherever it is, finding it is going to be expensive," Rodney Maxwell said. "Now, to finance the search, I propose we use this information my son brought back from Terra. Doctor Lucas was right about one thing; that's worth millions of sols. Well, I propose, also, that we set up a company and get it chartered; a prospecting company, to operate under the Abandoned Property Act of 867. My son and I will contribute this information as our share in the capitalization of the company. The work of opening these Federation installations can go on concurrently with the search for Merlin, and the profits can finance it."  Silence for a moment, then a bedlam of cheering.  "Well, let's get organized," Gatworth said. "What will we call this company?"  A number of voices shouted suggestions. Rodney Maxwell managed to get recognition and partial silence.  "It is of the first importance," he said, "that we keep our real objective--Merlin--as close a secret as possible. The Planetary Government would like to get hold of it--and I leave you to ask yourselves how far Jake Vyckhoven and his cronies are to be trusted with anything like that--and I have no doubt the Federation might try to take it away from us."  "Couldn't do it, Rodney," Judge Ledue objected. "Everything the Federation abandoned in the Trisystem is public domain now. We have a Federation Supreme Court ruling--"  "What's legality to the Federation?" Klem Zareff demanded. "They fought a criminally illegal war of aggression against my people."  Down the table, somebody started singing "Rally Round the Banner, the Banner Black and Green."  "Well, I think it's a good idea to keep quiet about it, myself," Kurt Fawzi said.  "All right," Rodney Maxwell said. "Then we don't want this company to sound like anything but another salvage company. I suggest we call it Litchfield Exploration & Salvage."  "Good name, Rodney," Dawes approved. "That a motion? I second it."  Unanimously carried. They had a name, now, anyhow. Everybody began suggesting other topics for consideration--capitalization, application for charter, election of officers, stock issues. Conn paid less and less attention. Industrial finance and organization wasn't his subject, either. His father was plunging happily into it as though he had been promoting companies all his life. Conn sat and doodled with his six-color pen, mostly spherical hyperspace ships.  "We can't get all this cleared up now," Lester Dawes was protesting. "Your Honor, I mean, Mr. Chairman; I suggest that committees be appointed...."  More hassling; everybody wanted to be on all the committees. Finally, they appointed enough committees to include everybody.  "Well, that seems to be cleared up," Judge Ledue said, "I suggest a meeting day after tomorrow evening; the committees should have everything set up, and we should be able to organize ourselves and elect permanent officers. Is there anything else to discuss, or do I hear a motion to adjourn?"  Somebody thought they ought to have some idea of what the first operation would be.  "You heard me mention a spaceport," Conn said. "I can tell you, now, that it's over on Barathrum, inside the crater of an extinct volcano. I think we ought to have a look at that, first of all."  "I know you seemed to think yesterday that Merlin is off-planet," Fawzi said, "I'm inclined to disagree, Conn. I think it's right here on Poictesme."  "We ought to nail that spaceport down first," Conn argued.  "Conn, you mentioned an underground duplicate of Travis's general headquarters," Zareff said. "They thought we'd possibly send a fleet here to blitz Poictesme, or they wouldn't have built that. And this underground headquarters would be the safest place on the planet; they'd make sure of that. Staff brass don't like to get caught out in the rain, not when it's raining hellburners and planetbusters. Merlin would be too big to take there along with them, so they'd put it there in the first place."  That made sense. If he'd been Foxx Travis, and if there had been a Merlin, that was exactly where he'd have put it himself. But there was no Merlin, and he wanted a ship. He argued mulishly for a little, then saw that it was hopeless and gave in.  "I want to find Merlin as much as any of you," he said. "More. Merlin was the only thing I was trained for. We'll look there first."  Somebody asked where, approximately, this underground Force Command headquarters was.  "Why, it's in the Badlands, over between the Blaubergs and the east coast."  "Great Ghu! We'll need an army to go in there?" Tom Brangwyn said. "That's where all these outlaws have been coming from, Blackie Perales and all."  "Then we'll get an army together," Klem Zareff said happily. "Might make a little of that reward money that's been offered."  "We'll need more than that. Well need excavation equipment, and labor. Lots of labor," Conn said. "It's a couple of hundred feet below the surface; from the plans, I'd say they just dug a big pit, built the headquarters in it, and filled it in. There are two entrances, a vertical shaft and a horizontal tunnel."  "When they pulled out, they probably filled the shaft and vitrified the rock at the outer ends," his father added. "That was what they did at Tenth Army."  Another idea hit him. "Mr. Mayor, do you think you could set up some kind of a public-works program here in Litchfield? We can't start this till after the wine-pressing's over, and we'll need a lot of labor, as I pointed out. Now, it's important that we keep all our projects a secret until we can get our claims filed. If we start this municipal fix-up-and-clean-up program, we can give work to a lot of these drifters who haven't been able to get jobs on the plantations, get them organized into gangs, and keep them together till we're ready for the Force Command job."  Lorenzo Menardes supported the idea. "And while they were boondoggling around in Litchfield, we could pick out the best workers, get rid of the incompetents, and train a few supervisors. That's going to be one of our worst headaches; getting capable supervisors."  "You telling me?" Rodney Maxwell asked. "That was what I was wondering about: where we'd get gang-bosses. And another thing; this municipal housecleaning would mask our real preparations."  "Well, we need something like that," Fawzi said. "We've needed it for a long time. I guess it took Conn, coming home from Terra, to see how badly we've let the town get run down. Franz, suppose you and Tom Brangwyn and Lorenzo form a committee on that. Look around, see what needs fixing up worst, and set up a project. Who's city engineer now?"  "Abe O'Leary; he died six years ago," Dawes said. "You never appointed his successor."  "Well, I guess I never got around to that," the mayor of Litchfield admitted.  When the meeting finally adjourned, they went up and got in the car; his father lifted it straight up to thirty thousand feet and started circling. An aircar was one place where they could talk safely.  "Conn, I was kind of worried, down there. You were being a little too positive. You know, you're only twenty-three. As long as you agree with those people, you're a brilliant young man; you start getting ideas of your own, and you're just a half-baked kid. You let the older and wiser heads run things. You can't begin to hope to foul things up the way they can. Look at all the experience they've had."  "But we've got to have a ship. Everything depends on that."  "I know it does. We'll get a ship. Let Kurt Fawzi and Klem Zareff and the rest of them have this duplicate Force Command thing first, though. Keep them happy. As soon as we have that opened, you can take a gang and run over to Barathrum and grab your spaceport. Wait till they find out that Merlin isn't at Force Command Duplicate. Then you can convince them it's really on Koshchei."   VI  The car Rodney Maxwell got out of the hangar the next morning wasn't the one he and Conn had gone to the meeting in; it was the one he had flown in from Tenth Army HQ at noon of the previous day. An Army reconnaissance job, slim and needlelike, completely enclosed, looking more like a missile than a vehicle, and armored in dazzling, iridescent collapsium. There was something to living on Poictesme, at that; only a millionaire on Terra could have owned a car like that.  "Nice," Conn said. "Where did you dig it?"  "Where we're going, Tenth Army."  "I'll bet she'll do Mach Three."  "Better than that. I've never had her above 2.5, but the airspeed gauge is marked up to four. And she has everything: all kinds of detection instruments, cameras, audiovisual pickups, armament. And the armor; you can take her through any kind of radiation."  The armor was only a couple of micromicrons thick, but it would stop anything. It was collapsed matter, the electron shells of the atoms collapsed upon the nuclei, the atoms in actual contact. That plating made eighth-inch sheet steel as heavy as twelve-inch armor plate, and in texture and shielding properties, lead was like sponge by comparison.  They climbed in, and Rodney Maxwell snapped on the screens that served as windows. Conn leaned back and looked at the underside view in a screen on the roof of the car, as his father started the lift-engine.  "Still think it's worth the price, son?" his father asked.  The price had begun to rise; even so, he was afraid that what they had paid so far was only the down payment. Dinner last evening. Flora, who had evidently been talking to Wade Lucas, shouting accusations at them; his mother fleeing from the table in tears. As the car rose, he reached out and turned on and adjusted the telescreen for the under-view.  "Keep your eye on that, Father," he said. "That's what we're paying to get rid of."  A distillery, bigger than the Menardes plant, long closed and now half roofless and crumbling. Rows of warehouses, empty after the War until taken over by homeless vagrants. Jerry-built shanties with rattletrap aircars grounded around them. Tramptown, a festering sore on the south side of Litchfield.  "If we put this over," he continued, "all those tramps will have steady work and good homes. We can have a park there, with fountains that'll work. Maybe even Flora and Mother will think we've done something worth doing."  "It'll be kind of hard to take in the meantime, though, but if you can take it, I can." Rodney Maxwell turned off the underside teleview screen and put on the forward one. "See that little pink spot over there? Sunrise on the east side of Snagtooth; Tenth Army's just behind us. Now, let's see if this airspeed gauge is telling the truth or just bragging."  Sudden acceleration pushed them back in their seats. The calibrations on the gauge rose swiftly; the pink-lighted peak grew swiftly in the teleview screen. The gauge hadn't been bragging, it had been understating; the car had more speed than the instrument could register. Two and a half minutes from Litchfield, they were decelerating and swinging slowly around Snagtooth, looking down on a tilted plateau that ended on the western side in a sheer drop of almost a thousand feet.  There were ruinous buildings on it: barracks and storehouses and offices, an airship dock and an air-traffic control tower from which all the glass had long ago vanished, a great steel telecast tower that had fallen, crushing a couple of buildings. Young trees had already grown among the wreckage.  "Look over there, on the slope below it; there's one entrance to the shelters." There was a clearing among the evergreens, half a mile from the buildings, and raw earth, and a couple of big scows grounded near. "They bulldozed rock and earth over the end of the tunnel. Then, there's another one down on that bench, a couple of hundred feet below the edge of the plateau. They blasted rock down over that. The main entrance is a vertical shaft under that pre-stressed concrete dome. That was chapel, auditorium, or something. They just covered it with sheet metal and poured a foot of concrete on top."  They floated down above the broken roofs and crumbling walls, and grounded in the area between the main administration building and the offices, back of the ship docks. Once, he supposed, it had been a lawn. Then it had been a jungle. Now it was a scuffed, littered, bare-trodden work-yard. Men were straggling out of the administration building, lighting pipes and cigarettes; they all wore new but work-soiled infantry battle dress. All of them waved and shouted greetings; one, about Conn's own age, approached. As he got out, Conn saw the resemblance to Lester Dawes, the banker, before he recognized Anse Dawes, who had been one of his closest friends six years ago. They shook hands and pounded each other on the back.  "Hey, you're looking great, Conn!" They all told him that; he'd begin to believe it pretty soon. "Sorry I couldn't make the party, but somebody had to sit on the lid here, and Jerry Rivas and I cut cards for it and Jerry won."  "You didn't tell me Anse was with you," he reproached his father. Rodney Maxwell said he'd been saving that for a surprise.  When Conn asked Anse what was the matter with the bank, he said: "For the birds; I'd as soon count sheets of toilet paper as this stuff we're using for money. Sooner. Toilet paper can be used for something, and this paper money's too stiff. Maybe some of this stuff we're digging here isn't worth much, but at least it's real."  That was something else the Maxwell Plan would have to take care of. Gresham's Law was running hog-wild on Poictesme. A Planetary Government sol was worth about ten centisols, Federation, and aside from deposit boxes, woolen socks under the mattress, and tin cans buried in the corner of the cellar, Federation currency was nonexistent.  "Had breakfast yet?" Rodney Maxwell asked.  "Oh, hours ago. I was out and shot another spikenose; it's hanging up back of the kitchen, waiting for the cook to skin it and cut it up." He grinned at Conn. "You don't get this kind of hunting in a bank, either."  "Jerry still inside? I want to see him. Suppose you take Conn around and show him the sights. And don't worry about him bumping you out of a job. Worry about the six or eight extra jobs you'll have to do besides your own, from now on."  Conn and Anse crossed the yard and entered one of the office buildings, through a big breach in the wall. Anse said: "I did that myself; 90-mm tank gun. When we want a wall out of the way, we get it out of the way." Inside were a lot of lifters and skids and power shovels and things; laborers were assembling for work assignments. Most of them had been with his father six years ago and he knew them. They hadn't done any growing up in the meantime. They climbed into an airjeep and floated out over the edge of the plateau, letting down past the sheer cliff to where the lower lateral shaft had been opened. A great deal of rock had been shoveled and bulldozed away to expose it; it was twenty feet high and forty wide. Anse simply steered the jeep inside and up the tunnel.  There were occasional lights on at the ceiling. Anse said they were all powered from their own nuclear-electric conversion units. "We don't have the central power on here; there's a big mass-energy converter, but we're tearing it down to ship out."  That was something they could get a good price for. Maybe even one-tenth of what it was worth. At least they wouldn't have to sell it by the ton.  The tunnel ended in an enormous room a couple of hundred feet square and fifty high. There was a wide aisle up the middle; on either side, contragravity equipment was massed. Tanks with long 90-mm guns. Combat cars. Small airboats. Rank on rank of air-cavalry single-mounts, egg-shaped things just big enough for a man to sit in, with quadruple machine guns in front and flame-jets behind. Ambulances armored against radiation; decontamination units; mobile workshops; mobile kitchens. Troop carriers, jeeps, staff cars; power shovels, manipulators, lifters. All waiting, for forty years, to swarm out as soon as the bombs that never came stopped falling.  They floated the jeep along hallways beyond, and got down to look into rooms. Work was already going on in the power plant; a gang under a slim young man whom Anse introduced as Mohammed Matsui were using repair-robots to get canisters of live plutonium out of a reactor. Workshops. Laundries. Storerooms. Kitchens, some stripped and a few still intact. A hospital. Guardhouse and lockup.  More storerooms on the level above, reached by returning to the vehicle hangar and lifting to an upper entrance. By this time, gangs were at work there, too, moving contragravity skids in empty and out loaded.  "The CO here must have had squirrel blood," Anse said. "I think when the evacuation orders came through he just gathered up everything there was topside and crammed it down here, any old way. Honest to Ghu, this place was packed solid when we found it. Nobody'd believe it."  "Wait till you see the next one."  "You mean there's another place like this?"  "You can say so. You can say a twenty-megaton thermonuclear is like a hand grenade, too."  Anse Dawes simply didn't believe that.  When they got back to the Administration Building on top, they found Rodney Maxwell, Jerry Rivas, the general foremen, and half a dozen gang foremen, in consultation.  "We're getting a hundred and fifty more men and ten farm scows from Litchfield," his father said. "Dave McCade's coming out from our yard, and Tom Brangwyn's sending one of his deputies to help boss them. Well have to keep an eye on this crowd; they're all Tramptown hoodlums, but that's the best we can get. We're going to have to get this place cleaned out in a hurry. We only have about two weeks till the wine-pressing's over, and then we want to start the next operation. Conn, did you see all that engineering equipment, down on the bottom level?"  "Yes. I think we ought to leave a lot of that here--the shovels and bulldozers and manipulators and so on. We can move it direct to Force Command. How are we fixed for blasting explosives?"  "Name it and we have it. Cataclysmite, FJ-7, anything you want."  "We'll need a lot of it."  "We're going to have to get a ship. I mean a contragravity ship, a freighter; first, to move this stuff out of here, and then to move the stuff out of Force Command. And we want it mounted with heavy armament, too. We not only want a freighter, we want a fighting ship."  "You think so?"  "I'm sure of it," Rodney Maxwell said. "Where we're going is full of outlaws; there must be hundreds of them holing up over there. That's where all the trouble on the east coast comes from. Now, outlaws are sure-thing players. They want to be alive to spend their loot, and they won't tackle anything that's too tough for them. A lot of guards and combat equipment may look like a loss on the books, but the books won't show how much of a loss you might take if you didn't have them. I want this operation armed till it'll be too much for all the outlaws on the planet to tackle."  That made sense. It also made sense out of the billions of sols the Federation had spent preparing for an invasion that never came. If it had come and found them unprepared, the loss might have been the war itself.  The scows and the newly hired workers began arriving a little after noon. The scows had been borrowed from plantations where the crop had been gotten in; there were melon leaves and bits of vine in the bottoms. The workers were a bleary-eyed and unsavory lot; Conn had a suspicion, which Brangwyn's deputy confirmed, that they had been collected by mass vagrancy arrests in Tramptown. As soon as they started arriving, Jerry Rivas hurried down to the old provost-marshal's headquarters and came back with a lot of rubber billy-clubs, which he issued to his gang-bosses, regular and temporary. A few times they had to be used. By evening, however, the insubordinate and troublesome had been quieted. They would all steal anything they could put in their pockets, but that was to be expected. By evening, too, the contents of the underground treasure trove was moving out in a steady stream, and scows were shuttling to and from Litchfield.  Rodney Maxwell was going back to town after lunch the next day. Conn wanted to know if he should go along.  "No, you stay here; help keep things moving. Remember what I told you about the older and wiser heads? Let me handle them. I've been around them, heaven pity me, longer than you have. Just give me an audiovisual of your proxy and I'll vote your stock."  "How much stock do I have, by the way?"  "The same as I have--ten thousand five hundred shares of common, at twenty centisols a share. But watch where it goes after we open Force Command."  His father was back, two days later, to report:  "We're organized. Kurt Fawzi's president, of course, and does he love it. That'll keep him out of mischief. Dolf Kellton's secretary; he has an office force at the Academy and can conscript students to help. He's organizing a research team from his seniors and post-grad students to work in the Planetary Library at Storisende. There are a lot of old Third Force records there; he may find something useful. Of course, Lester Dawes is treasurer."  "What are you?"  "Vice-president in charge of operations. That's what I spent all yesterday log-rolling, baby-kissing and cigar-passing to get."  "And what am I, if it's a fair question?"  "You have a very distinguished position; you are a non-office-holding stockholder. The only other one is Judge Ledue; as a member of the judiciary, he did not feel it proper to accept official position in a private corporation. Tom Brangwyn's Chief of Company Police; Klem Fawzi is Commander of the Company Guards. And we have a law firm in Storisende lined up to handle our charter application. Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong. Sterber's married to Jake Vyckhoven's sister, Flynn's son is married to the daughter of the Secretary of the Treasury, and Chen-Wong is a nephew of the Chief Justice. All of them are directly descended from members of Genji Gartner's original crew."  "You don't anticipate any trouble about getting the charter?"  "Not exactly. And Lester Dawes is in Storisende now, trying to find us a contragravity ship. There are about a dozen in the hands of receivers for bankrupt shipping companies; he might find one that's still airworthy. Oh; you remember how I insisted on absolute secrecy about our Merlin objective? That's working out better than my fondest expectations. It's leaking like a machine-gunned water tank, and everybody it leaks to is positive that we know exactly where Merlin is or we wouldn't be trying to keep it a secret."  Three days later, Conn hitched a ride on a freight-scow to Litchfield. From the air, he could see a haze of bonfire smoke over High Garden Terrace, and a gang of men at work. There were more men at work on the Mall and along the streets on either side. He went up from the yard below the house, where the scow was being unloaded, and found his mother in the living room watching a screen play with one eye and keeping the other on a soulless machine like a miniature contragravity tank, which was going over the carpet with a vacuum cleaner and taking swipes at the furniture with a rotary dustmop. She was glad to see him, and then became troubled.  "Conn, when Flora comes home, you won't argue with her, will you?"  "Only in self-defense." That was the wrong thing to say. He changed it to, "No; I won't argue with her at all," and then quoted Wade Lucas quoting Thomas Paine. Then he had to assure his mother a couple of times that there really was a Merlin, and then assure her that it wouldn't get loose and hurt anybody if he did find it.  In the middle of his assurances about the harmlessness of Merlin, the housecleaning-robot began knocking things off the top of a table.  "Oscar! You stop that!" his mother yelled.  Oscar, deaf as the adder, kept on. Conn yelled at his mother to use her control; she remembered that she had one, a thing like an old-fashioned pocket watch, around her neck on a chain, and got the robot stopped.  No wonder she was afraid of Merlin.  He took advantage of the interruption to get to his room and change clothes, then went up to the hangar and got out an air-cavalry mount. About fifty men were working on High Garden Terrace, pruning and trimming and leveling the lawns. There was a big vitrifier on the Mall--even at five hundred feet he could feel the heat from it--chuffing and clanking and pouring lavalike molten rock for a new pavement. And all the nymphs and satyrs and dryads and fauns and centaurs had had their pedestals rebuilt and were sand-blasted clean.  He landed on the top of the Airlines Building and rode a lift down to the office where Kurt Fawzi neglected the affairs of his shipline agency, his brokerage business, and the city of Litchfield. The afternoon habitues had begun to gather--Raymond Fitch, the used-vehicles dealer, Lorenzo Menardes, Judge Ledue, Tom Brangwyn, Klem Zareff. Fawzi was on the screen, talking to somebody with sandy hair and a suit that didn't seem to be made of any sort of Federation Armed Forces material, about warehouse facilities. The addresses they were mentioning were in Storisende.  "No, Leo, I don't know when," Fawzi was saying, "but don't you worry. You just have space for it, and we'll fill it up. And don't ask me what sort of stuff. You know what a salvage operation's like; you just haul out the stuff as you come to it."  Tom Brangwyn, lounging in one of the deep chairs, looked up.  "Hello, Conn. We're having a time. Another two hundred tramps came in on the _Countess_ this morning, and Ghu only knows how many in their own vehicles, and they all seem to think if there's work for some there ought to be work for all, and some of them are getting nasty."  "We can use some more out at the dig. The ones you sent out Thursday are doing all right, once they found out we weren't taking any foolishness."  Fawzi turned away from the screen. "Well, Conn, we're in," he said. "The charter was granted this morning; now we're Litchfield Exploration & Salvage, Ltd. And Lester Dawes has found us a contragravity ship."  "How much will it cost us?"  Fawzi began to laugh. "Conn, this'll slay you! She isn't costing us a centisol. You know those old ships on Mothball Row, back of the old West End ship docks at Storisende?"  Conn nodded. He'd seen them before he had gone away, and from the  _City of Asgard_ coming in--a lot of old Army Transport craft, covered with muslin and sprayed with protectoplast. The Planetary Government had taken them over after the War and forgotten them.  "Well, Lester's getting one of them for us under the old 878 Commercial Enterprise Encouragement Act. She's an Army combat freighter, regimental ammunition ship. Of course, she still has armament; we'll have to pay to get that off."  "Why?"  Fawzi looked at him in surprise. "It would only be in the way and add weight. We want her for a cargo ship, don't we?"  "That's what she was built for. What kind of armament?"  Fawzi didn't know. Klem Zareff did.  "Four 115-mm rifles, two fore and two aft. A pair of lift-and-drive missile launchers amidships. And a secondary gun battery of 70-mm's and 50-mm auto-cannon. I know the class; we captured a few of them. Good ships."  Fawzi was horrified. "Why, that's more firepower than the whole Air Patrol. Look, the Government won't like our having anything like that."  "They're giving her to us, aren't they?" Menardes asked.  "Gehenna with what the Government likes!" the old Rebel swore. "If they'd put a few of those ships into commission, they could wipe out these outlaws and a private company wouldn't need an armed ship."  "May I use your screen, Kurt?" Conn asked.  When Fawzi nodded, he punched out the combination of the operating office at Tenth Army, and finally got his father on. He told him about the ship.  "There's talk about tearing the armament out," he added.  "Is that so, now? Well, I'll call Lester Dawes before he can get started on it. I think I'll go in to Storisende tomorrow and see the ship for myself. See what I can do about ammunition for those guns, too."  "But, Rod," Fawzi protested, joining the conversation, "we don't want to start a war."  "No. We want to stay out of one. You don't do that by disarming. We're taking that ship down into the Badlands. Remember?" Rodney Maxwell said. "Ever hear the name Blackie Perales?"  Fawzi had. He stopped arguing about armament. Instead, he began worrying about how much the civic clean-up campaign was costing Litchfield.  "You think we really need that, Rod?"  "Of course we do. You'd be surprised how much labor we're going to need, and how hard up we're going to be for capable supervisors. This thing's a training program, Kurt, and we'll need every man we train on it."  "But it's costing like Nifflheim, Rod. We're going to bankrupt the city."  "Worse than it is now, you mean? Oh, don't worry, Kurt. As soon as we find Merlin, everything'll be all right."  Franz Veltrin came in, shortly after Rodney Maxwell was off the screen. He dropped his audiovisual camera and sound recorder on the table, laid his pistol-belt on top of them and took a drink of brandy, downing it with the audible satisfaction of a thirsty horse at a trough. Then he looked around accusingly.  "Somebody's been talking!" he declared. "I've had all the news services on the planet on my screen today; they all want the story about what's happening here. They've heard we know where Merlin is; that Conn Maxwell found out on Terra."  "They just put two and two together and threw seven," Conn said. "A _Herald-Guardian_ ship-news reporter interviewed me when I got in, and found out I'd been studying cybernetics and computer theory on Terra. What did you tell them?"  "Complete denial. We don't know a thing about Merlin. Naturally, they didn't believe me. A bunch of them are coming out here tomorrow. What are we going to tell them? We'll all have to have the same story."  "I," said Judge Ledue, "am not going to be interviewed, I am leaving town till they're gone."  "Why don't you steer them onto Wade Lucas?" Conn asked. "If you want anything denied, he'll do it for you."  Everybody thought that was a wonderful idea, except Klem Zareff, and he waited until Conn was ready to go and rode up to the landing stage with him.  "Conn, I know this Lucas is going to marry your sister," he began, "but how much do you know about him?"  "Not much. He seems like a nice chap. I don't hold what he said at the meeting against him. I suppose if I'd come from off-planet, I wouldn't believe in Merlin either."  "Hah! But doesn't he believe in Merlin?"  "He makes noises like it."  "You know what I think?" Klem Zareff lowered his voice to a whisper. "I think he's a Federation spy! I think the Federation's lost Merlin. That's why they haven't come back to get it long ago."  "Pretty big thing to mislay."  "It could happen. There'd only be a few scientists and some high staff officers who'd know where it was. Well, say they all went back to Terra on the same ship, and the ship was lost at space. Sabotage, one of our commerce raiders that hadn't heard the War was over, maybe just an ordinary accident. But the ship's lost, and the location of Merlin's lost with her."  "That could happen," Conn agreed seriously.  "All right. So ever since, they've had people here, listening, watching, spying. This Lucas; he showed up here about a year after you went to Terra. And who does he get engaged to? Your sister. And what does he do here? Goes around arguing that there is no Merlin, getting people to argue with him, getting them mad, so they'll blurt out anything they know. I'm an old field officer; I know all the prisoner-interrogation tricks in the book, and that's always been one of the best."  "Then why did he act the way he did at the meeting? All he did there was cut himself off from learning anything more from any of us. In his place, would you have done that? No; you'd have tried to take the lead in hunting for Merlin yourself. Now wouldn't you?"  Zareff was silent, first puzzled, and then hurt. Now he would have to tear the whole idea down and build it over.  Flora was quite friendly when she came home from school. She'd found out, somewhere, that Conn had been the originator of the municipal face-lifting project. He was tempted, briefly, to tell her a little, if not all, of the truth about the Maxwell Plan, then decided against it. The way to keep a secret was to confide it to nobody; every time you did, you doubled, maybe even squared, the chances of exposure.  He told his father, when Rodney Maxwell came in from the dig, about his talk with Klem Zareff.  "How long's he been like that, anyhow?" he asked.  "As long as I've known him. When it comes to melons and wine and bossing tramp labor and taking care of his money and coming in out of the rain, Klem Zareff's as sane as I am. But on the subject of the Terran Federation, he's crazy as a bedbug. What is a bedbug, anyhow?"  "They have them on Terra, in places like Tramptown. They have places like Tramptown on Terra, too."  "Uhuh. I suppose, in Klem's boots, I'd be just as crazy as he is," Rodney Maxwell said. "One minute, he had a wife and two children in Kindelburg, on Ashmodai, and the next minute Kindelburg was a puddle of radioactive slag."  "That was in '51, wasn't it? I read about it," Conn said. "It was a famous victory."  That was from a poem, too.  Rodney Maxwell flew to Storisende early the next morning. Conn rode back to Tenth Army on an empty scow and pitched into the job of getting the stores and equipment out of the underground shelters. More farm-tramps arrived, and had to be pounded into obedience and taught the work. At the same time, Litchfield was getting a steady influx of job-seekers, and a secondary swarm of thugs, grifters and gangsters who followed them. Klem Zareff, having gotten all his melons pressed, came out to Tenth Army, where he selected fifty of the best men from the work-gangs and began drilling them as soldiers to guard the next operation. The manual of arms, drill and salute he taught them was, of course, System States Alliance.  A week later, the ship arrived from Storisende; a hundred and sixty feet, three thousand tons, small enough to be berthed inside a hyperspace transport, and fast enough to get a load of ammunition to troops at the front, unload, and get out again before the enemy could zero in on her, and armed to fight off any Army Air Force combat craft. The delay had been in recruiting officers and crew. The captain and chief engineer were out-of-work shipline officers, the gunner was a former Federation artillery officer, and the crew looked more like pirates than most pirates did.  They christened her the _Lester Dawes_, because Dawes had secured her and because the name began with the initials of Litchfield Exploration & Salvage. From then on, it was a race to see whether the Tenth Army attack-shelters would be emptied before the wine was all pressed, or vice versa.   VII  Fifty-two years before, they had come to the mesa in the Badlands and dug a pit on top of it, a thousand feet in diameter and more than five hundred deep, and in it they built a duplicate of the headquarters for Third Fleet-Army Force Command. They built a shaft a hundred feet in diameter like a chimney at one side, and they ran a tunnel out through solid rock to the head of a canyon half a mile away. Then they buried the whole thing. Twelve years later, when the War was over, they sealed both entrances and went away and left it.  For a month each winter, cold rains from the east lashed the desert; for the rest of the year, it was swept by windblown sand. Wiregrass sprouted, and thornbush grew; Nature, the master-camoufleur, completed the work of hiding the forgotten headquarters. Little things not unlike rabbits scampered over it, and bigger things, vaguely foxlike, hunted them. Hunted men came, too, their aircars skimming low. None of them had the least idea what was underneath.  The mesa-top came suddenly to life, just as the sun edged up out of the east. Conn and his father and Anse Dawes came in first, in the recon-car with which they had scouted and photographed the site a few days before. They circled at a thousand feet, fired a smoke bomb, and then let down near where Conn's map showed the head of the vertical shaft. The rest followed, first a couple of combat cars that circled slowly, scanning the ground, and then the _Lester Dawes_ with her big guns and her load of equipment, and behind a queue of boats and scows and heavy engineering equipment on contragravity and troop carriers full of workmen and guards, flanked by air cavalry, which circled above while everything else landed, then scattered out over a fifty-mile radius. Occasionally there was a hammering of machine guns, either because somebody saw something on the ground that might need shooting at or simply because it was a beautiful morning to make a noise.  The ship settled quickly and daintily, while Conn and Anse and Rodney Maxwell sat in the car and watched. Immediately, she began opening like a beetle bursting from its shell, large sections of armor swinging outward. Except for the bridge and the gun turrets, almost the whole ship could be opened; she had been designed to land in the middle of a battle and deliver ammunition when seconds could mean the difference between life and death. Jeeps and lifters and manipulators and things floated out of her. Scows began landing and unloading prefab-hut elements. A water tank landed, and the cook-shed began going up beside it; a lorry came in with scanning and probing equipment, and a couple of men jumped off and huddled over a photoprint copy of one of Conn's maps.  Conn lifted the car again and coasted it half a mile to where the cleft in the mesa started. There were half a dozen claw-armed manipulators already there, and two giant power shovels. Jerry Rivas and one of the engineers Kurt Fawzi had hired had gotten out of a jeep and were looking at another photoprint of the map. Rivas pointed to the head of the canyon, where a mass of rock had slid down.  "That's it; you can still see where they put off the shots."  The canyon was long enough and wide enough for the _Lester Dawes_ to land in it; she could be loaded directly from the tunnel. The manipulators began moving in, wrestling with the larger chunks of rock and dragging or carrying them away. Power shovels began grunting and clanking and rumbling; dust rose in a thick column. Toward midmorning, the troop carriers which served as school buses in Litchfield arrived, loaded with more workmen. A lorry lettered STORISENDE HERALD-GUARDIAN came in, hovered over the canyon, and began transmitting audiovisuals. More news-folk put in an appearance.  The earth and rock at the top of the tunnel entrance fell away, revealing the vitrified stone lintel; everybody cheered and dug harder. More aircars arrived, getting in each other's and everybody else's way. Raymond Fitch, Lester Dawes, Lorenzo Menardes and Morgan Gatworth. Dolf Kellton, playing hookey from school. Kurt Fawzi; he landed in the canyon and watched every shovelful of rock lifted, as though trying to help with mental force. Tom Brangwyn, with a score of the Home Guard to reinforce the Company Police. Klem Zareff called in his air cavalry to help control the sightseers. Nobody was making trouble; they were just getting in the way.  At eleven, Rodney Maxwell went aboard the _Lester Dawes_ to use the radio and telescreen equipment. By then, two time zones west in Storisende, the Claims Office was opening; he filed preliminary claim to an underground installation with at least two entrances in uninhabited country, and claimed a ten-mile radius around it. By that time, the gang working on top had uncovered a vitrified slab over the hundred-foot circle of the vertical shaft and were cracking it with explosives. According to the scanners, it was full of loose rubble for a hundred feet down. Below that, the microrays hit something impenetrable.  Toward midafternoon, the tunnel in the canyon was cleared. It had been vitrified solid; the scanners reported that it was plugged for ten feet. A contragravity tank let down in front of it, with a solenoid jackhammer mounted where the gun should have been, and began pounding, running a hole in for a blast shot. There were more explosions topside; when Conn took a jeep up to observe progress there, he found the vitrified rock blown completely off the vertical shaft, exposing the rubble that had been dumped into it. The gang on the mesa-top had discovered something else; a grid of auro-copper bussbars buried four feet underground. Ten to one, radio and telescreen signals would be transmitted to that from below, and then probably picked up and rebroadcast from a relay station on one or another of the high buttes in the neighborhood. Time enough to look for that later. He returned to the canyon, where the lateral tunnel was now almost completely open.  When it was clear, they sent a snooper in first. It was a robot, looking slightly like a short-tailed tadpole, six feet long by three feet at the thickest. It transmitted a view of the tunnel as it went slowly in; the air, it found, was breathable, and there were no harmful radiations or other dangers. According to the plans, there should be a big room at the other end, slightly curved, a hundred feet wide by a hundred on either side of the tunnel entrance. The robot entered this, and in its headlight they could see reconnaissance-cars, and contragravity tanks with 90-mm guns. It swerved slightly to the left, and then the screen stopped receiving, the telemetered instruments went dead and the robot's signal stopped.  "Tom," Rodney Maxwell said, "you keep the crowd back. Klem, stay with the screens; I'll transmit to you. I'm going in to see what's wrong."  He started to give Conn an argument when he wanted to accompany him.  "No," Conn said. "I'm going along. What do you think I went to Terra to study robotics for?"  His father snapped on the screen and pickup of the jeep that was standing nearby. "You getting it, Klem?" he asked. "Okay, Conn. Let's go."  Half a mile ahead, at the other end of the tunnel, they could see a flicker of light that grew brighter as they advanced. The snooper still had its light on and was moving about. Once they caught a momentary signal from it. As Rodney Maxwell piloted the jeep, Conn kept talking to Klem Zareff, outside. Then they were at the end of the tunnel and entering the room ahead; it was full of vehicles, like the one on the bottom level at Tenth Army HQ. As soon as they were inside, Klem Zareff's voice in the radio stopped, as though the set had been shot out.  "Klem! What's wrong? We aren't getting you," his father was saying.  The snooper was drifting aimlessly about, avoiding the parked vehicles. Conn used the manual control to set it down and deactivate it, then got out and went to examine it.  "Take the jeep over to the tunnel entrance," he told his father. "Move out into the tunnel a few feet; relay from me to Klem."  The jeep moved over. A moment later his father cried, "He's getting me; I'm getting him. What's the matter with the radio in here? The snooper's all right, isn't it?"  It was. Conn reactivated it and put it up above the tops of the vehicles.  "Sure. We just can't transmit out."  "But only half a mile of rock; that set's good for more than that. It'll transmit clear through Snagtooth."  "It won't transmit through collapsium."  His father swore disgustedly, repeating it to Zareff outside. Conn could hear the old soldier, in the radio, make a similar remark. They should have all expected that, in the first place. If the Third Force High Command was expecting to sit out a nuclear bombardment in this place, they'd armor it against anything.  "Bring the gang in; it's safe as far as we've gotten," his father said. "We'll just have to string wires out."  Conn used his flashlight and found the power unit for the room lights; all the overhead lights were wired to one unit, if wired were the word for gold-leaf circuits cemented to the walls and covered with insulating paint. For the heavy stuff, like the ventilator fans, they'd have to find the central power plant. He looked around the big room, poking into some of the closets that lined it. Radiation-proof clothing. Tools. Arms and ammunition. First-aid kits. Emergency rations. All the vehicles were plated in shimmering collapsium.  The crowd started coming in: the work-gangs selected for the first exploration work, most of them old hands of Rodney Maxwell's; the engineers they had recruited; Mohammed Matsui--he had a gang of his own, the same one he had been using in tearing down the converter at Tenth Army; the stockholders and officials; the press. And everybody else Tom Brangwyn's police hadn't been able to keep out.  The power plant was at the extreme bottom; Matsui began looking it over at once. Above it they found the service facilities--air-and-water plant; pumps for the artesian well; sewage disposal. Then repair ships, and a laboratory, and laundries and kitchens above that.  "Where do you suppose it is?" Kurt Fawzi was asking. "Up at the very top, I suppose. Let's go up and work down; I can't wait till we've found it."  Like a kid on Christmas Eve, Conn thought. And there was no Santa Claus, and Christmas had been abolished.  The place was built in concentric circles, level above level. Combat equipment nearest the tunnel exit and nearest the vertical shaft, and ambulances and decontamination units and equipment for relief and rebuilding next. Storerooms, mile on circular mile of them. Not the hasty packrat cramming he'd seen at Tenth Army; everything had been brought in in order, carefully piled or racked, and then left. More stores for the next three levels up; then living quarters. Enlisted men's and women's quarters, no signs of occupancy. Enlisted kitchens and mess halls, untouched.  Most of the officers' quarters were similarly unused, but here and there some had been occupied. A sloppily made bed. A used cake of soap in the bathroom. An empty bottle in a closet. Officers' commissary stores had been used from and replaced; the officers' mess hall and kitchen had been in constant use, and the officers' club had a comfortably scuffed and lived-in look. There had been a few people there all the time of the War.  "Men and women, all officers or civilians," Klem Zareff said. "Didn't even have enlisted men to cook for them. And we haven't found a scrap of paper with writing on it, or an inch of recorded sound-tape or audiovisual film. Remember those big wire baskets, down at the mass-energy converters? Before they left, they disintegrated every scrap of writing or recording. This is where Merlin is; they were the people who worked with it."  And above, offices. General Staff. War Planning, with an incredibly complex star-map of the theater of war. Judge Advocate General. Inspector General. Service of Supply. They were full of computers, each one firing the hopes of people like Fawzi and Dolf Kellton and Judge Ledue, but they were only special-purpose machines, the sort to be found in any big business office. The Storisende Stock Exchange probably had much bigger ones.  Then they found big ones, rank on rank of cabinets, long consoles studded with lights and buttons, programming machines.  "It's Merlin!" Fawzi almost screamed. "We've found it!"  One of the reporters who had followed them in snatched his radio handphone from his belt and jabbered, then, realizing that the collapsium shielding kept him from getting out with it, he replaced it and bolted away.  "Hold it!" Conn yelled at the others, who were also becoming hysterical. "Wait till I take a look at this thing."  They managed to calm themselves. After all, he should know what it was; wasn't that why he'd gone to school on Terra? They followed him from machine to machine, first hopefully and then fearfully. Finally he turned, shaking his head and feeling like the doctor in a film show, telling the family that there's no hope for Grandpa.  "This is not Merlin. This is the personnel-file machine. It's taped for the records and data of every man and woman in the Third Force for the whole War. It's like the student-record machine at the University."  "Might have known it; this section in here's marked G-1 all over everything; that's personnel. Wouldn't have Merlin in here," Klem Zareff was saying.  "Well, we'll just keep on hunting for it till we do find it," Kurt Fawzi said. "It's here somewhere. It has to be."  The next level up was much smaller. Here were the offices of the top echelons of the Force Command Staff. They, unlike the ones below, had been used; from them, too, every scrap of writing or film or record-tape had vanished.  Finally, they entered the private office of Force-General Foxx Travis. It had not only been used, it was in disorder. Ashtrays full, many of the forty-year-old cigarette ends lipstick tinted. Chairs shoved around at random. Three bottles on the desk, with Terran bourbon labels; two empty and one with about an inch of whisky left in it. But no glasses.  That bothered Conn. Somehow, he couldn't quite picture the commander and staff of the Third Fleet-Army Force passing bottles around and drinking from the neck. Then he noticed that the wall across the room was strangely scarred and scratched. Dropping his eye to the floor under it, he caught the twinkle of broken glass. They had gathered here, and talked for a long time. Then they had risen, for a final toast, and when it was drunk, they had hurled their glasses against the wall and smashed them.  Then they had gone out, leaving the broken glass and the empty bottles; knowing that they would never return.   VIII  Before they returned to the lower level into which the lateral tunnel entered, Matsui and his gang had the power plant going; the ventilator fans were humming softly, and whenever they pressed a starting button, the escalators began to move. They got the pumps going, and the oxygen-generators, and the sewage disposal system. Until the communication center could be checked and the relay station found, they ran a cable out to the _Lester Dawes_, landed in the canyon, and used her screen-and-radio equipment. Before the Claims Office in Storisende closed, Rodney Maxwell had transmitted in recorded views of the interior, and enough of a description for a final claim. They also received teleprint copies of the Storisende papers. The first story, in an extra edition of the _Herald-Guardian_, was headlined, MERLIN FOUND! That would have been the reporter who bolted off prematurely when they first saw the personnel record machines. Conn wondered if he still had a job. A later edition corrected this, but was full of extravagant accounts of what had been discovered. Merlin or no Merlin, Force Command Duplicate was the biggest abandoned-property discovery since the Third Force left the Trisystem.  The camp they had set up on top of the mesa was used, that night, only by Klem Zareff's guards. Everybody else was inside, eating cold rations when hungry and, when they could keep awake no longer, bedding down on piles of blankets or going up to the barracks rooms above.  The next day they found the relay station which rebroadcast signals from the buried aerial--or wouldn't one say, sub-terrial--on top of the mesa. As Conn had expected, it was on top of a high butte three and a half miles to the south; it had been so skillfully camouflaged that none of the outlaw bands who roamed the Badlands had found it. After that, Force Command Duplicate was in communication with the rest of Poictesme.  They moved into the staff headquarters at the top; Foxx Travis's office, tidied up, became the headquarters for the company officials and chief supervisors. The workmen quartered themselves in the enlisted barracks, helping themselves liberally to anything they found. The crowds of sightseers kept swarming in, giving Tom Brangwyn's police plenty to do. Tom himself turned the marshal's office in Litchfield over to his chief deputy. Klem Zareff insisted on more men for his guard force. A dozen gunboats, eighty-foot craft mounting one 90-mm gun, several smaller auto-cannon and one missile-launcher, had been found; he took them over immediately, naming them for capital ships of the old System States Navy. It took some argument to dissuade him from repainting all of them black and green. He kept them all in the air, with a swarm of smaller airboats and combat-cars, circling the underground headquarters at a radius of a hundred miles. These patrols reported a general exodus from the region. At least a dozen outlaw bands, all with fast contragravity, had been camped inside the zone. Some fled at once; the rest needed only a few warning shots to send them away. Other bands, looking like legitimate prospecting parties, began to filter into the Badlands. Zareff came to Rodney Maxwell--instead of Kurt Fawzi, the titular head of the company, which was significant--to find out what policy regarding them would be.  "Well, we have no right to keep them out, as long as they stay outside our ten-mile radius," Conn's father said. "And as we're the only thing that even looks like law around here, I'd say we have an obligation to give them protection. Have your boats investigate them; if they're legitimate, tell them they can call on us for help if they need it."  Conn protested, privately.  "There's a lot of stuff around here, in small caches," he said. "Equipment for guerrilla companies, in event of invasion. When work slacks off here, we could pick that stuff up."  "Conn, there's an old stock-market maxim: 'A bear can make money sometimes, and a bull can make money sometimes, but in the long run, a hog always loses.' Let the other people find some of this; it'll all help the Plan. Fact is, I've been thinking of leaking some information, if I can do it without Fawzi and that gang finding out. Do you know a good supply depot or something like that, say over on Acaire, or on the west coast? Big enough to be important, and to start a second prospectors' rush away from us."  "How about one of those hospitals?"  "No; not a hospital. We might use them to talk Wade Lucas into joining us. A lot of medical stores would be a good bait for him. I'm afraid he's going to make trouble if we don't do something about him."  "Well, how about engineering and construction equipment? I know where there's a lot of that, down to the southwest."  "That's farming country; that stuff'll be useful down there. I'll do that."  The next morning, Rodney Maxwell scorched the stratosphere to Storisende in his recon-car. The day after he got back, there was a big discovery of engineering equipment to the southwest and, as he had anticipated, a second rush of prospectors. They had the vertical shaft clear now, and the _Lester Dawes_ was shuttling back and forth between Force Command Duplicate and Storisende. Other ships were coming in, now, mostly privately owned freighting ships. They bought almost anything, as fast as it came out.  The stock market had been paralyzed for a couple of days after the discovery of Force Command; nobody seemed to know what to sell and what to hold. Now it was going perfectly insane. Twenty or thirty new companies were being formed; unlike Litchfield Exploration & Salvage, they were all offering their stock to the public. A week after the opening of Force Command, the Stock Exchange reported the first half-million-share day since the War. A week after that, there were two million-share days in succession.  Some of the L. E. & S. stockholders who had come out on the first day began drifting back to Litchfield. Lester Dawes was the first to defect; there was nothing he could do at Force Command, and a great deal that needed his personal attention at the bank. Morgan Gatworth and Lorenzo Menardes and one or two others followed. Kurt Fawzi, however, refused to leave. Merlin was somewhere here at Force Command, he was sure of it, and he wasn't leaving till it was found. Neither were Franz Veltrin or Dolf Kellton or Judge Ledue. Tom Brangwyn resigned as town marshal; Klem Zareff was too busy even to think of Merlin; he had almost as many men under his command, and twice as much contragravity, as he had had when the System States Alliance Army had surrendered.  Conn flew to Litchfield, and found that the public works project had come to a stop at noon of the day when Force Command was entered, and that nothing had been done on it since. The cold vitrifier was still standing in the middle of the Mall, and topside Litchfield was littered in a dozen places with forsaken equipment and half-completed paving. There was no one in Kurt Fawzi's office in the Airlines Building, and the employment office was jammed with migratory workers vainly seeking jobs.  He hunted up Morgan Gatworth, the lawyer.  "Can't some of you get things started again?" he wanted to know. "This place is worse than it was before they started cleaning up."  "Yes, I know." Gatworth walked to an open window and looked down on the littered Mall. "But everybody just dropped everything as soon as you opened Force Command. Kurt Fawzi's not been back here since."  "Well, you're here. Lester Dawes and Lorenzo Menardes are here. Why don't you just take over. Kurt Fawzi couldn't care less what you do; he's forgotten he is mayor of Litchfield. He's forgotten there is a Litchfield."  "Well, I don't like to just move into the mayor's office and take over...."  From somewhere below, a submachine gun hammered. There were yells, pistol shots, and the submachine gun hammered again, a couple of short bursts.  "Some of the farm-tramps who can't get jobs, trying to steal something to eat, I suppose," Conn commented. Gatworth was frowning thoughtfully. He'd only need one more, very slight, push. "Why don't you talk to Wade Lucas. He's got brains, and he's honest--nobody but an honest man would have made himself as unpopular as Lucas has. If you pretend to be disillusioned with this Merlin business it might help convince him."  "He was blaming you and your father for what's been going on here in the last two weeks. Yes. He'd help get things straightened out."  At home, he found his mother simply dazed. She was happy to see him, and solicitous about his and his father's health. It seemed at times, though, as if he were somebody she had never met before. Events had gotten so far beyond her that she wasn't even trying to catch up.  Flora, returning from school, stopped short when she saw him.  "Well! I hope you like what you've done!" she greeted him.  "For a start, yes."  "For a start! You know what you've done?"  "Yes. I don't know what you think I've done, though. Tell me."  "You've turned everything into a madhouse; you've sent this whole world Merlin-crazy. Look at the stock market...."  "You look at it. All I can see is a pack of lunatics playing Russian roulette with five chambers loaded out of six. Some of this so-called stock that's being peddled around isn't worth five millisols a share--Seekers for Merlin, Ltd., closed today at a hundred and seventy. You notice, there isn't any L. E. & S. being traded. If you don't believe me, talk to Lester Dawes; he'll tell you what we think of this market."  "Well, it's your fault!"  "In part it's my fault that any of these quarter-wits have any money to play the market with. They wouldn't have money enough to play a five-centisol slot machine if we hadn't gotten a little business started."  There was just a little truth to that, too. A few woolen socks were coming out from under mattresses, and a few tin cans were being exhumed in cellars, since the new flood of Federation equipment and supplies had gotten on the market. He'd seen a freshly lettered sign on Len Yeniguchi's tailor shop: QUARTER PRICE IN FEDERATION CURRENCY.  That night, however, he had one of the nightmares he used to have as a child--a dream of climbing up onto a huge machine and getting it started, and then clinging, helpless and terrified, unable to stop it as it went faster and faster toward destruction.  Klem Zareff's patrols were encountering larger outlaw bands, the result of gang mergers. They were fighting with prospecting parties, and prospecting parties were fighting one another. Much of this was making the newscasts. One battle, between two regularly chartered prospecting companies, lasted three days, with an impressive casualty list.  Public demands were growing that the Planetary Government do something about the situation; the Government was wondering what to do, or how. There were indignant questions in Parliament. Finally, the Government dragged a couple of armed ships off Mothball Row--a combat freighter like the _Lester Dawes_, and a big assault transport--and began trying to get them into commission.  And, of course, the market boom was still on. The newscasts were full of that, too. He had started worrying about _if_ a bust came; now he was worrying about what would happen _when_ it did. Another good reason for wanting to get to Koshchei and getting a hypership built; when the bust came, he and his father would want one, very badly.  In any case, it was time to begin getting an expedition ready for Barathrum Spaceport. Quite a few of the new companies had large contragravity craft, and the nascent Planetary Air Navy was approaching a state of being. He wanted to get out there before anybody else did.  Maybe if they got the hypership built soon enough, it would start a second, sound boom that would cushion the crash of the present speculative market when it came, as come it must.  He talked to Klem Zareff about borrowing a couple of the eighty-foot gunboats. Zareff's attitude was automatically negative.  "We mustn't weaken our defense-perimeter; we'd be inviting disaster. Why, this whole country in here is simply swarming with outlaws. They fired on one of our gunboats, the _Werewolf_, yesterday."  He'd heard about that; somebody had launched a missile from the ground, and the _Werewolf_ had detonated it with a counter-missile. It had probably been some legitimate prospecting company who'd taken the L. E. & S. craft for a pirate.  "And there was a battle down in the Devil's Pigpen day before yesterday."  That had been outlaws; they had been annihilated by something calling itself Seekers for Merlin, Ltd., whose stock was still skyrocketing on the Exchange. He mentioned that.  "These other prospecting companies are doing a lot of our outlaw-fighting for us, and as long as the country's full of small independent parties, the outlaws go after them and leave us alone."  "Yes, and I have my doubts about a lot of these prospecting companies, and a lot of the outlaws, too," Zareff said. "I think a lot of both are Federation agents; they're waiting till we find Merlin, and then they'll all jump us."  "Well," Conn adjusted his argument to the old Rebel's obsession, "I'll admit that, as a possibility. If so, we'll need heavier weapons than we have. This spaceport on Barathrum might be just the place to get them."  "Yes. It might. Defense armament, and stored ships' weapons. Say, if we grab that place and move all the heavy guns and missiles here, we could stand off anybody." The thought of a fight with minions of the Terran Federation seemed to have shaved ten years off his age in a twinkling. "You take the _Lester Dawes_, and, let's say, three of these gunboats. Let me see. _Goblin_, Fred Karski. And _Vampire_, Charley Gatworth. And _Dragon_, Stefan Jorisson. They're all good men. Home Guard; trained them myself."  "Aren't you coming, Colonel?"  "Oh, I'd like to, Conn, but I can't. I don't want to be away from here; no telling what might happen. But you keep in constant screen-contact; if you get into any trouble, I'll come with everything I can put into the air."   IX  Barathrum was a grim land, naked black and gray. Spines and crags of bare rock jutted up, lava-flows like black glaciers twisting among them. It was split by faults and fissures, pimpled with ash-cones. Except for the seabirds that nested among the cliffs and the few thin patches of green where seeds windblown from the mainland had taken root, it was as lifeless as when some ancient convulsion had thrust it up from the sea, Barathrum was a dead Inferno, untenanted even by the damned; by comparison, the Badlands seemed lushly fertile.  The four craft crossed above the line of white breakers that marked the division of sea and land; the gunboat _Goblin_ in the lead, her sisters, _Vampire_ and _Dragon_ to right and left and a little behind, and the _Lester Dawes_ a few miles in the rear. Fred Karski was at the _Goblin's_ controls; Conn, beside him, was peering ahead into the teleview screen and shifting his eyes from it to the map and back again.  Somebody behind him was saying that it would be a nice place to be air-wrecked. Somebody else was telling him not to joke about it. From the radio, his father was asking: "Can you see it, yet?"  "Not yet. We're on the right map-and-compass direction; we should before long."  "We're picking up radiation," Fred Karski said. "Way above normal count. I hope the place isn't hot."  "We're getting that, too," Rodney Maxwell said. "Looks like power radiation; something must be on there."  After forty years, that didn't seem likely. He leaned over to look at the omnigeiger, then whistled. If that was normal leakage from inactive power units, there must be enough of them to power ten towns the size of Litchfield.  "Something's operating there," he said, and then realized what that meant. Somebody had beaten them to the spaceport. That would be one of the new companies formed after the opening of Force Command. He was wishing, now, that he hadn't let himself be talked out of coming here first. Older and wiser heads indeed!  Fred Karski whistled shrilly into his radio phone. "Attention everybody! General alert. Prepare for combat; prepare to take immediate evasive action. We must assume that the spaceport is occupied, and that the occupants are hostile. Captain Poole, will you please make ready aboard your ship? Reduce both speed and altitude, and ready your guns and missiles at once."  "Well, now, wait a minute, young fellow," Poole began to argue. "You don't know--"  "No. I don't. And I want all of us alive after we find out, too," Karski replied.  Rodney Maxwell's voice, in the background, said something indistinguishable. Poole said ungraciously, "Well, all right, if you think so...."  The _Lester Dawes_ began dropping to the rear and going down toward the ground. Conn returned to the teleview screen in time to see the truncated cone of the extinct volcano rise on the horizon, dwarfing everything around it. Fred Karski was talking to Colonel Zareff, back at Force Command, giving him the radiation count.  "That's occupied," the old soldier replied. "Mass-energy converter going. Now, Fred, don't start any shooting unless you have to, but don't get yourself blown to MC waiting on them to fire the first shot."  The dark cone bulked higher and higher in the screen. It must be seven miles around the crater, and a mile deep; when that thing blew out, ten or fifteen thousand years ago, it must have been something to see, preferably from a ship a thousand miles off-planet. It was so huge that it was hard to realize that the jumbled foothills around it were themselves respectably lofty mountains.  When they were within five miles of it, something twinkled slightly near the summit. An instant later, the missileman, in his turret overhead, shouted:  "Missile coming up; counter-missile off!"  "Grab onto something, everybody!" Karski yelled, bracing himself in his seat.  Conn, on his feet, flung his arms around an upright stanchion and hung on. Fred's hand gave a twisting jerk on the steering handle; the _Goblin_ went corkscrewing upward. In the rearview screen, Conn saw a pink fireball blossom far below. The sound and the shock-wave never reached them; the _Goblin_ outran them. _Dragon_ and _Vampire_ were spiraling away in opposite directions. The radio was loud with voices, and a few of the words were almost printable. A gong began clanging from the command post on top of the mesa on the mainland.  "Be quiet, all of you!" Klem Zareff was bellowing. "And get back from there. Back three or four miles; close enough so they won't dare use thermonuclears. Take cover behind one of those ridges, where they can't detect you. Then we can start figuring what the Gehenna to do next."  That made sense. And get it settled who's in command of this Donnybrook, while we're at it, Conn thought. He looked into the rear and sideview screens, and taking cover immediately made even more sense. Two more fireballs blossomed, one dangerously close to the _Dragon_. Guns were firing from the mountaintop, too, big ones, and shells were bursting close to them. He saw a shell land on and another beside one of the enemy gun positions--115-mm's from the _Lester Dawes_, he supposed. He continued to cling to the stanchion, and the _Goblin_ shot straight up, and he was expecting to see the sky blacken and the stars come out when the gunboat leveled and started circling down again. The mountainside, he saw, was sending up a lightning-crackling tower of smoke and dust that swelled into a mushroom top.  Klem Zareff, on the radio, was demanding to know who'd launched that.  "We did, sir; _Dragon_," Stefan Jorisson was replying. "We had to get rid of it. We took a hit. Gun turret's smashed, Milt Hennant's dead, and Abe Samuels probably will be before I'm done talking, and if we get this crate down in one piece, it'll do for a miracle till a real one happens."  "Well, be careful how you shoot those things off," his father implored, from the _Lester Dawes_. "Get one inside the crater and we won't have any spaceport."  The _Lester Dawes_ vanished behind a mountain range a few miles from the volcano. The _Dragon_, still airborne but in obvious difficulties, was limping after her, and the _Vampire_ was covering the withdrawal, firing rapidly but with doubtful effect with her single 90-mm and tossing out counter-missiles. There was another fireball between her and the mountain. Then, when the _Dragon_ had followed the _Lester Dawes_ to safety, she turned tail and bolted, the _Goblin_ following. As they approached the mountains, something the shape of a recon-car and about half the size passed them going in the opposite direction. As they dropped into the chasm on the other side, another nuclear went off at the volcano.  When Conn and Fred left the _Goblin_ and boarded the ship, they found Rodney Maxwell, Captain Poole, and a couple of others on the bridge. Charley Gatworth, the skipper of the _Vampire_, Morgan Gatworth's son, was with them, and, imaged in a screen, so was Klem Zareff. One of the other screens, from a pickup on the _Vampire_, showed the _Dragon_ lying on her side, her turret crushed and her gun, with the muzzle-brake gone, bent upward. A couple of lorries from the _Lester Dawes_ were alongside; as Conn watched, a blanket-wrapped body, and then another, were lowered from the disabled gunboat.  "Fred, how are you and Charley fixed for counter-missiles?" Zareff was asking. "Get loaded up with them off the ship, as many as you can carry. Charley, you go up on top of this ridge above, and take cover where you can watch the mountain. Transmit what you see back to the ship. Fred, you take a position about a quarter way around from where you are now. Don't let them send anything over, but don't start anything yourselves. I'm coming out with everything I can gather up here; I'll be along myself in a couple of hours, and the rest will be stringing in after me. In the meantime, Rodney, you're in command."  Well, that settled that. There was one other point, though.  "Colonel," Conn said, "I assume that this spaceport is occupied by one of these new prospecting companies. We have no right to take it away from them, have we?"  "They fired on us without warning," Karski said. "They killed Milt, and it's ten to one Abe won't live either. We owe them something for that."  "We do, and we'll pay off. Conn, you assume wrong. This gang's been at the spaceport long enough to get the detection system working and put the defense batteries on ready. They didn't do that since this morning, and up to last evening they neglected to file claim. I'll assume they're on the wrong side of the law. They're outlaws, Conn. All the raids along the east coast; everybody's blamed them on the Badlands gangs. I'll admit they're responsible for some of it, but I'll bet this gang at the spaceport is doing most of it."  That was reasonable. Barathrum was closer to the scene of the worst outlaw depredations than the Badlands, not more than an hour at Mach Two. And nobody ever thought of Barathrum as an outlaw hangout. People rarely thought of Barathrum at all. He liked the idea. The only thing against it was that he wanted so badly to believe it.  They brought the body of Milt Hennant aboard, and Abe Samuels, swathed in bandages and immobilized by narcotic injections. A few more of the _Dragon_'s six-man crew had been injured. Jorrisson, the skipper, had one trouser leg slit to the belt and his right thigh splinted and bandaged; he took over the _Lester Dawes_' missile controls, which he could manage sitting in one place. Fred Karski and Charley Gatworth went aboard their craft and lifted out.  For a long time, nothing happened. Conn got out the plans of the volcano spaceport and the photomaps of the surrounding area. The principal entrance, the front door of the spaceport, was the crater of the extinct volcano itself. It was ringed, outside, with launching-sites and gun positions, and according to the data he had, some of the guns were as big as 250-mm. How many outlaws there were to man them was a question a lot of people could get killed trying to answer. The ship docks and shops were down on the level of the crater floor, in caverns, both natural and excavated, that extended far back into the mountain. There were two galleries, one above the other, extending entirely around the inside of the crater near the top; passages from them gave access to the outside gun and missile positions.  With a dozen ships the size of the _Lester Dawes_, about five thousand men, and a CO who wasn't concerned with trivialities like casualties, they could have taken the place in half an hour. With what they had, trying to fight their way in at the top was out of the question.  There was another way in. He had known about it from the beginning, and he was trying desperately to think of a way not to utilize it. It was a tunnel two miles long, running into some of the bottom workshops and storerooms back of the ship berths from a big blowhole or small crater at the foot of the mountain. According to the fifty-year-old plans, it was big enough to take a gunboat in, and on paper it looked like a royal highway straight to the heart of the enemy's stronghold.  To Conn, it looked like a wonderful place to commit suicide. He'd only had a short introductory course, in one semester, in military and protective robotics, just enough to give him a foundation if he wanted to go into that branch of the subject later. It was also enough to give him an idea of the sort of booby-traps that tunnel could be filled with. He knew what he'd have put into it if he'd been defending that place.  Colonel Zareff had sent one last message from Force Command when he lifted off with a flight of recon-cars. After that, he maintained a communication blackout. It was an hour and a half before he got close enough to be detected from the outlaw stronghold. Immediately, the volcano began spewing out missiles. Poole hastily took the _Lester Dawes_ ten miles down the rift-valley in sixty seconds, while Stefan Jorisson put out a nuclear-warhead missile and left it circling about where the ship had been. From their respective positions, Fred Karski and Charley Gatworth filled the airspace midway to the volcano with counter-missiles, each loaded with four rockets. There were explosions, fireballs in the air and rising cumulus clouds of varicolored smoke and dust. Only about half the enemy missiles reached the _Lester Dawes'_ former position.  When their controllers, back at the volcano, couldn't see the ship in their screens, the missiles bunched together. Immediately, Jorisson sent his missile up to join them and detonated it. Including his own, eight nuclear weapons went off together in a single blast that shook the ground like an earthquake and churned the air like a hurricane. Klem Zareff came on-screen at once.  "Now what did you do?" he demanded. "Blew the whole place up, didn't you?"  Rodney Maxwell told him. Zareff laughed. "They might just think they got the ship; all the pickups would be smashed before they could see what really happened. You're about ten miles south of that? Be with you in a few minutes."  They got a screen on for his rearview pickup. Zareff had with him a dozen recon-cars, some of them under robo-control; six gunboats followed, and behind them, to the horizon, other craft were strung out--airboats, troop carriers, and freight-scows. They could see enemy missiles approaching in Zareff's front screen; counter-missiles got most of them, and a couple of pilotless recon-cars were sacrificed. The _Lester Dawes_ blasted more missiles as they crossed the top of the mountain range. Then Zareff's car was circling in and entering at one of the ship's open cargo-ports. Zareff and Anse Dawes got out.  "Gunboats are only half an hour behind," Zareff said. "Get some screens on to them, Anse; you know the combinations. Now let's see what kind of a mess we're in here."  It was almost a miracle, the way the tottering old man Conn had seen on the dock at Litchfield when he had arrived from Terra had been rejuvenated.  The rest of the reinforcements arrived slowly, sending missiles and counter-missiles out ahead of them. Zareff began worrying about the supply; the enemy didn't seem to be running short. By 1300--Conn noted the time incredulously; the battle seemed to have been going on forever, instead of just four hours--the _Lester Dawes_ had moved halfway around the volcano and was almost due west of it, and the eight gunboats were spaced all around the perimeter. Then one stopped transmitting; in the other screens, there was a rising fireball where she had been. The radio was loud with verbal reports.  "_Poltergeist_," Zareff said, naming half a dozen names. One or two of them had been schoolmates of Conn's at the Academy; he knew how he'd feel about it later, but now it simply didn't register.  "They're launching missiles faster than we can shoot them down," he said.  "That's usually the beginning of the end," Zareff said. "I saw it happen too often during the War. We've got to get inside that place. It's a lot of harmless fun to send contragravity robots out to smash each other, but it doesn't win battles. Battles are won by men, standing with their feet on the ground, using personal weapons."  "We'll have to win this one pretty soon," Rodney Maxwell said. "The amount of nuclear energy we've been releasing will be detectable anywhere on the planet by now. The Government has a ship like the _Lester Dawes_ in commission; if this keeps on, she'll be coming out for a look."  "Then we'll have help," Captain Poole said.  "We need Government help like we need the polka-dot fever," Rodney Maxwell said. "If they get in it, they'll claim the spaceport themselves, and we'll have fought a battle for nothing."  Well, that was it, then. The spaceport was essential to the Maxwell Plan. He'd gotten seven men killed--eight, if the recon-car that was taking Abe Samuels to the hospital in Litchfield didn't make it in time--and it was up to him to see that they hadn't died for nothing. He spread the photo-map and the spaceport plans on the chart table.  "Look at this," he said.  Klem Zareff looked at it. He didn't like it any better than Conn had. He studied the plan for a moment, chewing his cigar.  "You know, it's possible they don't know that thing exists," he said, without too much conviction. "You'll be betting the lives of at least twenty men; fewer than that couldn't accomplish anything."  "I'll be putting mine on the table along with them," Conn said. "I'll lead them in."  He was wishing he hadn't had to say that. He did, though. It was the only thing he could say.  "You better pick the men to go with me, Colonel," he continued. "You know them better than I do. We'll need working equipment, too; I have no idea what we may have to take out of the way, inside."  "I won't call for volunteers," Zareff said. "I'll pick Home Guards; they did their volunteering when they joined."  "Let me pick one man, Colonel," Anse Dawes said. "I'll pick me."   X  They sent a snooper in first; it picked up faint radiation leakage from inactive power units of overhead lights, and nothing else. The tunnel stretched ahead of it, empty, and dark beyond its infrared vision. After it had gone a mile without triggering anything, the jeep followed Anse Dawes piloting and Conn at the snooper controls watching what it transmitted back. The two lorries followed, loaded with men and equipment, and another jeep brought up the rear. They had cut screen-and-radio communication with the outside; they weren't even using inter-vehicle communication.  At length, the snooper emerged into a big cavern, swinging slowly to scan it. The walls and ceiling were rough and irregular; it was natural instead of excavated. Only the floor had been leveled smooth. There were a lot of things in it, machinery and vehicles, all battered and in poor condition, dusty and cobwebbed: the spaceport junkheap. A passage, still large enough for one of the gunboats, led deeper into the mountain toward the crater. They sent the snooper in and, after a while, followed.  They came to other rectangular, excavated caverns. On the plans, they were marked as storerooms. Cases and crates, indeterminate shrouded objects; some had never been disturbed, but here and there they found evidence of recent investigation.  Beyond was another passage, almost as wide as the Mall in Litchfield; even the _Lester Dawes_ could have negotiated it. According to the plans, it ran straight out to the ship docks and the open crater beyond. Anse turned the jeep into a side passage, and Conn recalled the snooper and sent it ahead. On the plan, it led to another natural cavern, half its width shown as level with the entrance. The other half was a pit, marked as sixty feet deep; above this and just under the ceiling, several passages branched out in different directions.  The snooper reported visible light ahead; fluoroelectric light from one of the upper passages, and firelight from the pit. The air-analyzer reported woodsmoke and a faint odor of burning oil. He sent the snooper ahead, tilting it to look down into the pit.  A small fire was burning in the center; around it, in a circle, some hundred and fifty people, including a few women and children, sat, squatted or reclined. A low hum of voices came out of the soundbox.  "Who the blazes are they?" Anse whispered. "I can't see any way they could have gotten down there."  They were in rags, and they weren't armed; there wasn't so much as a knife or a pistol among them. Conn motioned the lorries and the other jeep forward.  "Prisoners," he said. "I think they were hauled down here on a scow, shoved off, and left when the fighting started. Cover me," he told the men in the lorries. "I'm going down and talk to them."  Somebody below must have heard something. As Anse took the jeep over and started floating it down, the circle around the fire began moving, the women and children being pushed to the rear and the men gathering up clubs and other chance weapons. By the time the jeep grounded, the men in the pit were standing defensively in front of the women and children.  They were all dirty and ragged; the men were unshaven. There was a tall man with a grizzled beard, in greasy coveralls; another man with a black beard and an old Space Navy uniform, his head bandaged with a dirty and blood-caked rag; another in the same uniform, wearing a cap on which the Terran Federation insignia had been replaced by the emblem of Transcontinent & Overseas Shiplines and the words CHIEF. And beside the tall man with the gray beard, was a girl in baggy trousers and a torn smock. Like the others, she was dirty, but in spite of the rags and filth, Conn saw that she was beautiful. Black hair, dark eyes, an impudently tilted nose.  They all looked at him in hostility that gradually changed to perplexity and then hope.  "Who are you?" the tall man with the gray beard asked. "You're none of this gang here."  "Litchfield Exploration & Salvage; I'm Conn Maxwell."  That meant nothing; none of them had been near a news-screen lately.  "What's going on topside?" the man with the bandaged head and the four stripes on his sleeve asked. "There was firing, artillery and nuclears, and they herded us down here. Have you cleaned the bloody murderers out?"  "We're working on it," Conn said. "I take it they aren't friends of yours?"  Foolish Question of the Year; they all made that evident.  "They took my ship; they murdered my first officer and half my crew and passengers...."  "They burned our home and killed our servants," the girl said. "They kidnapped my father and me...."  "They've been keeping us here as slaves."  "It's the Blackie Perales gang," the tall man with the gray beard said. "They've been making us work for them, converting a blasted tub of a contragravity ship into a spacecraft. I beg your pardon, Captain Nichols; she was a fine ship--for her intended purpose."  "You're Captain Nichols?" Anse Dawes exclaimed. "Of the _Harriet Barne_?"  "That's right. The _Harriet Barne's_ here; they've been making us work on her, to convert her to an interplanetary craft, of all idiotic things."  "My name's Yves Jacquemont," the man with the gray beard said. "I'm a retired hyperspace maintenance engineer; I had a little business at Waterville, buying, selling and rebuilding agricultural machinery. This gang found out about me; they raided and burned our village and carried me and my daughter, Sylvie, away. We've been working for them for the last four months, tearing Captain Nichols' ship down and armoring her with collapsium."  "How many pirates are there here?"  That started an argument. Nobody was quite sure; two hundred and fifty seemed to be the highest estimate, which Conn decided to play safe by accepting.  "You get us out of here," Yves Jacquemont was saying. "All we want is a chance at them."  "How about arms? You can't do much with clubs and fists."  "Don't worry about that; we know where to get arms. The treasure house, where they store their loot. There's plenty of arms and ammunition, and anything else you can think of. They've used us to help stow the stuff; we know where it is."  "Anse, you remember those scows we saw, in the big room before we came to the broad passage? Take four men in the jeep; have them lift two of them and bring them here. Then, you get out to the end of the tunnel and call the _Lester Dawes_. Tell them what's happened, tell them they can get gunboats all the way in, and wait to guide them when they arrive."  When Anse turned and climbed into the jeep, he asked Yves Jacquemont: "Why does this Perales want an interplanetary ship?"  "He's crazy!" Jacquemont swore. "Paranoid; megalomaniac. He talks of organizing all the pirates and outlaws on the planet into one band and making himself king. He's heard that there are Space Navy superweapons on Koshchei--I suppose there are, at that--and he wants to get a lot of planetbusters and hellburners and annihilators." He lowered his voice. "Captain Nichols and I were going to fix up something that'd blow the _Harriet Barne_ up as soon as he got her out of atmosphere."  He talked for a while to Jacquemont and his daughter Sylvie, and to Nichols and the chief engineer, whose name was Vibart. There was evidently nothing else at the spaceport of which a spaceship could be built, but there were foundries and rolling-mills and a collapsed-matter producer. The _Harriet Barne_ was gutted, half torn down, and half armored with new collapsium-plated sheet steel. It might be possible to continue the work on her and take her to space.  Then the two scows floated over the top of the pit and began letting down. They got the prisoners into them, the combat-effective men in one and the women and children in the other. At the top, he took over the remaining jeep, getting Jacquemont, his daughter, and the two contragravityship officers in with him.  "Up to the top," Jacquemont said. "Take the middle passage, and turn right at the next intersection."  As they approached the section where the pirates stored their loot, the sound of guns and explosions grew louder, and they began picking up radio and screen signals, all of which were scrambled and incomprehensible. The pirates, in different positions, talking among themselves. With all that, it ought to be safe to use their own communication equipment; nobody would notice it.  The treasure room looked like a giant pack rat's nest. Cases and crates of merchandise, bales, boxes, barrels. Machinery. Household and industrial robots. The prisoners piled out of the two scows and began rummaging. Somebody found a case of cigarettes and smashed it open; in a moment, cartons were being tossed around and opened, and everybody was smoking. The pirates evidently hadn't issued any tobacco rations to their prisoners.  And they found arms and ammunition, began ripping open cases, handing out rifles, pistols, submachine guns. The prisoners grabbed them even more hungrily than the cigarettes. Sylvie Jacquemont took charge of the ammunition; she had three men opening boxes for her, while she passed out boxes of cartridges and made sure that everybody had ammunition to fit their weapons. A ragged man who might have been a farm-tramp or a rich planter before his capture had gotten a bale of cloth open and was tossing rags around while the chief engineer inspected weapons and showed people how to clean out the cosmoline and fill their spare magazines.  Conn collected a few of his own party.  "Let's look these robots over," he said. "Find about half a dozen we can load with blasting explosive and send ahead of us on contragravity."  They found several--an electric-light servicer, a couple of wall-and-window washers, a serving-robot that looked as if it had come from a restaurant, and an all-purpose robo-janitor. In the passage outside, they began loading the lorries with bricks of ionite and packages of cataclysmite, packing all the scrap-iron and other junk around the explosives that they could. As soon as they had weapons, the prisoners came swarming out, making more noise than was necessary and a good deal more than was safe. Sylvie Jacquemont, with a submachine gun slung from one shoulder and a canvas bag of spare magazines from the other, came over to see what he was doing.  "Well, look what you're doing to him!" she mock-reproached. "That's a dirty trick to play on a little robot!"  He grinned at her. "You and my mother would get along. She always treats robots like people."  "Well, they are, sort of. They aren't alive--at least, I don't think they are--but they do what you tell them, and they learn tricks, and they have personalities."  That was true. He didn't think robots were alive, either, though biophysics professors tended to become glibly evasive when pinned down to defining life. Robots could learn, if you used the term loosely enough. And any robot with more than five hundred hours service picked up a definite and often exasperating personality.  "I've been working with them, and tearing them down and fixing them, ever since I was in pigtails," she added.  The half-dozen natural leaders among the prisoners--Jacquemont and his daughter, the two _Harriet Barne_ officers, and a couple of others--bent over the photoprinted plans Conn had, located their position, and told him as much as they could about what lay ahead. Sylvie Jacquemont could handle robots; she would ride in the front seat of the jeep while he piloted. Vibart, the chief engineer, and Yves Jacquemont would ride behind. Nichols would ride in the scow with the fighting men. One lorry of his own party would follow the jeep; the other would bring up the rear.  He snapped on the screen and punched the ship combination. Stefan Jorisson appeared in it.  "Hi, Conn! You all right?" He raised his voice. "Conn's on-screen!"  His father appeared at Jorisson's shoulder and, a moment later, Klem Zareff.  "Well, we're in, all right," he said. "We just picked up an army, too." He swung the jeep to get the crowd in the pickup, explaining who they were. "Did you hear from Anse?"  "Yes, he just screened in," Rodney Maxwell said. "He said a gunboat can get in."  "That's right; clear into the crater."  "Well, we're going to put three of them inside," Zareff told him. "_Werewolf_, _Zombi_, and _Dero_. And a troop carrier with fifty men; flamethrowers, portable machine guns, bomb-launchers; regular special-weapons section. What can you do where you are?"  "Here? Nothing. We're going to work around to the other side of the crater, and then find a vertical shaft and go up topside and make as much disturbance as we can."  "That's it!" Zareff approved. "Pull them off balance; as soon as we get in, we'll go straight to the top. Look for us in about an hour; it's going to take time getting to the tunnel-mouth without being spotted from above."  He lifted the jeep and started off; the lorry, and the scows and the other lorry followed; the snooper and the bomb-robots went ahead like a pack of hunting dogs. They went through great chambers, dark and silent and bulking with dusty machines. Jacquemont explained that the prisoners had never gotten into this section; the _Harriet Barne_ was a mile or so to their right. Conn turned left, when the noise of firing from outside became plainer. A foundry. A machine-shop which seemed to have been abandoned in the middle of some rush job that hadn't really been necessary. They came to a place even the snooper couldn't enter, choked to the ceiling with dead vegetation, hydroponic seed-plants that had been left untended to grow wild and die. They emerged into outside light, in vast caves a mile high and open onto the crater, and looked across the floor that had been leveled and vitrified to the other side, three and a half miles away.  He didn't know whether to be more awed by the original eruption that had formed the crater or by the engineering feat of carving these docks and ship-berths, big enough for the hugest hyperspaceship, into it.  At first, he had been afraid of getting into position too soon before the task force from outside could profit by the diversion. Then he began to worry about the time it was taking to get halfway around the crater. He could hear artillery thundering continuously above. Except at the very beginning of the battle, there had been little gunfire. He wondered if both sides were running out of lift-and-drive missiles, or if the fighting had gotten too close for anybody to risk using nuclear weapons.  He was also worrying about the women and children among the released prisoners.  "Why did the pirates bother with them?" he asked Sylvie.  "They used the women and some of the old men to do housekeeping chores for them," she said. "Mostly, though, they were hostages; if the men didn't work, Perales threatened to punish the women and children. I wasn't doing any housework; I'm too good a mechanic. I was helping on the ship."  "Well, what'll I do with them when the fighting starts? I can't take them into battle."  "You'll have to; it'll be the safest place for them. You can't leave them anywhere and risk having them recaptured."  "That means we'll have to detach some men to cover them, and that'll cut our striking force down." He whistled at the sound-pickup of his screen and told his father about it. "What do I do with these people, anyhow?"  "You're the officer in command, Conn," his father told him. "Your decision. How soon can you attack? We're almost through to the crater."  "There's a vertical shaft right above us, and a lot of noise at the top. We'll send up a couple of bomb-robots to clear things at the shaft-head and follow with everything we have."  "Noncombatants and all?"  He nodded. "Only thing we can do." An old quotation occurred to him. "'If you want to make an omelet, you have to break eggs.'"  He wondered who'd said that in the first place. One of the old Pre-Atomic conquerors; maybe Hitler. No, Hitler would have said, "If you want to make sauerkraut, you have to chop cabbage." Maybe it was Caesar.  "We'd better send Gumshoe Gus up, first," Sylvie suggested.  "You handle him. Take a quick look around, and then pull him back. We'll need him later." It was the first time he'd ever caught himself calling a robot "him," instead of "it." He thought for a second, and added: "Give your father and Mr. Vibart the controls for the two window-washers; you handle the snooper."  He gave more instructions: Yves Jacquemont to turn his bomb-robot right, Vibart to turn his left; the two lorries to follow the jeep up the shaft, the scows to follow. Then he leaned back and looked at the screens that had been rigged under the top of the jeep. A circle of light appeared in one, growing larger and brighter as the snooper approached the top of the shaft; two more came on as the bomb-robots followed.  "All right; follow me," he said into the inter-vehicle radio, and started the jeep slowly up the shaft.  The snooper popped out of the shaft, onto a gallery that had been cut into the solid rock, fifty feet high and a hundred and fifty across, with a low parapet on the outside and the mile-deep crater beyond. There were a few grounded aircars and lorries in sight, and a medium airboat rested a hundred or so feet on the right of the shaft-opening. Fifteen or twenty men were clustered around it, with a lifter loaded with ammunition. They looked like any crowd of farm-tramps. Suddenly, one of them saw the snooper, gave a yell, and fired at it with a rifle. Sylvie pulled it back into the shaft; her father and the chief engineer sent the two bomb-robots up onto the gallery. The right-hand robot sped at the airboat; the last thing Conn saw in its screen was a face, bearded and villainous and contorted with fright, looking out the pilot's window of the airboat. Then it went dead, and there was a roar from above. On the other side, several men were firing straight at the pickup of the other robot; it went dead, too, and there was a second explosion.  In the communication screen, somebody was yelling, "Give them another one for Milt Hennant!" and his father was urging him to get in fast, before they recovered.  In peace or war, screen communication was a wonderful thing. The only trouble was that it let in too many kibitzers.  The gallery, when the jeep emerged onto it, was empty except for casualties, a few still alive. The side of the airboat was caved in; the lifter-load of ammunition had gone up with the bomb. He moved the jeep to the right of the shaft and waited for the vehicles behind him, suffering a brief indecision.    _Never divide your force in the presence of the enemy._  There had been generals who had done that and gotten away with it, but they'd had names like Foxx Travis and Robert E. Lee and Napoleon--Napoleon; that was who'd made that crack about omelets! They'd known what they were doing. He was playing this battle by ear.  There was a lot of shouting ahead to the right. That meant live pirates, a deplorable situation which ought to be corrected at once. The communication screen was noisy, now; his father had gotten to the top gallery with the three gun cutters, and was meeting resistance. He formed his column, his jeep and one of the lorries in front, the scows next, and the second lorry behind, and started around the gallery counterclockwise, the snoopers and the three remaining bomb-robots ahead. They began running into resistance almost at once.  Bullets spatted on the armor glass in front of him, spalling it and blotching it with metal until he found that he could steer better by the show-back of his view-pickup. He used that until the pickup was shot out. Then his father began wanting to know, from the communication screen, what was going on and where he was. A bomb or something went off directly under the jeep, bouncing it almost to the ceiling; he found that it was impossible to lift it again after it settled to the floor of the gallery, and they all piled out to fight on foot. Sommers and his gang from the number one lorry were also afoot; their vehicle had been disabled. He saw them lifting wounded into one of the scows.  They blew up the light-service robot to clear a nest of pirates who had taken cover ahead of them. They sent the robo-janitor up a side passage and exploded it in a missile-launching position on the outside of the mountain; that produced a tremendous explosion. They began running out of cartridges, and had to stop and glean more from enemy casualties. They expended their last bomb-robot, the restaurant server, to break up another pirate resistance point.  At length he found himself, with Sylvie and her father and one of the Home Guardsmen from Sommers' lorry, lying behind an aircar somebody had knocked out with a bazooka, with two dead pirates for company and a dozen distressingly live ones ahead behind an improvised barricade. Behind, there was frantic firing; the rear-guard seemed to have run into trouble, probably from some gang that had come down from the upper level. He wondered what his father was doing with the gunboats; since abandoning the jeep, he had lost his only means of contact.  Suddenly, the men in front jumped up from their barricade and came running toward him. Been reinforced, now they're counterattacking. His rifle was empty; he drew his pistol and shot one of them, and then he saw that they were throwing up their hands and yelling for quarter. This was something new.  He looked around quickly, to make sure none of the liberated prisoners except Jacquemont and his daughter were around, and then called to a couple of his own men to come up and help him. While they were relieving the pirates of their pistol belts and cartridge bandoliers, more came up, their hands over their heads, herded by a combat car from which Tom Brangwyn covered them with a pair of 12-mm machine guns. Tom hadn't put in an appearance before he had taken his commando force into the tunnel; he hadn't even known the chief of Company Police was on Barathrum.  "Well, nice seeing you," he greeted. "How did you get in?"  "Over the top," Brangwyn told him. "Everything's caved in on the other side. We have a quarter of the top gallery, and half of this one. Your father's cleaning up above. Klem's got some men working along the outside."  Sylvie was tugging at his arm. "Hey, look! Look at that!" she was clamoring. "Who's she belong to?"  He looked; the _Lester Dawes_ was coming over the edge of the crater.  "She's ours," he said. "It's all over but the mopping up. And counting the egg breakage."   XI  The shooting died down to occasional rattles of small arms, usually followed by yells for quarter. An explosion thundered from across the crater. The _Lester Dawes_ fired her big guns a few times. A machine gun stuttered. A pistol banged, far away. It took two hours before all the pirates had been hunted out of hiding and captured, or killed if found by their former captives, who were accepting no surrender whatever.  Blackie Perales had been one of the latter; he had been found, his clothes in rags and covered with dirt and grease, hiding under a machine in one of the shops back of the dock in which the _Harriet Barne_ was being rebuilt. He had tried to claim that he was one of the pirates' prisoners who had eluded the roundup at the beginning of the battle and had been hiding there since. As soon as the real prisoners saw and recognized him, they had fallen upon him and clubbed, kicked and stamped him out of any resemblance to humanity. At that, what he got was probably only a fraction of what he deserved.  The egg breakage had been heavy, and not at all confined to the bad eggs. A third gunboat, the _Banshee_, had been destroyed with all hands during the final attack from outside; in addition, a dozen men had been killed during the fighting in the galleries. Everybody was shocked, except Klem Zareff, who had been in battles before. He was surprised that the casualties had been so light.  At first glance, the spaceport looked like a handsome prize of victory. The docks and workshops were all in good condition; at worst, they only needed cleaning up. There was a collapsium plant, with its own mass-energy converter. There were foundries and machine-shops and forging-shops and a rolling-mill, almost completely robotic. At first, Conn thought that it might be possible to build a hyperdrive ship here, without having to go to Koshchei at all.  Closer examination disabused him of this hope. There was nothing of which the framework of a ship could be built, and no way of producing heavy structural steel. The rolling-mill was good enough to turn out eighth-inch sheet material which when plated with a few micromicrons of collapsium would be as good as a hundred feet of lead against space-radiations, but that was the ship's skin. A ship needed a skeleton, too. The only thing to do was go on with the _Harriet Barne_.  It was sunset before he finished his tour of inspection and let his jeep down in a vehicle hall off the lower gallery outside what had originally been the spaceport officers' club. It was crowded, and a victory celebration seemed to be getting under way. He saw his father with Yves Jacquemont, Sylvie, Tom Brangwyn, and Captain Nichols. Nichols had gotten clean clothes from the pirates' store of loot, and had bathed and shaved. So had Jacquemont, though he had contented himself with trimming his beard. It took him a second or so to recognize the young lady in feminine garb as his erstwhile battle comrade, Sylvie.  "Well, our pay goes on from the day we were captured," Nichols was saying. "My instructions are to resume command of the ship. Tomorrow, they're sending a party out to go over her."  Conn stopped short. "What's this about the ship?"  "Captain Nichols was in screen contact with his company's office in Storisende," Rodney Maxwell said. "They're continuing him in command of her."  "But ... but we took that ship! We lost three gunboats and about twenty-five men...."  "She still belongs to Transcontinent & Overseas," his father said. "That's been the law on stolen property as long as there's been any law."  Of course; he should have known that. Did know it; just didn't think.  "We broke an awful lot of eggs for no omelet; fought a battle for nothing."  "Well, of course, I'm prejudiced," Sylvie said, "but I don't think getting us out of the hands of that bloodthirsty maniac and his cutthroats was nothing."  "Wiping out the Perales gang wasn't nothing, Conn," Tom Brangwyn said. "You got no idea at all how bad things were, the last couple of years."  "I know. I'm sorry." He was ashamed of himself. "But I needed a ship, and now we have no ship at all."  "A ship means something to you?" Yves Jacquemont asked.  "Yes." He told him why. "If we could get to Koshchei, we could build a hypership of our own, and get our brandy and things to markets where we could get a decent price for them."  "I know. I was in and out of Storisende on these owner-captain tramps for a couple of years before I decided to retire and settle here," Jacquemont said. "The profit on a cargo of Poictesme brandy on Terra or Baldur is over a thousand percent."  "Well, don't give up too soon," Nichols advised. "You can't keep the _Harriet Barne_, of course, but you're entitled to prize-money on her, and that ought to buy you something you could build a spaceship out of."  "That's right," Jacquemont said. "Everything else besides the frame can be made here. Look, these pirates burned me out; except for the money I have in the bank, I lost everything, home, business and all. As soon as I can find a place for Sylvie to stay, I'll come back and go to work for your company building a spaceship. And a lot of the men who were working here are farm-tramps and drifters, one job's as good as another as long as they get paid for it. And I know a few good men in Storisende--engineers--who'd be glad for a job, too."  "You think it would be all right with Mother and Flora if Sylvie stayed with us?" Conn asked.  "Of course it would; they'd be glad to have her." Rodney Maxwell turned to Yves Jacquemont. "Let's consider that fixed up. Now, suppose you and I go into Storisende, and...."  The Transcontinent & Overseas people arrived at Barathrum Spaceport the next morning; a rear-rank vice-president, a front-rank legal-eagle, and three engineers. They were horrified at what they saw. The _Harriet Barne_ had been gutted. Bulkheads and decks had been ripped out and relocated incomprehensibly; the bridge and the control room under it were gone; she had been stripped to her framework, and the whole underside was sheathed in shimmering collapsium.  "Great Ghu!" the vice-president almost howled. "That isn't _our_ ship!"  "That's the _Harriet Barne_," her captain said. "She looks a little ragged now, but--"  "You helped these pirates do this to her?"  "If I hadn't, they'd have cut my throat and gotten somebody else to help them. My throat's more valuable to me than the ship is to you; I can't get anybody to build me a new one."  "Well, understand," one of the engineers said, "they were converting her into an interplanetary ship. It wouldn't cost much to finish the job."  "We need an interplanetary ship like we need a hole in the head!" The vice-president turned to Rodney Maxwell. "Just how much prize-money do you think you're entitled to for this wreck?"  "I wouldn't know; that's up to Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong. Up to the court, if we can settle it any other way."  "You mean you'd litigate about this?" the lawyer demanded, and began to laugh.  "If we have to. Look, if you people don't want her, sign her over to Litchfield Exploration & Salvage. But if you do want her, you'll have to pay for her."  "We'll give you twenty thousand sols," the lawyer said. "We don't want to be tightfisted. After all, you fought a gang of pirates and lost some men and a couple of boats; we have some moral obligation to you. But you'll have to realize that this ship, in her present state, is practically valueless."  "The collapsium on her is worth twice that, and the engines are worth even more," Jacquemont said. "I worked on them."  The discussion ended there. By midafternoon, Luther Chen-Wong, the junior partner of the law firm, arrived from Storisende with a couple of engineers of his own. Reporters began arriving; both sides were anxious to keep them away from the ship. Conn took care of them, assisted by Sylvie, who had rummaged an even more attractive costume out of what she called the loot-cellar. The reporters all used up a lot of film footage on her. And the Fawzis' Office Gang arrived from Force Command, bitterly critical of the value of the spaceport against its cost in lives and equipment. Brangwyn and Zareff returned to Force Command with them. A Planetary Air Patrol ship arrived and removed the captured pirates. The liberated prisoners were airlifted to Litchfield.  The third day after the battle, Conn and his father and Sylvie and her father flew to Litchfield. To Conn's surprise, Flora greeted him cordially, and Wade Lucas, rather stiffly, congratulated him. Maybe it was as Tom Brangwyn had said; he hadn't been on Poictesme in the last four or five years and didn't know how bad things had gotten. His mother seemed to think he had won the Battle of Barathrum single-handed.  He was even more surprised and gratified that Flora made friends with Sylvie immediately. His mother, however, regarded the engineer's daughter with badly concealed hostility, and seemed to doubt that Sylvie was the kind of girl she wanted her son getting involved with. Outwardly, of course, she was quite gracious.  Rodney Maxwell and Yves Jacquemont flew to Storisende the next morning, both more optimistic about finding a ship than Conn thought the circumstances warranted. Conn stayed at home for the next few days, luxuriating in idleness. He and Sylvie tore down his mother's household robots and built sound-sensors into them, keying them to respond to their names and to a few simple commands, and including recorded-voice responses in a thick Sheshan accent. All the smart people on Terra, he explained, had Sheshan humanoid servants.  His mother was delighted. Robots that would answer when she spoke to them were a lot more companionable. She didn't seem to think, however, that Sylvie's mechanical skills were ladylike accomplishments. Nice girls, Litchfield model, weren't quite so handy with a spot-welder. That was what Conn liked about Sylvie; she was like the girls he'd known at the University.  They were strolling after dinner, down the Mall. The air was sharp and warned that autumn had definitely arrived; the many brilliant stars, almost as bright as the moon of Terra, were coming out in the dusk.  "Conn, this thing about Merlin," she began. "Do you really believe in it? Ever since Dad and I came to Poictesme, I've been hearing about it, but it's just a story, isn't it?"  He was tempted to tell her the truth, and sternly put the temptation behind him.  "Of course there's a Merlin, Sylvie, and it's going to do wonderful things when we find it."  He looked down the starlit Mall ahead of him. Somebody, maybe Lester Dawes and Morgan Gatworth and Lorenzo Menardes, had gotten things finished and cleaned up. The pavement was smooth and unbroken; the litter had vanished.  "It's done wonderful things already, just because people started looking for it," he said. "Some of these days, they're going to realize that they had Merlin all along and didn't know it."  There was a faint humming from somewhere ahead, and he was wondering what it was. Then they came to the long escalators, and he saw that they were running.  "Why, look! They got them fixed! They're running!"  Sylvie grinned at him and squeezed his arm.  "I get you, chum," she said. "Of course there's a Merlin."  Maybe he didn't have to tell her the truth.  When they returned to the house, his mother greeted him:  "Conn, your father's been trying to get you ever since you went out. Call him, right away; Ritz-Gartner Hotel, in Storisende. It's something about a ship."  It look a little time to get his father on-screen. He was excited and happy.  "Hi, Conn; we have one," he said.  "What kind of a ship?"  "You know her. The _Harriet Barne_."  That he hadn't expected. Something off Mothball Row that would have to be flown to Barathrum and torn down and completely rebuilt, but not the one that was there already, partly finished.  "How the dickens did you wangle that?"  "Oh, it was Yves' idea, to start with. He knew about her; the T. & O.'s been losing money on her for years. He said if they had to pay prize-money on her and then either restore her to original condition or finish the job and build a spaceship they didn't want, it would almost bankrupt the company. They got up as high as fifty thousand sols for prize-money and we just laughed at them. So we made a proposition of our own.  "We proposed organizing a new company, subsidiary to both L. E. & S. and T. & O., to engage in interplanetary shipping; both companies to assign their equity in the _Harriet Barne_ to the new company, the work of completing her to be done at our spaceport and the labor cost to be shared. This would give us our spaceship, and get T. & O. off the hook all around. Everybody was for it except the president of T. & O. Know anything about him?"  Conn shook his head. His father continued:  "Name's Jethro Sastraman. He could play Scrooge in _Christmas Carol_ without any makeup at all. He hasn't had a new idea since he got out of college, and that was while the War was still going on. 'Preposterous; utterly visionary and impractical,'" his father mimicked. "Fortunately, a majority of the big stockholders didn't agree; they finally bullied him into agreeing. We're calling the new company Alpha-Interplanetary, we have an application for charter in, and that'll go through almost automatically."  "Who's going to be the president of this new company?"  "You know him. Character named Rodney Maxwell. Yves is going to be vice-president in charge of operations; he's flying to Barathrum tomorrow or the next day with a gang of technicians we're recruiting. T. & O. are giving us Clyde Nichols and Mack Vibart, and a lot of men from their shipyard. I'm staying here in Storisende; we're opening an office here. By this time next week, we're all going to wish we'd been born quintuplets."  "And Conn Maxwell, I suppose, will be an influential non-office-holding stockholder?"  "That's right. Just like in L. E. & S."   XII  He found Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes and a score of workmen making a survey and inventory of the spaceport. Captain Nichols and four of the original crew of the _Harriet Barne_, who had shared his captivity among the pirates, had stayed to take care of the ship. And Fred Karski, with one gun-cutter and a couple of light airboats, was keeping up a routine guard. All of them had heard about the formation of Alpha-Interplanetary when Conn arrived.  The next day, Yves Jacquemont arrived, accompanied by Mack Vibart, a gang from the T. & O. shipyard, and a dozen engineers and construction men whom he had recruited around Storisende. More workers arrived in the next few days, including a number who had already worked on the ship as slaves of the Perales gang.  It didn't take Conn long to appreciate the problems involved in the conversion. Built to operate only inside planetary atmosphere and gravitation, the _Harriet Barne_ was long and narrow, like an old ocean ship; more than anything else, she had originally resembled a huge submarine. Spaceships, either interplanetary or interstellar, were always spherical with a pseudogravity system at the center. This, of course, the _Harriet Barne_ lacked.  "Well, are we going to make the whole trip in free fall?" he wanted to know.  "No, we'll use our acceleration for pseudograv halfway, and deceleration the other half," Jacquemont told him. "We'll be in free fall about ten or fifteen hours. What we're going to have to do will be to lift off from Poictesme in the horizontal position the ship was designed for, and then make a ninety-degree turn after we're off-planet, with our lift and our drive working together, just like one of the old rocket ships before the Abbott Drive was developed."  That meant, of course, that the after bulkheads would become decks, and explained a lot of the oddities he had noticed about the conversion job. It meant that everything would have to be mounted on gimbals, everything stowed so as to be secure in either position, and nothing placed where it would be out of reach in either.  Jacquemont and Nichols took charge of the work on the ship herself. Chief Engineer Vibart, with a gang of half-taught, self-taught and untaught helpers, went back to working the engines over, tearing out all the safety devices that were intended to keep the ship inside planetary atmosphere, and arranging the lift engines so that they could be swung into line with the drive engines. There was a lot of cybernetic and robotic equipment, and astrogational equipment, that had to be made from scratch. Conn picked a couple of helpers and went to work on that.  From time to time, he was able to snatch a few minutes to read teleprint papers or listen to audiovisual newscasts from Storisende. He was always disappointed. There was much excitement about the new interplanetary company, but the emphasis was all wrong. People weren't interested in getting hyperships built, or opening the mines and factories on Koshchei, or talking about all the things now in short supply that could be produced there. They were talking about Merlin, and they were all positive, now, that something found at Force Command Duplicate had convinced Litchfield Exploration & Salvage that the giant computer was somewhere off-planet.  Rodney Maxwell flew in from Storisende; he was accompanied by Wade Lucas, who shook hands cordially with Conn.  "Can you spare us Jerry Rivas for a while?" Rodney Maxwell asked.  "Well, ask Yves Jacquemont; he's vice-president in charge of operations. As an influential non-office-holding stockholder, I'd think so. He's only running around helping out here and there."  "We want him to take charge of opening those hospitals you were telling us about. Wade and I are forming a new company, Mainland Medical Materials, Ltd. Going to act as broker for L. E. & S. in getting rid of medical stores. Nobody in the company knows where to sell that stuff or what we ought to get for it."  Wade Lucas began to talk about how desperately some types of drug and some varieties of diagnostic equipment were needed. Conn had it on the tip of his tongue to ask Lucas whether he thought that was a racket, too. Lucas must have read his mind.  "I really didn't understand how much good this would do," he said. "I wouldn't have spoken so forcefully against it if I had. I thought it was nothing but this Merlin thing--"  "Aaagh! Don't talk to me about Merlin!" Conn interrupted. "I have to talk to Kurt Fawzi and that crowd about Merlin till I'm sick of the whole subject."  His father shot him a warning glance; Lucas was looking at him in surprise. He hastened to change the subject:  "I see Len made you a suit out of that material," he said to his father. "And I see you're not bulging the coat out behind with a hip-holster."  "Oh, I stopped carrying a gun; I'm a city man, now. Nobody carries one in Storisende. Won't even be necessary in Litchfield before long. Our new marshal had a regular reign of terror in Tramptown for a few days, and you wouldn't know the place. Wade, here, is acting mayor now."  They went back to talking about the new company. "You're going to have so many companies you won't be able to to keep track of them before long," Conn said.  "Well, I'm doing something about that. A holding company; Trisystem Investments, Ltd.; you're a non-office-holding stockholder in that, too."  Merlin was now a political issue. A bill had been introduced in Parliament to amend the Abandoned Property Act of 867 and nationalize Merlin, when and if discovered and regardless by whom. The support seemed to come from an extremist minority; everybody else, including the Administration, was opposed to it. There was considerable acrimony, however, on the propositions: 1) that Merlin was too important to the prosperity of Poictesme to become a private monopoly; and 2) that Merlin was too important, etc., to become a political football and patronage plum.  It was discovered, after they were half assembled, that the controls for the _Harriet Barne_ would only work while she was in a horizontal position. The whole thing had to be torn out and rebuilt. There was also trouble with the air-and-water recycling system. The _City of Nefertiti_ came in from Aton for Odin; Rodney Maxwell was almost frantic because they hadn't gotten together a cargo of medical stores from the first hospital to be opened.  "There's all sorts of stuff," he was fuming, by screen. "Stuff that's in short supply anywhere and that we could get good prices for off-planet. Get Federation sols for it, too."  "The _City of Asgard_ will be along in six months," Conn said. "You can have a real cargo assembled by then. You can make arrangements in advance to dispose of it on Terra or Baldur or Marduk."  "There are a couple of other companies interested in interplanetary ships now," his father added. "One of them had gotten four old freighters off Mothball Row, and they're tearing them down and cannibalizing them into one spaceship. That work's being done here at Storisende Spaceport. And another company has gotten title to a couple of old office buildings and has a gang at work dismantling them for the structural steel. I think they're going to build a real spaceship."  That wasn't anything to worry about either. The _Harriet Barne_ was better than half finished. There was a collapsium plant at Storisende Spaceport, but Yves Jacquemont said it was only half the size of the one at Barathrum; it would be three months before it could produce armor for one, let alone both, ships.  The crackpots were getting into the act, now, too. A spirit medium on the continent of Acaire, to the north, had produced a communication purporting to originate with a deceased Third Force Staff officer, now in the Spirit World. There was considerable detail, all ludicrous to Conn's professional ear. And a fanatic in one of the small towns on the west coast was quoting the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavadgita to prove that if Merlin were ever found, Divine vengeance in a spectacular form would fall not only on Poictesme but on the entire Galaxy.  The spaceship that was building at Storisende got into the news; on-screen, it appeared that the work was progressing rapidly. So was the work of demolishing a block of empty buildings to get girders for the second ship, on which work had not yet been started. The one under construction seemed to be of cruciform design, like an old-fashioned pre-contragravity winged airplane. The design puzzled everybody at Barathrum. Yves Jacquemont thought that perhaps there would be decks in the cross-arm which would be used when the ship was running on combined lift and drive.  "Well, till we can get a shipyard going on Koshchei and build some real spaceships, there are going to be some rare-looking objects traveling around the Alpha System. I wonder what the next one's going to look like--a flying sky-scraper?" Conn said.  "What I wonder," Yves Jacquemont replied, "is where all the old interplanetary ships got to. There must have been hundreds of them running back and forth from here to Janicot and Koshchei and Jurgen and Horvendile during the War. They must have gone somewhere."  "Couldn't they all have been fitted with Dillingham hyperdrive engines and used in the evacuation?"  "Possible. But the average interplanetary ship isn't very big; five hundred to seven-fifty feet in diameter. One of those things couldn't carry more than a couple of hundred people, after you put in all the supplies and the hydroponic tanks and carniculture vats and so on for a four- to six-month voyage. I can't see the economy of altering anything that small for interstellar work. Why, the smallest of these tramp freighters that come in here will run about fifteen hundred feet."  They didn't just disintegrate when peace broke out, that was for sure. And there certainly weren't any of them left on Poictesme. He puzzled over it briefly, then shoved it aside. He had more important things to think about.  In his spare time he was studying, along with his other work, everything he could find on Koshchei, with an intensity he had not given to anything since cramming for examinations at the University. There was a lot of it.  The fourth planet of Alpha Gartner was older than Poictesme; geologists claimed that it was the oldest thing, the sun excepted, in the system, and astrophysicists were far from convinced that it hadn't been captured from either Beta or Gamma when the three stars had been much closer together. It had certainly been formed at a much higher temperature than Janicot or Poictesme or Jurgen or Horvendile. For better than a billion years, it had been molten-hot, and it had lost most of its lighter elements in gaseous form along with its primary atmosphere, leaving little to form a light-rock crust. All that had remained had been a core of almost pure iron and a mantle that was mostly high-grade iron ore.  The same process had gone on, as it cooled, as on any Terra-size planet. After the surface had started to congeal, gases, mostly carbon dioxide and water vapor, had come up to form a secondary atmosphere, the water vapor forming a cloud envelope, condensing, and sending down rain that returned immediately as steam. Solar radiations and electric discharges broke some of that into oxygen and hydrogen; most of the hydrogen escaped into space. Finally, the surface cooled further and the rain no longer steamed off.  The whole planet started to rust. It had been rusting, slowly, for the billion or so years that had followed, and almost all the free oxygen had become locked in iron oxide. The air was almost pure carbon dioxide. It would have been different if life had ever appeared on Koshchei, but apparently the right amino acids never assembled. Some attempts had been made to introduce vegetation after the colonization of Poictesme, but they had all failed.  Men went to Koshchei; they worked out of doors in oxygen helmets, and lived in airtight domes and generated their own oxygen. There had been mines, and smelters, and blast furnaces and steel mills. And there had been shipyards, where hyperships up to three thousand feet had been built. They had all been abandoned when the War had ended; they were waiting there, on an empty, lifeless planet. Some of them had been built by the Third Fleet-Army Force during the War; most of them dated back almost a century before that, to the original industrial boom. All of them could be claimed under the Abandoned Property Act of 867, since all had been taken over by the Federation, and the original owners, or their heirs, compensated.  And there was the matter of selecting a crew. As an influential non-office-holding stockholder in all the companies involved, Conn Maxwell, of course, would represent them. He would also serve as astrogator. Clyde Nichols would command the ship in atmosphere, and act as first mate in space. Mack Vibart would be chief engineer at all times. Yves Jacquemont would be first officer under Nichols, and captain outside atmosphere. They had three real space crewmen, named Roddell, Youtsko and O'Keefe, who had been in Storisende jail as a result of a riotous binge when their ship had lifted out, six months before. The rest of the company--Jerry Rivas, Anse Dawes, Charley Gatworth, Mohammed Matsui, and four other engineers, Ludvyckson, Gomez, Karanja and Retief--rated as ordinary spacemen for the trip, and would do most of the exploration work after landing.  They got the controls put up; they would work in either position. The engines were lifted in and placed. Conn finished the robo-pilot and the astrogational computers and saw them installed. The air-and-water recycling system went in. The collapsium armor went on. In the news-screen, they saw the spaceship at Storisende still far from half finished, with swarms of heavy-duty lifters and contragravity machiners around it, and a set of landing-stands, on which the second ship was to be built, in the process of construction.  A tramp hyperspace freighter landed at Storisende, the _Andromeda_, five months from Terra, with a cargo of general merchandise. Rodney Maxwell and Wade Lucas had assembled a cargo of medicines and hospital equipment which they thought could be sold profitably. They began dickering with the owner-captain of the hypership.  A farm-tramp down in the tobacco country to the south, evidently ignorant that the former commander of the Third Force was still alive, had proclaimed himself to be the reincarnation of Foxx Travis and was forbidding everybody, on pain of court-martial and firing squad, from meddling with Merlin. And an evangelist in the west was declaring that Merlin was really Satan in mechanical shape.  The _Harriet Barne_ was finished. The first test, lifting her to three hundred miles, turning her bow-up, and taking her another thousand miles, had been a success. They brought her back and set her down in the middle of the crater, and began getting the supplies aboard. Kurt Fawzi, Klem Zareff, Judge Ledue, Franz Veltrin and the others flew over from Force Command. Sylvie Jacquemont came from Litchfield, and so did Wade Lucas, Morgan Gatworth, Lester Dawes, Lorenzo Menardes and a number of others. Neither Conn's mother nor sister came.  "I don't know what's the matter with those two," Sylvie told him. "They always seem to be scrapping with each other now, and the only thing they can agree on is that you and your father ought to stop whatever you're doing, right away. Your mother can't adjust to your father being a big Storisende businessman, and she says he'll lose every centisol he has and both of you will probably go to jail, and then she's afraid you will find Merlin, and Flora's sure you and your father are swindling everybody on the planet."  "Sylvie, I had no idea things would be like that," he told her contritely. "I wish I hadn't suggested that you stay there, now."  "Oh, it isn't so bad, so far. Your mother and I get along all right when Flora isn't there, and Flora and I get along when your mother isn't around. Mealtimes aren't much fun, though."  His father came out from Storisende, looked the ship over, and seemed relieved.  "I'm glad you're ready to get off," he said. "You know this hyperspace freighter, the _Andromeda_? Some private group in Storisende has chartered her. She's loading supplies now. I have a private detective agency, Barton-Massarra, trying to find out where's she's going. I think you'd better get this ship off, right away."  "We have everything aboard, all the supplies and everything," Jacquemont told him. "We can lift off tonight."   XIII  The ship lurched slightly. In the outside screens, the lights around, the crowd that was waving good-bye, and the floor of the crater began receding. The sound pickups were full of cheering, and the boom of a big gun at one of the top batteries, and the recorded and amplified music of a band playing the traditional "Spacemen's Hymn."  "It's been a long time since I heard that played in earnest," Jacquemont said. "Well, we're off to see the Wizard."  The lights dwindled and merged into a tiny circle in the darkness of the crater. The music died away; the cannon shots became a faint throbbing. Finally, there was silence, and only the stars above and the dark land and the starlit sea below. After a long while a sunset glow, six hours past on Barathrum, appeared in the west, behind the now appreciable curvature of the planet.  "Stand by for shift to vertical," Captain Nichols called, his voice echoing from PA-outlets through the ship.  "Ready for shift, Captain Nichols," Jacquemont reported from the duplicate-control panel.  Conn went to the after bulkhead, leaning his back against it. "Ready here, Captain," he said.  Other voices took it up. Lights winked on the control panels.  "Shifting over," Nichols said. "Your ship now, Captain Jacquemont."  "Thank you, Mr. Nichols."  The deck began to tilt, and then he was lying on his back, his feet against the side of the control room, which had altered its shape and dimensions. There was a jar as the drive went on in line with the new direction of the lift and the ship began accelerating. He got to his feet, and he and Charley Gatworth went to the astrogational computer and began checking the data and setting the course for the point in space at which Koshchei would be in a hundred and sixty hours.  "Course set, Captain," he reported to Jacquemont, after a while.  A couple of lights winked on the control panel. There was nothing more to do but watch Poictesme dwindle behind, and listen to the newscasts, and take turns talking to friends on the planet.  They approached the halfway point; the acceleration rate decreased, and the gravity indicator dropped, little by little. Everybody was enjoying the new sense of lightness, romping and skylarking like newly landed tourists on Luna. It was fun, as long as they landed on their feet at each jump, and the food and liquids stayed on plates and in glasses and cups. Yves Jacquemont began posting signs in conspicuous places:  WEIGHT IS WHAT YOU LIFT, MASS IS WHAT HURTS WHEN IT HITS YOU. WEIGHT DEPENDS ON GRAVITY; MASS IS ALWAYS CONSTANT.  His father came on-screen from his office in Storisende. By then, there was a 30-second time lag in communication between the ship and Poictesme.  "My private detectives found out about the _Andromeda_," he said. "She's going to Panurge, in the Gamma System. They have a couple of computermen with them, one they hired from the Stock Exchange, and one they practically shanghaied away from the Government. And some of the people who chartered the ship are members of a family that were interested in a positronic-equipment plant on Panurge at the time of the War."  "That's all right, then; we don't need to worry about that any more. They're just hunting for Merlin."  Some of his companions were looking at him curiously. A little later, Piet Ludvyckson, the electromagnetics engineer, said: "I thought you were looking for Merlin, Conn."  "Not on Koschchei. We're looking for something to build a hypership out of. If I had Merlin in my hip pocket right now, I'd trade it for one good ship like the _City of Asgard_ or the _City of Nefertiti_, and give a keg of brandy and a box of cigars to boot. If we had a ship of our own, we'd be selling lots of both, and not for Storisende Spaceport prices, either."  "But don't you think Merlin's important?" Charley Gatworth, who had overheard him, asked.  "Sure. If we find Merlin, we can run it for President. It would make a better one than Jake Vyckhoven."  He let it go at that. Plenty of opportunities later to expand the theme.  The gravitation gauge dropped to zero. Now they were in free fall, and it lasted twice as long as Yves Jacquemont had predicted. There were a few misadventures, none serious and most of them comic--For example, when Jerry Rivas opened a bottle of beer, everybody was chasing the amber globules and catching them in cups, and those who were splashed were glad it hadn't been hot coffee.  They made their second, 180-degree turnover while weightless. Then they began decelerating and approached Koshchei stern-on, and the gravity gauge began climbing slowly up again, and things began staying put, and they were walking instead of floating. Koshchei grew larger and larger ahead; the polar icecaps, and the faint dappling of clouds, and the dark wiggling lines on the otherwise uniform red-brown surface which were mountain ranges became visible. Finally they began to see, first with the telescopic screens and then without magnification, the little dots and specks that were cities and industrial centers.  Then they were in atmosphere, and Jacquemont made the final shift, to horizontal position, and turned the ship over to Nichols.  For a moment, the scout-boat tumbled away from the ship and Conn was back in free fall. Then he got on the lift-and-drive and steadied it, and pressed the trigger button, firing a green smoke bomb. Beside him, Yves Jacquemont put on the radio and the screen pickups. He could see the ship circling far above, and the manipulator-boat, with its claw-arms and grapples, breaking away from it. Then he looked down on the endless desert of iron oxide that stretched in all directions to the horizon, until he saw a spot, optically the size of a five-centisol piece, that was the shipbuilding city of Port Carpenter. He turned the boat toward it, firing four more green smokes at three-second intervals. The manipulator-boat started to follow, and the _Harriet Barne_, now a distant speck in the sky, began coming closer.  Below, as he cut speed and altitude, he could see the pock-marks of open-pit mines and the glint of sunlight on bright metal and armor-glass roofs, the blunt conical stacks of nuclear furnaces and the twisted slag-flows, like the ancient lava-flows of Barathrum. And, he reflected, he was an influential non-office-holding stockholder in every bit of it, as soon as they could screen Storisende and get claims filed.  A high tower rose out of the middle of Port Carpenter, with a glass-domed mushroom top. That would be the telecast station; the administrative buildings were directly below it and around its base. He came in slowly over the city, above a spaceport with its empty landing pits in a double circle around a traffic-control building, and airship docks and warehouses beyond. More steel mills. Factories, either hemispherical domes or long buildings with rounded tops. Ship-construction yards and docks; for the most part, these were empty, but on some of them the landing-stands of spaceships, like eight-and ten-legged spiders, waiting for forty years for hulls to be built on them. A few spherical skeletons of ships, a few with some of the outer skin on. It wasn't until he was passing close to them that he realized how huge they were. And stacks of material--sheet steel, deckplate, girders--and contragravity lifters and construction machines, all left on jobs that were never finished, the bright rustless metal dulled by forty years of rain and windblown red dust. They must have been working here to the very last, and then, when the evacuation elsewhere was completed, they had dropped whatever they were doing, piled into such ships as were completed, and lifted away.  The mushroom-topped tower rose from the middle of a circular building piled level on level, almost half a mile across. He circled over it, saw an airship dock, and called the _Harriet Barne_ while Jacquemont talked to Jerry Rivas, piloting the manipulator-boat. Rivas came in and joined them in the air; they hovered over the dock and helped the ship down when she came in, nudging her into place.  By the time Conn and Jacquemont and Rivas and Anse Dawes and Roddell and Youtsko and Karanja were out on the dock in oxygen helmets, the ship's airlock was opening and Nichols and Vibart and the others were coming out, towing a couple of small lifters loaded with equipment.  The airlocked door into the building, at the end of the dock, was closed; when somebody pulled the handle, it refused to open. That meant it was powered from the central power plant, wherever that was. There was a plug socket beside it, with the required voltage marked over it. They used an extension line from a power unit on one of the lifters to get it open, and did the same with the inner door; when it was open, they passed into a dim room that stretched away ahead of them and on either side.  It looked like a freight-shipping room; there were a few piles of boxes and cases here and there, and a litter of packing material everywhere. A long counter-desk, and a bank of robo-clerks behind it. According to the air-analyzer, the oxygen content inside was safely high. They all pulled off their fishbowl helmets and slung them.  "Well, we can bunk inside here tonight," somebody said. "It won't be so crowded here."  "We'll bunk here after we find the power plant and get the ventilator fans going," Jacquemont said.  Anse Dawes held up the cigarette he had lighted; that was all the air-analyzer he needed.  "That looks like enough oxygen," he said.  "Yes, it makes its own ventilation; convection," Jacquemont said. "But you go to sleep in here, and you'll smother in a big puddle of your own exhaled CO_2. Just watch what the smoke from that cigarette's doing."  The smoke was hanging motionless a few inches from the hot ash on the end of the cigarette.  "We'll have to find the power plant, then," Matsui, the power-engineer said. "Down at the bottom and in the middle, I suppose, and anybody's guess how deep this place goes."  "We'll find plans of the building," Jerry Rivas said. "Any big dig I've ever been on, you could always find plans. The troubleshooters always had them; security officer, and maintenance engineer."  There were inside-use vehicles in the big room; they loaded what they had with them onto a couple of freight-skids and piled on, starting down a passage toward the center of the building. The passageways were well marked with direction-signs, and they found the administrative area at the top and center, around the base of the telecast-tower. The security offices, from which police, military guard, fire protection and other emergency services were handled, had a fine set of plans and maps, not only for the building itself but for everything else in Port Carpenter. The power plant, as Matsui had surmised, was at the very bottom, directly below.  The only trouble, after they found it, was that it was completely dead. The reactors wouldn't react, the converters wouldn't convert, and no matter how many switches they shoved in, there was no power output. The inside telemetered equipment, of course, was self-powered. Some of them were dead, too, but from those which still worked Mohammed Matsui got a uniformly disheartening story.  "You know what happened?" he said. "When this gang bugged out, back in 854, they left the power on. Now the conversion mass is all gone, and the plutonium's all spent. We'll have to find more plutonium, and tear this whole thing down and refuel it, and repack the mass-conversion chambers--provided nothing's eaten holes in itself after the mass inside was all converted."  "How long will it take?" Conn asked.  "If we can find plutonium, and if we can find robots to do the work inside, and if there's been no structural damage, and if we keep at it--a couple of days."  "All right; let's get at it. I don't know where we'll find shipyards like these anywhere else, and if we do, things'll probably be as bad there. We came here to fix things up and start them, didn't we?"   XIV  It didn't take as long as Mohammed Matsui expected. They found the fissionables magazine, and in it plenty of plutonium, each subcritical slug in a five-hundred-pound collapsium canister. There were repair-robots, and they only had to replace the cartridges in the power units of three of them. They sent them inside the collapsium-shielded death-to-people area--transmitter robots, to relay what the others picked up through receptors wire-connected with the outside; foremen-robots, globes a yard in diameter covered with horns and spikes like old-fashioned ocean-navy mines; worker-robots, in a variety of shapes, but mostly looking like many-clawed crabs.  Neither the converter nor the reactor had sustained any damage while the fissionables were burning out. So the robots began tearing out reactor-elements, and removing plutonium slugs no longer capable of sustaining chain reaction but still dangerously radioactive. Nuclear reactors had become simpler and easier to service since the First Day of the Year Zero, when Enrico Fermi put the first one into operation, but the principles remained the same. Work was less back-breaking and muscle-straining, but it called for intense concentration on screens and meters and buttons that was no less exhausting.  The air around them began to grow foul. Finally, the air-analyzer squawked and flashed red lights to signal that the oxygen had dropped below the safety margin. They had no mobile fan equipment, or time to hunt any; they put on their fishbowl helmets and went back to work. After twelve hours, with a few short breaks, they had the reactors going. Jerry Rivas and a couple of others took a heavy-duty lifter and went looking for conversion mass; they brought back a couple of tons of scrap-iron and fed it to the converters. A few seconds after it was in, the pilot lights began coming on all over the panels. They took two more hours to get the oxygen-separator and the ventilator fans going, and for good measure they started the water pumps and the heating system. Then they all went outside to the ship to sleep. The sun was just coming up.  It was sunset when they rose and returned to the building. The airlocks opened at a touch on the operating handles. Inside, the air was fresh and sweet, the temperature was a pleasantly uniform 75 degrees Fahrenheit, the fans were humming softly, and there was running hot and cold water everywhere.  Jerry Rivas, Anse Dawes, and the three tramp freighter fo'c'sle hands took lifters and equipment and went off foraging. The rest of them went to the communications center to get the telecast station, the radio beacon, and the inside-screen system into operation. There were a good many things that had to be turned on manually, and more things that had been left on, forty years ago, and now had to be repowered or replaced. They worked at it most of the night; before morning, almost everything was working, and they were sending a signal across twenty-eight million miles to Storisende, on Poictesme.  It was late evening, Storisende time, but Rodney Maxwell, who must have been camping beside his own screen, came on at once, which is to say five and a half minutes later.  "Well, I see you got in somewhere. Where are you, and how is everything?"  Then he picked up a cigar out of an ashtray in front of him and lit it, waiting.  "Port Carpenter; we're in the main administration building," Conn told him. He talked for a while about what they had found and done since their arrival. "Have you an extra viewscreen, fitted for recording?" he asked.  Five and a half minutes later, his father nodded. "Yes, right here." He leaned forward and away from the communication screen in front of him. "I have it on." He gave the wave-length combination. "Ready to receive."  "This is about all we have, now. Views we took coming in, from the ship and a scout-boat." He started transmitting them. "We haven't sent in any claims yet. I wasn't sure whether I should make them for Alpha-Interplanetary, or Litchfield Exploration & Salvage."  "Don't bother sending in anything to the Claims Office," his father said. "Send anything you want to claim in here to me, and I'll have Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong file them. They'll be made for a new company we're organizing."  "What? Another one?"  His father nodded, grinning. "Koshchei Exploitation & Development; we've made application already. We can't claim exclusive rights to the whole planet, like the old interstellar exploration companies did before the War, but since you're the only people on the planet, we can come pretty close to it by detail." He was looking to one side, at the other screen. "Great Ghu, Conn! This place of yours all together beats everything I ever dug, Force Command and Barathrum Spaceport included. How big would you say it is? More than ten miles in radius?"  "About five or six. Ten or twelve miles across."  "That's all right, then. We'll just claim the building you're in, now, and the usual ten-mile radius, the same as at Force Command. We'll claim the place as soon as the company's chartered; in the meantime, send in everything else you can get views of."  They set up a regular radio-and-screen watch after that. Charley Gatworth and Piet Ludvyckson, both of whom were studying astrogation in hopes of qualifying as space officers after they had a real spaceship, elected themselves to that duty; it gave them plenty of time for study. Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes, with whomever they could find to help them, were making a systematic search. They looked first of all for foodstuffs, and found enough in the storerooms of three restaurants on the executive level to feed their own party in gourmet style for a year, and enough in the main storerooms to provision an army. They even found refrigerators and freeze-bins full of meat and vegetables fresh after forty years. That surprised everybody, for the power units had gone dead long ago. Then it was noticed that they were covered with collapsium. Anything that would stop cosmic rays was a hundred percent efficient as a heat insulator.  Coming in, the first day, Conn had seen an almost completed hypership bulking above the domes and roofs of Port Carpenter in the distance. He saw it again on screen from a pickup atop the central tower. As soon as the party was comfortably settled in the executive apartments on the upper levels, he and Yves Jacquemont and Mack Vibart and Schalk Retief, the construction engineer, found an aircar in one of the hangars and went to have a closer look at her.  She had all her collapsium on, except for a hundred-foot circle at the top and a number of rectangular openings around the sides. Yves Jacquemont said that would be where the airlocks would go.  "They always put them on last. But don't be surprised at anything you find or don't find inside. As soon as the skeleton's up they put the armor on, and then build the rest of the ship out from the middle. It might be slower getting material in through the airlock openings, but it holds things together while they're working."  They put on the car's lights, lifted to the top, and let down through the upper opening. It was like entering a huge globular spider's web, globe within globe of interlaced girders and struts and braces, extending from the center to the outer shell. Even the spider was home--a three-hundred-foot ball of collapsium, looking tiny at the very middle.  "Why, this isn't a ship!" Vibart cried in disgust. "This is just the outside of a ship. They haven't done a thing inside."  "Oh, yes, they have," Jacquemont contradicted, aiming a spotlight toward the shimmering ball in the middle. "They have all the engines in--Abbott lift-and-drive, Dillingham hyperdrives, pseudograv, power reactors, converters, everything. They wouldn't have put on the shielding if they hadn't. They did that as soon as they had the outside armor on."  "Wonder why they didn't finish her, if they got that far," Retief said.  "They didn't need her. They'd had it; they wanted to go home."  "Well, we're not going to finish her, not with any fifteen men," Retief said. "One man has only two hands, two feet and one brain; he can only handle so much robo-equipment at a time."  "I never expected we'd build a ship ourselves," Conn said. "We came to look the place over and get a few claims staked. When we've done that, we'll go back and get a real gang together."  "I don't know where you'll find them," Jacquemont commented. "We'll need a couple of hundred, and they ought all to be graduate engineers. We can't do this job with farm-tramps."  "You made some good shipyard men out of farm-tramps on Barathrum."  "And what'll you do for supervisors?"  "You're one. General superintendent. Mack, you and Schalk are a couple of others. You just keep a day ahead of your men in learning the job, you'll do all right."  Vibart turned to Jacquemont. "You know, Yves, he'll do it," he said. "He doesn't know how impossible this is, and when we try to tell him, he won't believe us. You can't stop a guy like that. All right, Conn; deal me in."  "I won't let anybody be any crazier than I am," Jacquemont declared, and then looked around the vastness of the empty ship with its lacework of steel. "All you need is about ten million square feet of decks and bulkheads, and air-and-water system, hydroponic tanks and carniculture vats, astrogation and robo-pilot equipment, about which I know very little, a hyperspace pilot system, about which I know nothing at all.... Conn, why don't you just build a new Merlin? It would be simpler."  "I don't want a new Merlin. I'm not even interested in the original Merlin. This is what I want, right here."  He told his father, by screen, about the ship. "I believe we can finish her, but not with the gang that's here. We'll need a couple of hundred men. Now, with the supplies we've found, we can stay here indefinitely. Should we do more exploring and claim some more of these places, or should we come home right away and start recruiting, and then come back with a large party, start work on the ship, and explore and make further claims as we have time?" he asked.  "Better come back as soon as possible. Just explore Port Carpenter, find out what's going to be needed to finish the ship and what facilities you have to produce it, and get things cleaned up a little so that you can start work as soon as you have people to do it. I'm organizing another company--don't laugh, now; I've only started promotioneering--which I think we will call Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines. Get me all the views you can of the ship herself and of the steel mills and that sort of thing that will produce material for finishing her; I want to use them in promotion. By the way, has she a name?"  "Only a shipyard construction number."  "Then suppose you call her _Ouroboros_, after Genji Gartner's old ship, the one that discovered the Trisystem."  "_Ouroboros II_; that's fine. Will do."  "Good. I'll have Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong make application for a charter right away. We'll have to make Alpha-Interplanetary one of the stockholding companies, and also Koschchei Exploitation & Development, and, of course, Litchfield Exploration & Salvage...."  It was a pity there really wasn't a Merlin. If this kept on nothing else would be able to figure out who owned how much stock in what.  They found the on-the-job engineering office for the ship in a small dome half a mile from the construction dock. Yves Jacquemont and Mack Vibart and Schalk Retief moved in and buried themselves to the ears in specifications and blueprints. The others formed into parties of three or four, and began looking about production facilities for material. There was a steel mill a mile from the construction site; it was almost fully robotic. Iron ore went in at one end, and finished sheet steel and girders and deck plates came out at the other, and a dozen men could handle the whole thing. There was a collapsium plant; there were machine-shops and forging-shops. Every time they finished inspecting one, Yves Jacquemont would have a list of half a dozen more plants that he wanted found and examined yesterday morning at the latest.  Some of them were in a frightful mess; work had been suspended and everybody had gone away leaving everything as it was. Some were in perfect order, ready to go into operation again as soon as power was put on. It had depended, apparently, upon the personal character of whoever had been in charge in the end. The nuclear-electric power unit plant was in the latter class. The man in charge of it evidently hadn't believed in leaving messes behind, even if he didn't expect to come back.  It was built in the shape of a T. One side of the cross-stroke contained the cartridge-case plant, where presses formed sheet-steel cylinders, some as small as a round of pistol ammunition and some the size of ten-gallon kegs. They moved toward the center on a production line, finally reaching a matter-collapser where they were plated with collapsium. From the other side, radioactive isotopes, mostly reactor-waste, came in through evacuated and collapsium-shielded chambers, were sorted, and finally, where the cross-arm of the T joined the downstroke, packed in the collapsium cases. The production line continued at right angles down the long building in which the apparatus which converted nuclear energy to electric current was assembled and packed; at the end, the finished power cartridges came off, big ones for heavy machines and tiny ones for things like hand tools and pocket lighters and razors. There were stacks of them, in all sizes, loaded on skids and ready to move out. Except for the minute and unavoidable leakage of current, they were as good as the day they were assembled, and would be for another century.  Like almost everything else, the power-cartridge plant was airtight and had its own oxygen-generator. The air-analyzer reported the oxygen insufficient to support life. That was understandable; there were a lot of furnaces which had evidently been hot when the power was cut off; they had burned up the oxygen before cooling. They put on their oxygen equipment when they got out of the car.  "I'll go back and have a look at the power plant," Matsui said. "If it's like the rest of this place, it'll be ready to go as soon as the reactors are started. I wish everybody here had left things like this."  "Well, we'll have to check everything to make sure nothing was left on when the main power was cut," Conn said. "Don't do anything back there till we give you the go-ahead."  Matsui nodded and set off on foot along the broad aisle in the middle. Conn looked around in the dim light that filtered through the dusty glass overhead. On either side of the central aisle were two production lines; between each pair, at intervals, stood massive machines which evidently fabricated parts for the power cartridges. Over them, and over the machines directly involved in production, were receptor aerials, all oriented toward a stubby tower, twenty feet thick and fifty in height, topped by a hemispherical dome.  "That'll be the control tower for all the machinery in here," he decided. "Anse, suppose you and I go take a look at it."  "We'll take a look at the machines," Rivas said. "Clyde, you and I can work back on the right and then come down on the other side. You know anything about this stuff?"  "Me? Nifflheim, no," Nichols said. "I know a robo-control when I see one, and I know whether it's set to receive or not."  There was a self-powered lift inside the control tower. Conn and Anse rode it to the top and got out, Anse snapping on his flashlight. It was dark in the dome at the top; instead of windows there were viewscreens all around it. Five men had worked here; at least, there were four chairs at four intricate control panels, one for each of the four production lines, and a fifth chair in front of a number of communication screens. There was a heavy-duty power unit, turned off. Conn threw the switch. Lights came on inside, and the outside viewscreens lit.  They were examining the control-panels when Conn's belt radio buzzed. He plugged it in on his helmet. It was Mohammed Matsui.  "There's one big power plant back here," the engineer said. "Right in the middle. It only powers what's in front of it. There must be another one in either wing, for the isotope plant and the cartridge-case plant. I'll go look at them. But the power's been cut off from the machines in the main building. There's four big switches, one for each production line--"  He was interrupted by a shout, almost a shriek, from somewhere. It sounded like Jerry Rivas. A moment later, Rivas was clamoring:  "Conn! What did you turn on? Turn it off, right away!"  Anse jumped to the switch, pulling it with one hand and getting on his flashlight with the other. The lights went out and the screens went dark.  "It's off."  "The dickens it is!" Rivas disputed. "There are a couple of big supervisor-robots circling around, and a flock of workers...."  At the same time, Clyde Nichols began cursing. Or maybe he was praying; it was hard to be certain.  "But we pulled the switch. It was only the lights and viewscreens in here, anyhow."  "It didn't do any good. Pull another one."  Matsui, back at the power plant, was wanting to know what was wrong. Captain Nichols stopped cursing--or praying?--and said, "Mutiny, that's what! The robots have turned on us!"  He knew what had happened, or was almost sure he did. A radio impulse had gone out, somehow, from the control tower. Something they hadn't checked, that had been left on. There was just enough current-leakage from the units in the robots to keep the receptors active for forty years. The supervisor-robots had gone active, and they had activated the rest. Once on, cutting the current from the control tower wouldn't turn them off again.  "Put the switch in again, Anse; the damage is done and you won't make it any worse."  When the screens came on, he looked around from one to another. The two supervisors, big ovoid things like the small round ones they had used in repairing the power reactors the first day, were circling aimlessly near the roof, one clockwise and the other counterclockwise, dodging obstructions and getting politely out of each other's way. At lower altitude, a dozen assorted worker-robots were moving about, and more were emerging from cells at the end of the building. Sweepers, with rotary brooms and rakes, crablike all-purpose handling robots, a couple of vacuum-cleaning robots, each with a flexible funnel-tipped proboscis and a bulging dust-sack. One tiling, a sort of special job designed to get into otherwise inaccessible places, had a twenty-foot, many-jointed, claw-tipped arm in front. It passed by and slightly over the tower, saw Clyde Nichols, and swooped toward him. With a howl, Nichols dived under one of the large machines between two production lines. A pistol went off a couple of times. That would be Jerry Rivas. Nobody else bothered with a gun on Koshchei, but he carried one as some people carry umbrellas, whether he expected to need it or not and because he would feel lost without it.  That he took in at one glance. Then he was looking at the control panels. The switches and buttons were all marked for machine-control in different steps of power-unit production. That was all for the big stuff, powered centrally. There weren't any controls tor lifters or conveyers or other mobile equipment. Evidently they were handled out in the shop, from mobile control-vehicles. He did find, on the communication-screen panel, a lot of things that had been left on. He snapped them off, one after another, snapping them on when a screen went dark. There were fifteen or twenty robots, some rather large, in the air or moving on the floor by now.  "We can't do anything here," he told Anse. "These are the shop-cleaning robots. They were the last things used here when the place closed down, and the two supervisors were probably controlled from a vehicle, and it's anybody's guess where that is now. When you threw that switch, it sent out an impulse that activated them. They're running their instruction-tapes, and putting the others through all their tricks."  Three more shots went off. Jerry Rivas was shouting: "Hey, whattaya know! I killed one of the buggers!"  There were any number of ways in which a work-robot could be shot out of commission with a pistol. All of them would be by the purest of pure luck. The next time we go into a place like this, Conn thought, we take a couple of bazookas along.  "Turn everything off and let's go. See what we can do outside."  Anse put on his flashlight and pulled the switch. They got into the lift and rode down, going outside. As soon as they emerged, they saw a rectangular object fifteen feet long settle over their aircar, let down half a dozen clawed arms, and pick it up, flying away with it. It had taped instructions to remove anything that didn't belong in the aisleway; it probably asked the supervisor about the aircar, and the supervisor didn't return an inhibitory signal, so it went ahead. Conn and Anse both shouted at it, knowing perfectly well that shouting was futile. Then they were running for their lives with one of the crablike all-purpose jobs after them. They dived under the slightly raised bed of a long belt-conveyer and crawled. Jerry Rivas fired another shot, somewhere.  The robots themselves were having troubles. They had done all the work they were supposed to do; now the supervisors were insisting that they do it over again. Uncomplainingly, they swept and raked and vacuum-cleaned where they had vacuum-cleaned and raked and swept forty years ago. The scrap-pickers, having picked all the scrap, were going over the same places and finding nothing, and then getting deflected and gathering a lot of things not definable as scrap, and then circling around, darting away from one another in obedience to their radar-operated evasion-systems, and trying to get to the outside scrap pile, and finding that the doors wouldn't open because the door openers weren't turned on, and finally dumping what they were carrying when the supervisors gave them no instructions.  One of them seemed to have dumped something close to where Clyde Nichols was hiding; if his language had been a little stronger, it would have burned out Conn's radio. Their own immediate vicinity being for the moment clear of flying robots, Conn and Anse rolled from under the conveyer and legged it between the two production lines. Immediately, three of the crablike all-purpose handling-robots saw them, if that was the word for it, and came dashing for them, followed by a thing that was mostly dump-lifter; it was banging its bin-lid up and down angrily. About fifty yards ahead, Jerry Rivas stepped from behind a machine and fired; one of the handling-robots flashed green from underneath, went off contragravity, and came down with a crash. Immediately, like wolves on a wounded companion, the other two pounced upon it, dragging and pulling against each other. That was a hunk of junk; their orders were to remove it.  The mobile trash-bin went zooming up to the ceiling, reversed within twenty feet of it and came circling back to the ground, to go zooming up again. It had gone crazy, literally. It had been getting too many contradictory orders from its supervisor, and its circuits were overloaded and its relays jammed. Rats in mazes and human-type people in financial difficulties go psychotic in very much the same way.  The two surviving all-purpose robots were also headed for a padded repair shop. They had come close enough to each other to activate their anticollision safeties. Immediately, they flew apart. Then their order to pick up that big piece of junk took over, and they started forward again, to be bounced apart as soon as they were within five feet of one another. If left alone, their power units would run down in a year or so; until then, they would keep on trying.  Soulless intelligences, indeed! Then it occurred to him that for the past however-long-it-had-been he hadn't heard from Mohammed Matsui. He jiggled his radio.  "Ham, where are you? Are you still alive?"  "I'm back at the power plant," Matsui said exasperatedly. "There's a big thing circling around here; every time I stick my head out, he makes a dive at me. I didn't know robots would attack people."  "They don't. He just thinks you're some more trash he's been told to gather up."  Matsui was indignant. Conn laughed.  "On the level, Ham. He has photoelectric vision, and a picture of what that aisle is supposed to look like. When you get out in it, he knows you don't belong there and tries to grab you."  "Hey, there's a lot of junk in here in a couple of baskets at the converter. Say I chuck one out to him; what would he do?"  "Grab it and take it away, like he's taped to do."  "Okay; wait a minute."  They couldn't see the archway to the power plant, or even the robot that had Matsui penned up, but after a few minutes they saw it soaring away, clutching a big wire basket full of broken boxes and other rubbish. It headed for the mutually repelling swarm of robots around the door that wouldn't open for them. Conn and Anse and Jerry ran toward the rear, joined by Clyde Nichols, who popped up from behind a pile of spools of electric wire. They made it just before the coffin-shaped thing that had carried off the aircar came over to investigate.  "You want to be careful back there," Matsui told them, as they started toward the temporary safety of the power plant. "All the reactor-repair robots are there; don't get _them_ on the warpath next."  Of course! There were always repair-robots at a power plant, to go into places no human could enter and live. Behind the collapsium shielding, they wouldn't have been activated.  "Let's have a look at them. What kind?"  "Standard reactor-servicers; the same we used at the administration center."  Matsui opened the door, and they went into the power plant. Conn and Matsui put on the service-power and activated the two supervisors; they, in turn, activated their workers. It was tricky work getting them all outside the collapsium-walled power-plant area; each worker had to be passed through by the supervisor inside, under Matsui's control. Because of the close quarters at which they worked inside the reactor and the converter, they weren't fitted with anticollision repulsors, and, working under close human supervision, they all had audiovisual pickups. It took some time to get adequate screens set up outside the collapsium.  Finally, they were ready. Their two supervisors went up to the ceiling, one controlled by Conn and the other by Matsui. The larger, egg-shaped shop-labor supervisors were still moving in irregular orbits; those of the workers still able to receive commands were trying to obey them, and the rest were jammed in a swarm at the other end.  First one, and then the other of the labor-boss robots were captured. They were by now at the end of what might, loosely, be called their wits. They weren't used to operating without orders, and had been sending out commands largely at random. Now they came to a stop, and then began moving in tight, guided circles; one by one, the worker robots still able to heed them were brought to ground and turned off. That left the swarm at the door. The worker-robots under direct control of the power-plant supervisors went after them, grappling them and hauling them down to where Anse and Jerry Rivas and Captain Nichols could turn them off manually.  The aircar was a hopeless wreck, but its radio was still functioning. Conn called Charley Gatworth, who called a gang under Gomez, working not far away; they came with another car.  It took all the next day for a gang of six of them to get the place straightened up. Neither Conn nor Gomez, who was a roboticist himself, would trust any of the workers or the two supervisors; their experiences out of control had rendered them unreliable. They took out their power units and left them to be torn down and repaired later. Other robots were brought in to replace them. When they were through, the power-unit cartridge plant was ready for operation.  Jerry Rivas wanted to start production immediately.  "We'll have to go back to Poictesme pretty soon," he said. "We don't want to go back empty. Well, I know that no matter what we dug up, and what we could sell or couldn't sell, there's always a market for power-unit cartridges. Electric-light units, household-appliance units, aircar and airboat units, any size at all. We run that plant at full capacity for a few days and we can load the _Harriett Barne_ full, and I'll bet the whole cargo will be sold in a week after we get in."   XV  The _Harriet Barne_ settled comfortably at the dock, the bunting-swathed tugs lifting away from her. They had the outside sound pickups turned as low as possible, and still the noise was deafening. The spaceport was jammed, people on the ground and contragravity vehicles swarming above, with police cars vainly trying to keep them in order. All the bands in Storisende seemed to have been combined; they were blaring the "Planetary Hymn";  _Genji Gartner's body lies a-moldering in the tomb, But his soul goes marching on!_  When they opened the airlock, there was a hastily improvised ceremonial barge, actually a farm-scow completely draped in red and white, the Planetary colors. They all stopped, briefly, as they came out, to enjoy the novelty of outdoor air which could actually be breathed. Conn saw his father in the scow, and beside him Sylvie Jacquemont, trying, almost successfully, to keep from jumping up and down in excitement. Morgan Gatworth to meet his son, and Lester Dawes to meet his. Kurt Fawzi, Dolf Kellton, Colonel Zareff, Tom Brangwyn. He didn't see his mother, or his sister. Flora he had hardly counted on, but he was disappointed that his mother wasn't there to meet him.  Sylvie was embracing her father as he shook hands with his; then she threw her arms around his neck.  "Oh, Conn, I'm so happy! I was watching everything I could on-screen, everything you saw, and all the places you were, and everything you were doing...."  The scow--pardon, ceremonial barge--gave a slight lurch, throwing them together. Over her shoulder, he saw his father and Yves Jacquemont exchanging grins. Then they had to break it up while he shook hands with Fawzi and Judge Ledue and the others, and by the time that was over, the barge was letting down in front of the stand at the end of the dock, and the band was still deafening Heaven with "Genji Gartner's Body," and they all started up the stairs to be greeted by Planetary President Vyckhoven; he looked like an elderly bear who has been too well fed for too long in a zoo. And by Minister-General Murchison, who represented the Terran Federation on Poictesme. He was thin and balding, and he looked as though he had just mistaken the vinegar cruet for the wine decanter. Genji Gartner's soul stopped marching on, but the speeches started, and that was worse. And after the speeches, there was the parade, everybody riding in transparent-bodied aircars, and the _Lester Dawes_ and the two ships of the new Planetary Air Navy and a swarm of gunboats in column five hundred feet above, all firing salutes.  In spite of what wasn't, but might just as well have been, a concerted conspiracy to keep them apart, he managed to get a few words privately with Sylvie.  "My mother; she didn't get here. Is anything wrong?"  "Is anything anything else? I've been in the middle of it ever since you went away. Your mother's still moaning about all these companies your father's promoting--he never used to do anything like that, and it's all too big, and it's going to end in a big smash. And then she gets onto Merlin. You know, she won't say Merlin, she always calls it, 'that thing.'"  "I've noticed that."  "Then she begins talking about all the horrible things that'll happen when it's found, and that sets Flora off. Flora says Merlin's a big fake, and you and your father are using it to rob thousands of widows and orphans of their life savings, and that sets your mother off again. Self-sustaining cyclic reaction, like the Bethe solar-phoenix. And every time I try to pour a little oil on the troubled waters, I find I've gotten it on the fire instead. And then, Flora had this fight with Wade Lucas, and of course, she blames you for that."  "Good heavens, why?"  "Well, she couldn't blame it on herself, could she? Oh, you mean why the fight? Lucas is in business with your father now, and she can't convince him that you and your father are a pair of quadruple-dyed villains, I suppose. Anyhow, the engagement is _phttt_! Conn, is my father going back to Koshchei?"  "As soon as we can round up some people to help us on the ship."  "Then I'm going along. I've had it, Conn. I'm a combat-fatigue case."  "But, Sylvie; that isn't any place for a girl."  "Oh, poo! This is Sylvie. We're old war buddies. We soldiered together on Barathrum; remember?"  "Well, you'd be the only girl, and...."  "That's what you think. If you expect to get any kind of a gang together, at least a third of them will be girls. A lot of technicians are girls, and when work gets slack, they're always the first ones to get shoved out of jobs. I'll bet there are a thousand girl technicians out of work here--any line of work you want to name. I know what I'll do; I'll make a telecast appearance. I still have some news value, from the Barathrum business. Want to bet that I won't be the working girl's Joan of Arc by this time next week?"  That cheered him. A girl can punch any kind of a button a man can, and a lot of them knew what buttons to punch, and why. Say she could find fifty girls....  He had a slightly better chance to talk to his father before the banquet at the Executive Palace that evening. They shared the same suite at the Ritz-Gartner, and even welcoming committees seldom chase their victims from bedroom to bath.  "Yes, I know all about it," Rodney Maxwell said bitterly. "I was home, a couple of weeks ago. Flora simply will not speak to me, and your mother begged me, in tears, to quit everything we're doing here. I tried to give her some idea of what would happen if I dropped this, even supposing I could; she wouldn't listen to me." He finished putting the studs in his shirt. "You still think this is worth what it's costing us?"  "You saw the views we sent back. There's work on Koshchei for a million people, at least. Why, even these two makeshift ships they're putting together here at Storisende are giving work, one way or another, to almost a thousand. Think what things will be like a year from now, if this keeps on."  Rodney Maxwell gave a wry laugh. "Didn't know I had a real Simon-pure altruist for a son."  "Pardner, when you call me that, smile."  "I am smiling. With some slight difficulty."  He didn't think well of the banquet. Back in Litchfield, Senta would have fired half her human help and taken a sledgehammer to her robo-chef for a meal like that. Even his father's camp cook would have been ashamed of it. And there were more speeches.  President Vyckhoven managed to get hold of him and Yves Jacquemont afterward, and steered them into his private study.  "Have you any real reason for thinking that Merlin might be on Koshchei?" the Planetary President asked.  "Great Ghu, no! We weren't looking for Merlin, Mr. President. We were looking for a hypership. We have one, too. Calling her _Ouroboros II_. Twenty-five-hundred-footer. We expect to have her to space in a few months. I surely don't need to tell you what that will do toward restoring planetary prosperity."  "No, of course not; a hypership of our own. But...." He looked from one to the other of them. "But I understood.... That is, Mr. Kurt Fawzi was saying...."  "Mr. Fawzi is looking for Merlin here on Poictesme. If anybody finds it, that's where it'll be found. I'm interested in getting business started again. If Merlin is found, it would help, of course." He shrugged.  "Don't look at me," Jacquemont said. "Mr. Maxwell--both of them, father and son--want some spaceships. They hired me to help build them. That's all I have in it." Then he relit the cigar the President had given him and leaned back in his chair, staring at the stuffed alcesoid head with the seven-foot hornspread above the fireplace.  Conn described the interview to his father after they were back at the hotel.  "I hope you convinced him. You know, he's afraid of Merlin. A lot of people have been saying that if Merlin's found, it should be used to determine Government policy. A few extremists are beginning to say that Merlin ought to _be_ the Government, and Jake Vyckhoven and his cronies ought to be dumped. Into the handiest mass-energy converter, preferably. You know, if anybody found Merlin and started it auditing the Planetary Treasury, Jake Vyckhoven'd be the one who'd be wanting a hypership."  Tom Brangwyn ran him down the next morning in the dining room.  "Conn, I wish you'd come along with me," he said. "Some of us are up in Kurt's suite; we'd all like to talk to you."  Somehow, he was acting as though he were making an arrest. That might have been nothing but professional habit. Conn went up to Fawzi's suite, and found Fawzi and Judge Ledue and Dolf Kellton and close to a dozen others there.  "I'm glad you could come, Conn," the Judge greeted him. Now that the defendant had arrived, the trial could begin. "I wish your father could have gotten here. I asked him to come, but he had a prior engagement. A meeting with some of the financial people here, about some company he's interested in."  "That's right; Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines."  "Interstellar!" Kurt Fawzi almost howled. "Great Ghu! Now it isn't enough to go out to Koshchei; he wants to go clear out of the Trisystem. That's what we wanted to talk about; all this nonsense you and your father are in. Merlin's right here on Poictesme. It's right at Force Command, and if your father hadn't robbed us of all our best men, like Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes, we'd have found it by now. I don't think you and your father care a hoot if we ever find Merlin or not!"  "Kurt, that's a dreadful thing to say," Dolf Kellton objected in a shocked voice.  "It's a dreadful thing to have to say," Fawzi replied, "but you tell me what Conn Maxwell or Rodney Maxwell are doing to help find it."  "Who showed you where Force Command was?" Klem Zareff asked.  Nobody could think of any good quick comeback to that.  Conn took advantage of the pause to ask, "Why do you want to find Merlin?"  "Why do we ..." Fawzi spluttered indignantly. "If you don't know...."  "I know why I do. I want to see if you do. Do you?"  "Merlin would answer so many questions," Dolf Kellton told him gently. "Questions I can't answer for myself."  "With Merlin, we could set up a legal code and a system of jurisprudence that would give everybody absolute justice," Judge Ledue said.  As if absolute justice wasn't the last thing anybody in his right senses would want; a robot-judge would have the whole planet in jail inside a month.  "We have a man who joined us after you went off to Koshchei, Conn," Franz Veltrin said. "A Mr. Carl Leibert. He's some kind of a clergyman, from over Morven way. He says that Merlin could formulate an entirely new religion, which would regenerate humanity."  "Well, I don't have any such lofty ideas," Fawzi said. "I just want Merlin to show us how to get some prosperity here; bring things back to what they were before Poictesme went broke."  "And that's what Father and I are trying to do. You're going into the woods with a book on how to chop down a tree, and no ax." Fawzi looked at him in surprise, started to say something, and thought better of it. "If we want prosperity, we need tools. Our problem is loss of markets. If we find Merlin, and tape it with everything that's happened in the forty years since it was shut down, Merlin will tell us where to find new markets. But the markets won't come to us. We'll have to do our own exporting, and we'll need ships. Now, you men have been studying about Merlin, and hunting for Merlin, all your lives. I can't add anything to what you know, and neither can my father. You find Merlin, and we'll have the ships ready when you do find it."  "Kurt, I think he has a point," somebody said.  "You're blasted well right he has," Klem Zareff put in. "If it wasn't for Conn Maxwell, you know where we'd be? Back in Litchfield, sitting around in Kurt's office, talking about how wonderful things'll be when we find Merlin, and doing nothing to find it."  "Kurt, I believe Conn is entitled to an apology," Judge Ledue ruled. "How close we are to finding Merlin I don't know, but it is due to him that we have any hope of finding it at all."  "Conn, I'm sorry," Fawzi said. "I oughtn't to have said some of the things I did. But we're all on edge; we've been having so much trouble.... Conn, it's right there at Force Command; I know it is. We've been all over the place. We have shafts sunk at each of the corners; we've used scanners, and put off echo shots. Nothing. We looked for additional passages out of the headquarters; there aren't any. But it has to be somewhere around. It just _has_ to be!"  "Maybe if I go out to Force Command with you, I might see something you've overlooked. And if I can't, I'll try to scrape up some stuff on Koshchei for you. Deep-vein scanners, that sort of thing, from the mines."  They took the _Lester Dawes_ out at a little past noon and turned south and east. Everybody aboard was happy--except Conn Maxwell. He was thinking of the years and years ahead of these trusting, hopeful old men, each year the grave of another expectation. Two hundred miles from Force Command, the _Goblin_ met them, her sides still spalled and dented from the hits she had taken in Barathrum Spaceport. When they came in sight of it, the mesa-top was deserted. Fawzi began wondering where in Nifflheim all the drilling rigs, and the seismo-trucks, were. Somebody with a pair of binoculars called attention to activity on the side of the high butte on top of which the relay station was located. Fawzi began swearing exasperatedly.  "Might be something Mr. Leibert thought of," Franz Veltrin suggested.  "Then why in blazes didn't he screen us about it?"  "Who is this Leibert?" Conn asked. "Somebody mentioned him this morning, I think."  "He joined us after you left, Conn," Dolf Kellton said. "He's a clergyman from Morven. No regular denomination; he has a sect of his own."  "Yah, he would!" Klem Zareff rumbled. "Pious fraud!"  "He's really a good man, Conn; Klem's prejudiced. He says we ought to use Merlin to show us the true nature of God, and how to live in accordance with the Divine Will. He says Merlin can teach us a new religion."  A new religion, based on Merlin; that would be good. And then the fanatics who thought Merlin was the Devil would start a holy war to wipe out the servants of Satan, and with all the combat equipment that was lying around on this planet.... For the first time since this business started, he began to feel really frightened.  An aircar came bulleting away from the butte and landed on the mesa as the _Lester Dawes_ set down. The man who met them at the head of the vertical shaft wore Federation fatigues--baggy trousers, ankle boots and long smock, dyed black. He was bareheaded, and his white hair was almost shoulder-long. He had a white beard.  "Welcome, Brothers," he greeted, a hand raised in benediction. "And who is this with you?"  His voice was high and quavery; not a good pulpit voice, Conn thought.  Kurt Fawzi introduced Conn, and Leibert grasped his hand with a grip that was considerably stronger than his voice.  "Bless you, young man! It is to you alone that we owe our thanks that we are about to find the Great Computer. Every sapient being in the Galaxy will honor your name for a thousand years."  "Well, I hadn't counted on quite that much, Mr. Leibert If it'll only help a few of these people to make a decent living I'll be satisfied."  Leibert shook his head sadly. "You think entirely in material terms, young man," he reproved. "Forget these things; acquire the higher spiritual values. The Great Computer must not be degraded to such uses; we should let it show us how to lift ourselves to a high spiritual plane...."  It went on like that, after they went down to Foxx Travis's--now Fawzi's--office, where there were silver-stoppered decanters instead of the old green-glass pitcher, and gold-plated ashtrays, and thick carpets on the floor. The man was a lunatic; he made Fawzi's office gang look frigidly sane. Furthermore, he was an ignoramus. He had no idea what a computer could or couldn't do. Anybody who could build a computer of the sort he thought Merlin was wouldn't need it, he _would_ be God.  As he talked, Conn began to be nagged by an odd sense of recognition. He'd seen this Carl Leibert before, somewhere, and somehow he was sure that the long white hair and the untrimmed beard weren't part of the picture. That puzzled him. He doubted if he'd have remembered Leibert from six years ago, almost seven, now, though a lot of itinerant evangelists showed up in Litchfield. That might have been it.  "I tell you, the Great Computer is there, in the heart of the butte," Leibert was insisting, now. "It has been revealed to me in a dream. It is completely buried. After it was made, no human touched it. The men who were here and used it in the War communicated with it only by radio."  That could be so. There were fully robotic computers, intended for use in places where no human could go and live. There was a big one on Nifflheim, armored against the fluorine atmosphere and the hydrofluoric-acid rains. But there was no point in that here, the things were enormously complicated, and military engineering of any sort emphasized simplicity--_Aaaagh!_ Was he beginning to believe this balderdash himself?  Klem Zareff fell in with him as they were going to dinner. "Revealed in a dream!" the old Rebel snorted. "One thing you can always get away with lying about is what you dream."  "You think he's lying? I think he's just crazy."  "That's what he wants you to think. Look, Conn, he knows Merlin is here; he's trying to keep us from it. That's why he shifted all that equipment over on the butte. He's working for Sam Murchison."  "I thought your theory was that the Federation had lost Merlin."  "It was, at first. It doesn't look that way to me now. It's right here at Force Command, somewhere. They don't want it found, and they're going to do everything they can to stop us. I oughtn't to have left this fellow Leibert here alone; well, I won't do that again. Get Tom Brangwyn to help me."   XVI  The voyage back to Koshchei had been a week-long nightmare. When she had been the pride and budget-wrecker of Transcontinent & Overseas Airline, the _Harriet Barne_ had accommodated two hundred first-class and five hundred lower-deck passengers, but the conversion to a spaceship had drastically reduced her capacity. The three hundred men and women who had been recruited for the Koshchei colony had been crammed into her with brutal disregard for comfort, privacy or anything else except the ability of the air-recyclers to keep them breathing. When Captain Nichols set her down at the administration building at Port Carpenter, a few had had to be carried off, but they were all alive, which made the trip an unqualified success.  The dozen leaders of the expedition were congratulating themselves on that in one of the executive offices after the first dinner at Port Carpenter. Rodney Maxwell, in Storisende, had joined them in screen-image; he was mostly listening, and sometimes contributing a remark apropos of something the rest of them had said five minutes ago.  "Our hypership," Conn was saying, "is going to have to be item two on the agenda. The first thing we need is a ship for the Poictesme-Koshchei run. By this time next year, we ought to have a thousand to fifteen hundred people here at the least. We can't haul them all on that flying sardine can."  "We'll need supplies, too. What was left here won't last forever," Nichols added.  "And you're going to have to run this at a profit," Luther Chen-Wong, who had come along for first hand experience and to help with administrative work, added. "You have a big payroll to meet, and you'll have to keep the stockholders happy. People like Jethro Sastraman and some of these Storisende bankers aren't going to be satisfied with promises and long-term prospects; they'll want dividends."  "We'll have to get claims staked on something besides Port Carpenter, too. Those ships that are building at Storisende will be finished before long," Jerry Rivas said. "If we don't get some more things claimed, the first thing you know, we'll own Port Carpenter and nothing else."  "Well, let's see what we can find in the way of a big airboat, or a small ship," Conn said. "Jerry, you can pick a party for exploring. Just zigzag around the planet and transmit in locations and views of whatever you find, and we'll send it on to Storisende."  "And don't pick anybody for your exploring party that can't be spared from anything here," Jacquemont added. "We don't want to have to chase you halfway around the world to bring back the only specialist in something yesterday at the latest."  "Are you going to come along, Conn?" Rivas asked.  "Oh, Lord, no! I'm going to be doing fifteen things at once here."  All the computer work. Finding materials to make astrogational equipment and robo-pilots. Studying hyperspace theory--fortunately, there was an excellent library here--and setting up classes, and teaching school. And keeping in touch with his father, on Poictesme. It was making him nervous not to know what sort of foolishness the older and wiser heads might be getting into.  The next morning, they began organizing work-gangs and setting up committees. Three men, two girls and about twenty robots got an open-pit iron mine started; as soon as the steel mill was ready, ore started coming in. Anse Dawes had a gang looking for something they could build a 350-foot interplanetary ship out of; Jacquemont and Mack Vibart were getting plans and specifications and making lists of needed materials. Conn gathered a dozen men and women and started classes in computer theory and practice; at the same time, he and Charley Gatworth were teaching themselves and each other hyperspatial astrogation, which was the art of tossing a ship into some everythingless noplace outside normal space-time, and then pulling her out again by her bootstraps at some other place in the normal continuum, light-years away.  Roughly, it compared to shooting hummingbirds on the wing, blindfolded, with a not particularly accurate pistol, from a mile-a-minute merry-go-round.  That was something you could only do with a computer. A human, with a slide rule, a pencil and pad, could figure it out, of course--if he had fifty-odd thousand years to do it. A good computer did it in thirty seconds. That was one difference between people and computers. The other difference was that the desirability of making a hyperspace jump would never occur to a computer, unless somebody pushed a button and taped in instructions.  They found a three-hundred-foot globular skeleton, probably the nucleus of a big hyperspace ship, and decided that was big enough for what they wanted. The entire colony got to work on it. Photoprinted plans and specifications poured out as Jacquemont and a couple of draftsmen got them up. Steel came out of the steel mill at one end while ore came in at the other. A swarm of big contragravity machines, some robotic and some human-operated, clustered around the skeletal hull like hornets building a nest.  Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines was chartered; the lawyers reported having to overcome a little more resistance than usual from the Government about that. And the bill to nationalize Merlin, which had died in committee, was resuscitated and was being debated hotly on the floor of Parliament. The Administration was now supporting it.  "Are they completely crazy?" Conn wanted to know, when he heard about that. "They pass that bill and nobody's going to look for Merlin if they know the Government will snatch it as soon as they find it."  "That is precisely Jake Vyckhoven's idea," his father replied. "I told you he was afraid of Merlin. He's getting more afraid of it every day."  He had reason to. There was a growing sentiment in favor of turning the entire Government over to the computer as soon as it was found. To his horror, Conn heard himself named as chairman of a committee that should be set up to operate it. The moderates, who had merely wanted Merlin used in an advisory capacity, were dropping out; the agitation was coming from extremists who wanted Merlin to be the whole Government, and now the extremists were developing an extreme wing of their own, who called themselves Cybernarchists and started wearing colored-shirt uniforms and greeting each other with an archaic stiff-arm salute, and the words, "Hail Merlin!"  And the followers of the gospel-shouter on the west coast were now cropping up all over the mainland, and on the continent of Acaire to the north, and another cult, non-religious, was convinced that Merlin was a living machine, with conscious intelligence of its own and awesome psi-powers, a sort of super-Golem, which, if found and awakened, would enslave the whole Galaxy. Fortunately, these two hated each other as venomously as both did the Cybernarchists, and spent most of their energies attacking each other's meetings. The news-services were beginning to publish casualty lists, some heavy enough for outpost fighting between a couple of regular armies.  One thing, it helped the employment situation. Everybody was hiring mercenaries.  "But what," Conn asked, "are the sane people doing?"  "You ought to know," his father told him. "I suspect that you have all of them on Koshchei now."  The sane people, if that was what they were, were being busy. They were putting a set of Abbott lift-and-drive engines together, and Conn's computer class was estimating the mass of the finished ship and the amount of energy needed to overcome gravitation and give it constant acceleration from Koshchei to Poictesme. They were learning, by trial and error, largely error, how to build a set of pseudograv engines. And they were putting together a hundred and one other things, all of which was good training for the time they'd be ready to start work on _Ouroboros II_.  Jerry Rivas had found a contragravity craft which seemed to have been used by some top official for business and inspection trips, had gathered a crew of non-specialists who weren't urgently needed at Port Carpenter, and set out to circumnavigate the planet. It worked just the reverse of expectation. He found a big uranium mine, with an isotope-separation plant and a battery of plutonium-breeders; that meant that Mohammed Matsui and half a dozen other nuclear-power people had to get into another boat and speed after him to see what he had really found. As soon as they landed, Rivas took off again to discover a copper mine and a complex of smelters and processing plants. That took a few more experts, or reasonable facsimiles, away from Port Carpenter. And then he found a whole city that manufactured nothing but computers and robo-controls and things like that.  Conn loaded his whole computer-theory class onto a freight-scow and took them there. By the time he landed, his father was screening him from Storisende.  "When are you going to get the ship finished?" he was asking. "Kurt Fawzi's pestering the daylights out of me. He wants that equipment you promised him."  "We're working on it. What's happened, has Carl Leibert had another revelation?"  "I don't know about that. Kurt's sure Merlin is directly under Force Command. And speaking about Leibert, Klem Zareff's been after me about him. You know I've contracted for the full-time and exclusive services of this Barton-Massarra detective agency. Well, Klem wants me to put them to work investigating Leibert."  "Yes, I know; Leibert's a Terran Federation spy. Why do you need the full-time services of the biggest private detective agency on Poictesme?"  "There have been some odd things happening. People have been trying to bribe and intimidate some of my office help. I have found microphones and screen-pickups planted around. I caught one of our clerks trying to make copies of voice-tapes. I think it's some of these other Merlin-chasing companies, trying to find out how close we are to it. Klem Zareff is recruiting more guards. But how soon are you going to get that ship built?"  "We're working on it. That's all I know, now."  He went back to work getting a classroom ready for his students. If he'd accepted that instructorship at Montevideo, he wouldn't be a full professor now, but none of the rest of this would be happening, either.  That night, he had the dream about starting the big machine and not being able to stop it again.  There was street-fighting in Storisende between the Cybernarchists and Government troops. There was a pitched battle in the west between the Armageddonists (Merlin-is-Satan) and the Human Supremacy League (Merlin-is-the-Golem), with heavy losses and claims of victory on both sides. President Vyckhoven proclaimed planet-wide martial law, and then discovered that he had nothing to enforce it with.  Luther Chen-Wong screened him from Port Carpenter. His voice was almost inaudibly low at first.  "Conn, I just had a call from Jerry and Clyde. I think we can knock off work on that ship we're building now. We won't need it."  "Have they found a ship?" If they had, it would be the first one anybody had found. "Where?"  "They haven't found _a_ ship, Conn; they've found all of them. All the ships in the Alpha System except the _Harriet Barne_ and the two they're building at Storisende. The place is marked on the map as Sickle Mountain Naval Observatory. It's just a bitty little dot, but the map was made before the evacuation started. It's where most of the troops in the system were embarked on hyperships, I think. Wait till I show you the views."  Conn put on another screen; the first view was from an altitude of five miles. He didn't need Luther's voice to identify Sickle Mountain; a long curve, with a spur at right angles to one end, the name must have suggested itself to whoever saw it first. The observatory had been built where the handle of the sickle joined the blade; as the ship from which the view had been taken had approached, the details grew plainer. At the same time, it became evident that the plain inside the curve of the sickle was powdered with tiny sparkles, like tinsel dust on red-brown velvet.  "Great Ghu, are those all ships?"  "That's right. Look at this one, now."  The view changed. The aircraft was down, now, below the crest of the mountain, circling slowly above the plain. Hundreds, no, over a thousand, of them; two- and three-and five-hundred-footers, and here and there a thousand-footer that could have been converted into a hypership if anybody had wanted to take the trouble. The view changed again; this time from an aircar dropped from the ship, he supposed; it was down almost to the tops of the ships, and he could read names and home ports: _Pixie_, Chloris; _Helen O'Loy_, Anaitis. They were from Jurgen. _Sky-Rover_, Port Saunders; she was from Horvendile. Ships from Storisende, and Yellowmarsh on Janicot, and....  "Now we know where they all went."  It was logical, of course. Most of the hyperships used in the evacuation had been built here. It had been less trouble to lead the troops and the civilian workers from Poictesme and the other planets onto small normal-space ships and bring them here than to take the big ships away on short interplanetary runs to the other planets.  "Have you screened my father yet?"  "Yes. This is going to knock the bottom out of the companies that are building those ships at Storisende, I'm afraid."  "Their tough luck."  "It could be everybody's tough luck. Both those companies have been issuing stock, and there's been a lot of speculation in it. This market's so inflated now that a puncture at one place might blow the whole thing out."  He knew that. He shrugged. "Father will have to think of something. Tell him I'll screen him from Sickle Mountain."  Then he went back to his classroom.  "All right, class dismissed," he said. "You have twenty minutes to get your bags packed. We're going to work for real, now."  Airboats and airships flocked to Sickle Mountain; some of them hastened back to Port Carpenter for loads of food, for there was none in the storehouses at the embarkation camp. They inspected ship after ship, and chose two three-hundred-footers. They sent airships and freight-scows to the dozen-odd cities and industrial centers that had been already explored, to gather cargo, as far as possible the items in shortest supply on Poictesme.  "Don't worry about a market smash," his father told him. "We have that taken care of. Trisystem Investments has just bought up a lot of stock in both of those companies, and we've set up agreements with them--informally, of course; we'll have to get them voted on by our own companies--to sell them ships from Koshchei. In return, the company that's building the ship out of four air-freighters will go to Janicot, and the company that's building a ship out of the old Leitzenring Building will go to Jurgen, and they'll both stay off Koshchei. Sterber, Flynn & Chen-Wong will probably be defending antitrust suits till the end of time. The Planetary Government has stopped liking us, you know."  "Then we'll have to get one that will like us. There'll be an election about this time next year, won't there?"  His father nodded. "To use one of your expressions, we're working on it. How soon can you get your ships in?"  "Well be loaded and ready to lift off in a week. Another week for the trip."  "Well, don't forget that equipment you promised Kurt Fawzi."  "We'll have that on. Jerry Rivas is gathering it up now."  "How are you fixed for arms on Koshchei?"  "Arms? Why, there are some. There was a pretty big force of Space Marines on duty here, and they left everything they couldn't carry in their hands. Why? The Armageddonists and the Cybernarchists and Human Supremacy bought all you had on hand?"  "They're buying, but I wasn't thinking of that. I was thinking that your crews might need something to argue their way off the ships at Storisende with. Things are getting just slightly rugged here, now."   XVII  There were no bands or speeches when they came in this time. A lot of contragravity vehicles circled widely around the spaceport, but except for a few news-service cars, the police were keeping them back of a two-mile radius around the landing-pits. A couple of gunboats were making tight circles above, and on the dock were more vehicles and a horde of police and guards.  When Rodney Maxwell came across the bridge from the dock after they opened the airlocks, he was followed by a dozen Barton-Massarra private police, as villainous-looking a collection of ruffians as Conn had ever seen. He was wearing a new suit, with a waist-length jacket instead of the long coat he usually wore, and there was a holstered automatic on each hip. In Litchfield, he never carried more than one pistol, and Storisende was supposed to be an orderly place where nobody needed to go armed. More than anything else, that told Conn approximately what had been going on while he had been on Koshchei.  "Ship-guard," his father told Yves Jacquemont. "All your crew can come off; they'll take care of things. Get your people in that troop carrier over there. Everybody will stay at Interplanetary Building. None of the hotels are safe, not even the Ritz-Gartner. And be sure everybody's well armed when they come off the ship."  Jacquemont nodded. "I know the drill; I've been in Port Oberth on Venus and Skorvann on Loki. Any law we want, we make for ourselves."  "That's about it. I'll see you there. Conn, I wish you'd come with me. Somebody here wants to talk to you."  He wondered if his mother, or Flora, had come to Storisende. When he asked his father as they crossed onto the dock, there was a brief twinge of pain in Rodney Maxwell's face.  "No, they're not having anything to do--_Duck; quick!_"  Then his father was diving under a lifter-truck that stood empty on the dock. The private police were scattering for cover, and an auto-cannon began pom-pomming. Conn took one quick look in the direction in which it was firing, saw an aircar that had broken through the police line and was rushing toward them, and dived under the lifter after his father. As he did, he saw a missile flash out from one of the gunboats like a thrown knife. Then he huddled beside his father and put his arms over his head.  He felt the heat and shock of the explosion and, an instant later, heard the roar. When nothing immediately disastrous happened after he had counted fifteen seconds, he stuck his head out and looked up. The gunboat was struggling to regain her equilibrium, and the aircar had vanished in a fireball. They both emerged, straightening. His father was brushing himself with his hands and saying something about always having to duck under something when he had a new suit on.  "Robot control, probably; could have been launched from anywhere in town. Why, no; your mother and Flora aren't speaking to either of us, any more. Pity, of course, but I'm glad they're in Litchfield. It's a little healthier there."  They walked to the slim recon-car and climbed in, pulling the door shut after them. Wade Lucas was waiting for them at the controls.  "There, you see!" he began, as soon as he had the car lifting. "What I've been telling you. We'll have to stop this."  "Conn, meet our new partner. I told him everything you told me, out on the Mall, the day you came home. I had to," his father hastened to add. "He'd figured most of it out for himself. The only thing to do was admit him to the lodge and give him the oath."  "I didn't know about General Travis; I didn't even know he was still alive," Lucas said. "But the rest of it was pretty obvious, once I stopped jumping to conclusions and did a little thinking. You know, ever since I came here I've been preaching to these people to stop looking for Merlin and do something to help themselves. You're smarter than I am, Conn; instead of opposing them, you're guiding them."  "Did you tell Flora?"  Lucas shook his head. "I tried to explain what you're trying to do, but she wouldn't listen. She just told me I'd gotten to be as big a crook as you two." He had the car up to fifty thousand; putting it into a wide circle around the city, he locked the controls and got out his cigarettes. "Rod, we've got to stop this. You were just lucky this time. Some of these days your luck's going to run out."  "How can we stop?" Conn demanded. "Tell them the truth? They'd lynch us, and then go on hunting for Merlin."  "Worse than that; it'd be a smash worse than the one when the War ended. I was only ten then, but I can remember that very plainly. We can't stop it, and we wouldn't dare stop it if we could."  "What's been going on here in the last month?" Conn asked. "I've been too busy to keep in touch. I know there's been rioting, and these crackpot sects, but...."  "I think this is personal to us. There have been some ugly things happening. There were four attempts to burglarize our offices. I told you about some of the other stuff, the microphones we found, and so on. The worst thing was Lucy Nocero, my secretary. She just vanished, a couple of weeks ago. Three days later, the police found her wandering in a park, a complete imbecile. Somebody who either didn't know how to use one or didn't care what happened had used a mind-probe on her. It's twenty to one she'll never recover."  "It's this Storisende financial crowd," Wade Lucas said. "They had things all their own way till Alpha-Interplanetary was organized. Now they're getting shoved into the background, and they don't like it."  "They're making more money than they ever did, and they just love it," Rodney Maxwell said. "I'd think it was either Jake Vyckhoven or Sam Murchison."  "Murchison!" Lucas hooted. "Why, he's nobody! Federation Minister-General; all the authority of the Terran Federation, and nothing to enforce it with. He doesn't have a position, here; he has a disease. Sleeping sickness."  "He certainly doesn't believe there is a Merlin, does he?" Conn asked.  "I don't know what he believes, but he's getting to be Klem Zareff's opposite number. He thinks this whole thing's a plot against the Federation. It's a good thing Klem didn't get around to repainting his combat vehicles black and green, the way he did the Home Guard stuff at Litchfield."  "I'd be more likely to think it was Vyckhoven."  "Could be. Or it could be the Armageddonists, or Human Supremacy; I am ashamed to say that this heil-Merlin Cybernarchist gang are friendly to us. Or it could be some of the banking crowd, or some of these rival space-companies. Barton-Massarra is trying to find out. Well, we have some of Wade's pet suspects at Interplanetary Building now. There's been a meeting going for the last week to partition the Alpha Gartner System."  The Interplanetary Building had been a medium-class residence hotel at the time of the War. Junior staff officers and civilian technicians and their families had lived there. It had been vacant ever since the disastrous outbreak of peace. Now it had a big new fluorolite sign, and housed the offices of all the Maxwell companies. There was a truculent display of anti-vehicle weapons on the top landing stage, and more Barton-Massarra private police. They looked even more villainous then the ones at the spaceport. Conn recalled having heard that most of the Blackie Perales gang had been discharged for lack of evidence; he wondered how many of them had hired with Barton-Massarra.  The meeting was in a big conference room six floors down; it had been going on uninterrupted for days, with all the interested companies' representatives standing watch-and-watch around the clock. Lester Dawes and Morgan Gatworth and Lorenzo Menardes were there for L. E. & S.; Transcontinent & Overseas was represented; there were people from Alpha-Interplanetary, and bankers and financiers, and people from the companies building the two ships at the spaceport. And J. Fitzwilliam Sterber, the lawyer.  And reporters, phoning stories in and getting audiovisual interviews of anybody who would hold still long enough. They converged in a rush as Conn and his father and Lucas came in.  "No statement, gentlemen!" Rodney Maxwell shouted, above the babble of their questions. "When we have anything to release, it will be released to all of you."  Jacquemont and Nichols had already arrived; Lucas went to them and began talking about stevedores and lifters to get off the cargoes from the ships. Conn hastened to join them.  "The scanning and mining equipment aboard the _Helen O'Loy_," he said. "That shouldn't be unloaded here; we'll take the ship out to Force Command and unload it there."  Out of the corner of his eye, he saw, a lurking reporter snatch the handphone off his radio and begin talking; it would be stated authoritatively that Merlin was at Force Command and would be uncovered as soon as special equipment from Koshchei arrived.  Everybody at the long table was shouting at everybody else. The Jurgen and Janicot Companies wanted to buy ships from Koshchei Exploitation & Development. The Alpha-Interplanetary director, who was also a vice-president of Transcontinent & Overseas, opposed that; another director of A-I, who was also board chairman of Koshchei Exploitation & Development, wanted to sell ships to anybody who had the price, the Transcontinent & Overseas man was calling him a traitor to the company, and one of the stockbrokers, who was also a vice-president of Trisystem Investments and a director of Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines, was wanting to know which company. And a banker who was stockholder in all the companies was shouting that they were all a gang of crooks, and J. Fitzwilliam Sterber was declaring that anybody who called him a crook could continue the discussion through seconds.  Conn suddenly realized that dueling had never been illegal on Poictesme. He wondered how many duels this meeting was going to hatch.  The next afternoon the _Helen O'Loy_ was unloaded, all but the mining equipment; Conn and Yves Jacquemont and Charley Gatworth and a few others took her out to Force Command. They were met by Klem Zareff's armed airboats two hundred and fifty miles from the mesa, and they found the place in more of a state of siege than when the Badlands had been full of outlaws. A lot of heavy armament seemed to have been moved in from Barathrum Spaceport, and Zareff had more men and firepower than he had ever commanded during the System States War. If Minister-General Murchison was convinced that the Merlin excitement was a cover for some seditious plot against the Federation, this ought to give him food for thought.  There was still work, mostly boring lateral shafts for echo shots, going on at the butte, under the relay station. That was Leibert, who was still insisting that that was where Merlin was buried. There was also some work on top of the mesa, by those who were convinced that that was where Merlin was to be found. Kurt Fawzi was taking the lead in that. Franz Veltrin and Dolf Kellton sided with Leibert, and Fawzi's office clique had split into two factions. Judge Ledue was maintaining strict impartiality, as befitted his judicial position.  "Why hasn't your father gotten those detectives of his to work on this fake preacher?" Zareff wanted to know, when he and Tom Brangwyn were able to talk to Conn alone.  "Well, they've been busy," Conn said. "Trying to keep him alive, for one thing. You heard about the robo-bomb somebody launched at us the day we brought the ships in, didn't you?"  "Yes, and we heard about the Nocero girl, too," Brangwyn said. "But hasn't it ever occurred to you or your dad that this fellow that calls himself Leibert might be mixed up with the gang that did that?"  "You suspect him, too?"  Brangwyn nodded. "I took a few audiovisuals of him, when he didn't know it; I sent them to some different law-enforcement people over in Morven, where he says he comes from. They never saw him before, and couldn't find anybody who did."  "Well? He just doesn't have a police record, then."  "He says he's a preacher. Preachers don't go off in the woods by themselves to preach; they get up in pulpits, in front of a lot of people. Those towns over in Morven are small enough for everybody to have known something about him. He's a fake, I tell you."  "Let me have copies of those audiovisuals, Tom. I'll see what can be found out about him. I'm beginning to wonder about him myself. I'm sure I've seen him, somewhere...."  When he got back to Storisende, he found that the marathon conference on the sixth floor down at the Interplanetary Building had finally come to an end. Everybody seemed satisfied, and apparently nobody was going to have pistols and coffee with anybody else about it.  "We have things fixed up," his father told him. "The gang who are building the ship out of four air-freighters are chartered as Janicot Industries, Ltd.; they're going to specialize in chemical products. The other company has a charter now, too. They're going to operate on Jurgen and Horvendile. We'll sell them ships, and Alpha-Interplanetary will put on scheduled trips to all three planets and also Koshchei. We're getting along very nicely with them, except that everybody's competing for technicians and skilled labor. We have two hundred more people signed up for Koshchei. What you want to do is train as many of them as you can for ship-operation. Alpha-Interplanetary is going to start a training program here at Storisende; you'd better leave one of your ships for them to work on, and send back as many ships as you can find officers and crews for."  "We're getting things really started."  "Yes. The only trouble is...." His father frowned. "I don't understand these people, Conn. Everybody ought to be making millions out of this by this time next year, but all any of them, even these Storisende bankers, can talk about is how soon we're going to find Merlin."  "I wish we could stop that, somehow. Listen; I have it. Merlin never was on Poictesme; Merlin was a space-station a few thousand miles off-planet; there was a crew of operators aboard, and they communicated with Force Command by radio. When the War ended, they took it outside the system and shot off a planetbuster inside her. No more Merlin. How would that be?"  His father shook his head. "Wouldn't do. If anybody believed it, which I doubt, they'd just quit. The market would collapse, everybody would be broke, it would just be the end of the War all over again. Conn, we can't let it stop now. We're going too fast to stop; if we tried it, we'd smash up and break our necks."   XVIII  Jerry Rivas, Mack Vibart and Luther Chen-Wong had been keeping things running on Koshchei. Work on the interplanetary ship at Port Carpenter, had stopped when the Sickle Mountain ships had been found; it had never been resumed. When Conn returned, he found work started on the _Ouroboros II_. Some of the two hundred newcomers who came in on the _Helen O'Loy_ had special skills needed on the hypership; most of them went with Clyde Nichols and Charley Gatworth to Sickle Mountain to train as normal-space officers and crewmen. Some of them, it was hoped, would later qualify for hyperspace work. Sylvie, who had been one of the star pupils in the computer class, was now helping him with the long lists of needed materials, some of which had to be brought from other places as much as a thousand miles away. Jerry Rivas went back to exploring; Nichols had to drop his space-training work temporarily to organize a fleet of air-freighters; usually, the men best able to operate them were urgently needed on some job at the construction dock.  Ships lifted out almost daily from Sickle Mountain. They tried to get some kind of salable cargo for each one, without depriving themselves of what they needed for themselves. Some of the ships came back loaded with provisions and bringing new recruits--for instance, the teaching of physics and mathematics almost stopped at Storisende College because the professors had been virtually shanghaied.  Conn found himself losing touch with affairs on Poictesme. Ships had landed on both Janicot and Horvendile and were sending back claims to abandoned factories. By that time they had all the decks into the _Ouroboros II_, and he was working aboard, getting the astrogational and hyperspace instruments put in place. The hypership _Andromeda_ was back from the Gamma System; there was close secrecy about what the expedition had found, but the newscasts were full of conjectures about Merlin, and the market went into another dizzy upward spiral. Litchfield Exploration & Salvage opened a huge munitions depot, and combat equipment, once almost unsalable, was selling as fast as it came out. The Government was buying some, but by no means all of it.  "Conn, can you come back here to Poictesme for a while?" his father asked. "Things have turned serious. I don't like to talk about it by screen--too many people know our scrambler combinations. But I wish you were here."  He started to object; there were millions, well, a couple of hundred, things he had to attend to. The look on his father's face stopped him.  "Ship leaving Sickle Mountain tomorrow morning," he said. "I'll be aboard."  The voyage back to Poictesme was a needed rest. He felt refreshed when he got off at Storisende Spaceport and was met by his father and Wade Lucas in one of the slim recon-cars. They greeted him briefly and took the car up and away from the city, where it was safe to talk.  "Conn, I'm scared," his father said. "I'm beginning to think there really is a Merlin, after all."  "Oh, come off it! I know it's contagious, but I thought you'd been vaccinated."  "I'm beginning to think so, too," Lucas said. "I don't like it at all."  "You know what that gang who took the _Andromeda_ to Panurge found?"  "They were looking for the plant that fabricated the elements for Merlin, weren't they?"  "Yes. They found it. My Barton-Massarra operatives got to some of the crew. This place had been turning out material for a computer of absolutely unconventional design; the two computermen they had with them couldn't make head or tail of half of it. And every blueprint, every diagram, every scrap of writing or recording, had been destroyed. But they found one thing, a big empty fiber folder that had fallen under something and been overlooked. It was marked: TOP SECRET. PROJECT MERLIN."  "Project Merlin could have been anything," Conn started to say. No. Project Merlin was something they made computer parts for.  "Dolf Kellton's research crew, at the Library here, came across some references to Project Merlin, too. For instance, there was a routine division court-martial, a couple of second lieutenants, on a very trivial charge. Force Command ordered the court-martial stopped, and the two officers simply dropped out of the Third Force records, it was stated that they were engaged in work connected with Project Merlin. That's an example; there were half a dozen things like that."  "Tell him what Kurt Fawzi and his crew found," Wade Lucas said.  "Yes. They have a fifty-foot shaft down from the top of the mesa almost to the top of the underground headquarters. They found something on top of the headquarters; a disc-shaped mass, fifty feet thick and a hundred across, armored in collapsium. It's directly over what used to be Foxx Travis's office."  "That's not a tenth big enough for anything that could even resemble Merlin."  "Well, it's something. I was out there day before yesterday. They're down to the collapsium on top of this thing; I rode down the shaft in a jeep and looked at it. Look, Conn, we don't know what this Project Merlin was; all this lore about Merlin that's grown up since the War is pure supposition."  "But Foxx Travis told me, categorically, that there was no Merlin Project," Conn said. "The War's been over forty years; it's not a military secret any longer. Why would he lie to me?"  "Why did you lie to Kurt Fawzi and the others and tell them there was a Merlin? You lied because telling the truth would hurt them. Maybe Travis had the same reason for lying to you. Maybe Merlin's too dangerous for anybody to be allowed to find."  "Great Ghu, are you beginning to think Merlin is the Devil, or Frankenstein's Monster?"  "It might be something just as bad. Maybe worse. I don't think a man like Foxx Travis would lie if he didn't have some overriding moral obligation to."  "And we know who's been making most of the trouble for us, too," Lucas added.  "Yes," Rodney Maxwell said, "we do. And sometime I'm going to invite Klem Zareff to kick my pants-seat. Sam Murchison, the Terran Federation Minister-General."  "How'd you get that?"  "Barton-Massarra got some of it; they have an operative planted in Murchison's office. And some of our banking friends got the rest. This Human Supremacy League is being financed by somebody. Every so often, their treasurer makes a big deposit at one of the banks here, all Federation currency, big denomination notes. When I asked them to, they started keeping a record of the serial numbers and checking withdrawals. The money was paid out, at the First Planetary Bank, to Mr. Samuel S. Murchison, in person. The Armegeddonists are getting money, too, but they're too foxy to put theirs through the banks. I believe they're the ones who mind-probed Lucy Nocero. Barton-Massarra believe, but they can't prove, that Human Supremacy launched that robo-bomb at us, that time at the spaceport."  "Have you done anything with those audiovisuals of Leibert?"  "Gave them to Barton-Massarra. They haven't gotten anything, yet."  "So we have to admit that Klem wasn't crazy after all. What do you want me to do?"  "Go out to Force Command and take charge. We have to assume that there may be a Merlin, we have to assume that it may be dangerous, and we have to assume that Kurt Fawzi and his covey of Merlinolators are just before digging it up. Your job is to see that whatever it is doesn't get loose."  The trouble was, if he started giving orders around Force Command he'd stop being a brilliant young man and become a half-baked kid, and one word from him and the older and wiser heads would do just what they pleased. He wondered if the pro-Leibert and anti-Leibert factions were still squabbling; maybe if he went out of his way to antagonize one side, he'd make allies of the other. He took the precaution of screening in, first; Kurt Fawzi, with whom he talked, was almost incoherent with excitement. At least, he was reasonably sure that none of Klem Zareff's trigger-happy mercenaries would shoot him down coming in.  The well, fifty feet in diameter, went straight down from the top of the mesa; as the headquarters had been buried under loose rubble, they'd had to vitrify the sides going down. He let down into the hole in a jeep, and stood on the collapsium roof of whatever it was they had found. It wasn't the top of the headquarters itself; the microray scannings showed that. It was a drum-shaped superstructure, a sort of underground penthouse. And there they were stopped. You didn't cut collapsium with a cold chisel, or even an atomic torch. He began to see how he was going to be able to take charge here.  "You haven't found any passage leading into it?" he asked, when they were gathered in Fawzi's--formerly Foxx Travis's--office.  "Nifflheim, no! If we had, we'd be inside now." Tom Brangwyn swore. "And we've been all over the ceiling in here, and we can't find anything but vitrified rock and then the collapsium shielding."  "Sure. There are collapsium-cutters, at Port Carpenter, on Koshchei. They do it with cosmic rays."  "But collapsium will stop cosmic rays," Zareff objected.  "Stop them from penetrating, yes. A collapsium-cutter doesn't penetrate; it abrades. Throws out a rotary beam and works like a grinding-wheel, or a buzz-saw."  "Well, could you get one down that hole?" Judge Ledue asked.  He laughed. "No. The thing is rather too large. In the first place, there's a full-sized power-reactor, and a mass-energy converter. With them, you produce negamatter--atoms with negatively charged protons and positive electrons, positrons. Then, you have to bring them into contact with normal positive-matte--That's done in a chamber the size of a fifty-gallon barrel, made of collapsium and weighing about a hundred tons. Then you have to have a pseudograv field to impart rotary motion to your cosmic-ray beam, and the generator door that would lift ten ships the size of the _Lester Dawes_. Then you need another fifty to a hundred tons of collapsium to shield your cutting-head. The cutting-head alone weighs three tons. The rotary beam that does the cutting," he mentioned as an afterthought, "is about the size of a silver five-centisol piece."  Nobody said anything for a few seconds. Carl Leibert stated that Divine Power would aid them. Nobody paid much attention; Leibert's stock seemed to have gone bearish since he had found nothing in the butte and Fawzi had found that whatever-it-was on top of Force Command.  "Means we're going to dig the whole blasted top off, clear down to where that thing is," Zareff said. "That'll take a year."  "Oh, no. Maybe a couple of weeks, after we get started," Conn told them. "It'll take longer to get the stuff loaded on a ship and hauled here than it will to get that thing uncovered and opened."  He told them about the machines they used in the iron mines on Koshchei, and as he talked, he stopped worrying about how he was going to take charge here. He had just been unanimously elected Indispensable Man.  "Bless you, young man!" Carl Leibert cried. "At last, the Great Computer! Those who come after will reckon this the Year Zero of the Age of Regeneration. I will go to my chamber and return thanks in prayer."  "He's been doing a lot of praying lately," Tom Brangwyn remarked, after Leibert had gone out. "He's moved into the chaplain's quarters, back of the pandenominational chapel on the fourth level down. Always keeps his door locked, too."  "Well, if he wants privacy for his devotions, that's his business. Maybe we could all do with a little prayer," Veltrin said.  "Probably praying to Sam Murchison by radio," Klem Zareff retorted. "I'd like to see inside those rooms of his."  He called Yves Jacquemont at Port Carpenter after dinner. When he told Jacquemont what he wanted and why, the engineer remarked that it was a pity screens couldn't be fitted with olfactory sensors, so that he could smell Conn's breath.  "I am not drunk. I am not crazy. And I am not exercising my sense of humor. I don't know what Fawzi and his gang have here, but if it isn't Merlin it's something just as hot. We want at it, soonest, and we'll have to dig a couple of hundred feet of rock off it and open a collapsium can."  "How are we going to get that stuff on a ship?"  "Anything been done to that normal-space job we started since I saw it last? Can you find engines for it? And is there anything about those mining machines or the cutter that would be damaged by space-radiation or re-entry heat?"  Yves Jacquemont was silent for a good deal longer than the interplanetary time-lag warranted. Finally he nodded.  "I get it, Conn. We won't put the things in a ship; we'll build a ship around them. No; that stuff can all be hauled open to space. They use things like that at space stations and on asteroids and all sorts of places. We'll have to stop work on _Ouroboros_, though."  "Let _Ouroboros_ wait. We are going to dig up Merlin, and then everybody is going to be rich and happy, and live happily forever after."  Jacquemont looked at him, silent again for longer than the usual five and a half minutes.  "You almost said that with a straight face." After all, Jacquemont hadn't been cleared yet for the Awful Truth About Merlin, but, like his daughter, he'd been doing some guessing. "I wish I knew how much of this Merlin stuff you believe."  "So do I, Yves. Maybe after we get this thing open, I'll know."  To give himself a margin of safety, Jacquemont had estimated the arrival of the equipment at three weeks. A week later, he was on-screen to report that the skeleton ship--they had christened her _The Thing_, and when Conn saw screen views of her he understood why--was finished and the collapsium-cutter and two big mining machines were aboard. Evidently nobody on Koshchei had done a stroke of work on anything else.  "Sylvie's coming along with her; so are Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes and Ham Matsui and Gomez and Karanja and four or five others. They'll be ready to go to work as soon as she lands and unloads," Jacquemont added.  That was good; they were all his own people, unconnected with any of the Merlin-hunting factions at Force Command. In case trouble started, he could rely on them.  "Well, dig out some shootin'-irons for them," he advised. "They may need them here."  Depending, of course, on what they found when they opened that collapsium can on top of Force Command, and how the people there reacted to it.  _The Thing_ took a hundred and seventy hours to make the trip; conditions in the small shielded living quarters and control cabin were apparently worse than on the _Harriet Barne_ on her second trip to Koschchei. Everybody at Force Command was anxious and excited. Carl Leibert kept to his quarters most of the time, as though he had to pray the ship across space.  At the same time, reports of the near completion of _Ouroboros II_ were monopolizing the newscasts, to distract public attention from what was happening at Force Command. Cargo was being collected for her; instead of washing their feet in brandy, next year people would be drinking water. Lorenzo Menardes had emptied his warehouses of everything over a year old; so had most of the other distillers up and down the Gordon Valley. Melon and tobacco planters were talking about breaking new ground and increasing their cultivated acreage for the next year. Agricultural machinery was in demand and bringing high prices. So were stills, and tobacco-factory machinery. It began to look as though the Maxwell Plan was really getting started.  It was decided to send the hypership to Baldur on her first voyage; that was Wade Lucas's suggestion. He was going with her himself, to recruit scientific and technical graduates from his alma mater, the University of Paris-on-Baldur, and from the other schools there. Conn was enthusiastic about that, remembering the so-called engineers on Koshchei, running around with a monkey-wrench in one hand and a textbook in the other, trying to find out what they were supposed to do while they were doing it. Poictesme had been living for too long on the leavings of wartime production; too few people had bothered learning how to produce anything.  _The Thing_ finally settled onto the mesa-top. It looked like something from an old picture of the construction work on one of the Terran space-stations in the First Century. Immediately, every piece of contragravity equipment in the place converged on her; men dangled on safety lines hundreds of feet above the ground, cutting away beams and braces with torches. The two giant mining machines, one after the other, floated free on their own contragravity and settled into place. _The Thing_ lifted, still carrying the collapsium-cutting equipment, and came to rest on the brush-grown flat beyond, out of the way.  If Yves Jacquemont had overestimated the time required to get the equipment loaded and lifted off from Koshchei, Conn had been overoptimistic about the speed with which the top of the mesa could be stripped off. Digging away the rubble with which the pit had been filled, and even the solid rock around it, was easier than getting the stuff out of the way. Farm-scows came in from all over, as fast as they and pilots for them could be found; the rush to get brandy and tobacco to Storisende had caused an acute shortage of vehicles.  One by one, the members of the old Fawzi's Office gang came drifting in--Lorenzo Menardes, Morgan Gatworth, Lester Dawes. None of them had any skills to contribute, but they brought plenty of enthusiasm. Rodney Maxwell came whizzing out from Storisende now and then to watch the progress of the work. Of all the crowd, he and Conn watched the two steel giants strip away the tableland with apprehension instead of hope. No, there was a third. Carl Leibert had stopped secluding himself in his quarters; he still talked rapturously about the miracles Merlin would work, but now and then Conn saw him when he thought he was unobserved. His face was the face of a condemned man.  The _Ouroboros II_ was finished. The whole planet saw, by screen, the ship lift out; watched from the ship the dwindling away of Koshchei and saw Poictesme grow ahead of her. Twelve hours before she landed, work at Force Command stopped. Everybody was going to Storisende--Sylvie, whose father would command her on her voyage to Baldur, Morgan Gatworth, whose son would be first officer and astrogator, everybody. Except Carl Leibert.  "Then I'm not going either," Klem Zareff decided. "Somebody's got to stay here and keep an eye on that snake."  "No, nor me," Tom Brangwyn said. "And if he starts praying again, I'm going to go and pray along with him."  Conn stayed, too, and so did Jerry Rivas and Anse Dawes. They watched the newscast of the lift-out, a week later. It was peaceful and harmonious; everybody, regardless of their attitudes on Merlin, seemed agreed that this was the beginning of a new prosperity for the planet. There were speeches. The bands played "Genji Gartner's Body," and the "Spaceman's Hymn."  And, at the last, when the officers and crew were going aboard, Conn saw his sister Flora clinging to Wade Lucas's arm. She was one of the small party who went aboard for a final farewell. When she came off, along with Sylvie, she was wiping her eyes, and Sylvie was comforting her. Seeing that made Conn feel better even than watching the ship itself lift away from Storisende.   XIX  When Sylvie returned from Storisende, she had Flora with her. Conn's sister greeted him embarrassedly; Sylvie led both of them out of the crowd and over to the edge of the excavation.  "Go ahead, Flora," she urged. "Make up with Conn. It won't be any harder than making up with Wade was."  "How did that happen, by the way?" Conn asked.  "Your girlfriend," Flora said. "She came to the house and practically forced me into a car and flew me into Storisende, and then made me keep quiet and listen while Wade told me the truth."  "I wasn't completely sure what the truth was myself till Wade opened up," Sylvie admitted. "I had a pretty good idea, though."  "I always hated that Merlin thing," Flora burst out. "All those old men in Fawzi's office, dreaming about the wonderful things Merlin was going to do, with everything crumbling around them and everybody getting poorer every year, and doing nothing, nothing! And when you were coming home, I was expecting you to tell them there was no Merlin and to go to work and do something for themselves. But you didn't, and I couldn't see what you were trying to do. And then when Wade joined you and Father, I thought he was either helping you put over some kind of a swindle or else he'd started believing in Merlin himself. I should have seen what you were trying to do from the beginning. At least, from when you talked them into cleaning the town up and fixing the escalators and getting the fountains going again."  So the fountains weren't dusty any more.  "How's Mother taking things now?"  Flora looked distressed. "She goes around wringing her hands. Honestly. I never saw anybody doing that outside a soap opera. Half the time she thinks you and Father are a pair of unprincipled scoundrels, and the other half she thinks you're going to let Merlin destroy the world."  "I'm beginning to be afraid of something like that myself."  "Huh? But Merlin's just a big fake, isn't it? You're using it to make these people do something they wouldn't do for themselves, aren't you?"  "It started that way. What do you think all this is about?" he asked, gesturing toward the excavation and the two giant mining machines digging and blasting and pounding away at the rock.  "Well, to keep Kurt Fawzi and that crowd happy, I suppose. It seems like an awful waste of time, though."  "I'm afraid it isn't. I'm afraid Merlin, or something just as bad, is down there. That's why I'm here, instead of on Koshchei. I want to keep people like Fawzi from doing anything foolish with it when they find it."  "But there _can't_ be a Merlin!"  "I'm afraid there is. Not the sort of a Merlin Fawzi expects to find; that thing's too small for that. But there's something down there...."  The question of size bothered him. That drum-shaped superstructure couldn't even hold the personnel-record machine they had found here, or the computers at the Storisende Stock Exchange. It could have been an intelligence-evaluator, or an enemy-intentions predictor, but it seemed small even for that. It would be something _like_ a computer; that was as far as he was able to go. And it could be something completely outside the reach of his imagination.  At the back of his mind, the suspicion grew that Carl Leibert knew exactly what it was. And he became more and more convinced that he had seen the self-styled preacher before.  Finally, the whole top of the hundred-foot collapsium-covered structure was uncovered, and the excavation had been leveled out wide enough to accommodate all the massive paraphernalia of the collapsium-cutter. They put _The Thing_ onto contragravity again, and brought her down in place; the work of lifting off the reactor and the converter and the rest of it, piece by piece, began. Finally, everything was set up.  A dozen and a half of them were gathered in the room that had become their meeting-place, after dinner. They were all too tired to start the cutting that night, and at the same time excited and anxious. They talked in disconnected snatches, and then somebody put on one of the telecast screens. A music program was just ending; there was a brief silence, and then a commentator appeared, identifying his news-service. He spoke rapidly and breathlessly, his professional gravity cracking all over.  "The hypership _City of Asgard_, from Aton, has just come into telecast range," he began. "We have received an exclusive Interworld News Service story, recently brought to Aton on the Pan-Federation Spacelines ship _Magellanic_, from Terra.  "News of revived interest in the Third Force computer, Merlin, having reached Terra by way of Odin, representatives of Interworld News, to which this service subscribes, interviewed retired Force-General Foxx Travis, now living, at the advanced age of a hundred and fourteen, on Luna. General Travis, who commanded the Third Fleet-Army Force here during the War, categorically denied that there had ever existed any super-computer of the sort.  "We bring you, now, a recorded interview with General Travis, made on Luna...."  For an instant, Conn felt the room around him whirling dizzily, and then he caught hold of himself. Everybody else was shouting in sudden consternation, and then everybody was hushing everybody else and making twice as much noise. The screen flickered; the commentator vanished, and instead, seated in the deep-cushioned chair, was the thin and frail old man with whom Conn had talked two years before, and through an open segment of the dome-roof behind him the full Earth shone, the continents of the Western Hemisphere plainly distinguishable. A young woman in starchy nurse's white bent forward solicitously from beside the chair, handing him a small beaker from which he sipped some stimulant. He looked much as he had when Conn had talked to him. But there was something missing....  Oh, yes. The comparative youngster of seventy-some--"Mike Shanlee ... my _aide-de-camp_ on Poictesme ... now he thinks he's my keeper...." He wasn't in evidence, and he should be. Then Conn knew where and when he had seen the man who claimed to be a preacher named Carl Leibert.  "There is absolutely no truth in it, gentlemen," Travis was saying. "There never was any such computer. I only wish there had been; it would have shortened the War by years. We did, of course, use computers of all sorts, but they were all the conventional types used by business organizations...."  The rest was lost in a new outburst of shouting: General Travis, in the screen, continued in dumb-show. The only thing Conn could distinguish was Leibert's--Shanlee's--voice, screaming: "Can it be a lie? Is there no Great Computer?" Then Kurt Fawzi was pounding on the top of the desk and bellowing, "Shut up! Listen!"  "Frankly, I'm surprised," Travis was continuing. "Young Maxwell talked to me, here in this room, a couple of years ago; I told him then that nothing of the sort existed. If he's back on Poictesme telling people there is, he's lying to them and taking advantage of their credulity. There never was anything called Project Merlin...."  "Hah, who's a liar now?" Klem Zareff shouted. "Dolf, what did your people find in the Library?"  "Why, that's right!" Professor Kellton exclaimed. "My students did find a dozen references to Project Merlin. He couldn't be ignorant of anything like that."  "This youth has been lying to us all along!" the old man with the beard cried, pointing an accusing finger at Conn. "He has created false hopes; he has given us faith in a delusion. Why, he is the wickedest monster in human history!"  "Well, thank you, General Travis," another voice, from the screen-speaker, was saying. The only calm voice in the room. "That was a most excellent statement, sir. It should...."  "Conn, you didn't tell us you'd talked to General Travis," Morgan Gatworth was saying. "Why didn't you?"  "Because I never believed anything he told me. You were in Kurt Fawzi's office the day I came home; you know how shocked everybody was when I told you I hadn't been able to learn anything positive. Why should I repeat his lies and discourage everybody that much more? Why, he'd deny there was a Merlin if he was sitting on top of it," Conn declared. "He wants the credit for winning the War, not for letting Merlin win it for him."  "I don't blame Conn," Klem Zareff said. "If he'd told us that then, some of us might have believed it."  "And look what we found," Kurt Fawzi added, pointing at the ceiling. "Is that Merlin up there, or isn't it?"  "That little thing!" Shanlee cried scornfully. "How could that be Merlin? I am going to my chamber, to pray for forgiveness for this wretch."  He turned and started for the door.  "Stop him, Tom!" Conn said, and Tom Brangwyn put himself in front of the older man, gripping his right arm. Shanlee tried, briefly, to resist.  "Seems to me you lost faith in Merlin awfully quick," the former town marshal of Litchfield said. "You knew there was a Merlin all along, and you never wanted us to find it."  Franz Veltrin, who had been "Leibert's" most enthusiastic adherent, had also lost faith suddenly; he was shouting vituperation at the Prophet of Merlin.  "Knock it off, Franz; he was only doing his duty," Conn said. "Weren't you, General Shanlee?"  It took almost a minute before they stopped yelling for an explanation and allowed him to make one. He caught Klem Zareff's comment: "Must be pretty hot, if they have to send a general to handle it."  "I talked to Travis, yes. He gave me the same story he just repeated on that interview," Conn said, picking his way carefully between fact and fiction. "After I went back to Montevideo, he and this aide of his must have been afraid I didn't believe it, which I didn't. When I was ready to graduate, I got this offer of an instructorship; that was a bribe to keep me on Terra and off Poictesme. When I turned it down and took the _Mizar_ home, Travis sent Shanlee after me. He must have grown that beard and that pageboy bob on the way out. I suppose he contacted Murchison as soon as he landed. Wait a minute."  He went to the communication screen and punched out a combination. A girl appeared and singsonged: "Barton-Massarra, Investigation and Protection."  "Conn Maxwell here. We gave you some audiovisuals of a man with a white beard, alias Carl Leibert," he began.  "Just a sec, Mr. Maxwell." She spoke quickly into a handphone. The screen flickered, and she was replaced by a hard-faced young man in dark clothes.  "Hello, Mr. Maxwell; Joe Massarra. We haven't anything on Leibert yet."  "Are any of the officers of the _Andromeda_ where you can contact them? Let them see those audiovisual. I'll bet that beard was grown aboard ship coming out from Terra."  Bedlam broke out suddenly. Shanlee, who had been standing passively, his right arm loosely grasped by Tom Brangwyn, came down on Brangwyn's instep with the heel of his left foot and hit Brangwyn under the chin with the heel of his left palm. Wrenching his arm free, he started for the door. Sylvie Jacquemont snatched a chair and threw it along the floor; it hit the fleeing man's ankles and brought him down. Half a dozen men piled on top of him, and Brangwyn was yelling to them not to choke him to death till he could answer some questions.  "Hey, what's going on?" the detective-agency man in the screen was asking. "Need help? We'll start a car right away."  "Everything's under control, thank you."  Massarra hesitated for a moment. "What's the dope on this statement that was on telecast a few minutes ago?" he asked.  "Travis doesn't want us to find Merlin. What you just heard was one of his people, planted here at Force Command. We're going to question him when we have time. But there isn't a word of truth in that statement you just heard on the _Herald-Guardian_ newscast. Merlin exists, and we've found it. We'll have it opened inside of thirty hours at most."  That was the line he was going to take with everybody. As soon as he had Massarra off the screen, he was punching the combination of his father's private screen at Interplanetary Building. It took five interminable minutes before Rodney Maxwell came on. He could hear Klem Zareff shouting orders into one of the inside communication screens--general turnout, everything on combat-ready; guards to come at once to the office.  "How close are you to digging that thing out?" his father asked as soon as he appeared.  "We're down to it; we can start cutting the collapsium any time now."  "Start cutting it ten minutes ago," his father told him. "And don't leave Force Command till you have it open. How many men and vehicles does Klem have for defense? You'll need all of them in a couple of hours. Everybody here is stunned, now; they'll come out of it inside an hour, and they'll come out fighting."  "You'd better come out here." He turned, saw Jerry Rivas helping hold Shanlee in a chair, and shouted to him: "Jerry! Turn out the workmen. Start cutting the can open right away." He turned back to his father. "Klem's just ordered all his force out. Are you coming here?"  "I can't. In about an hour, everything's going up with a bang. I have to be here to grab a few of the pieces."  "You'll do a lot of good in jail, or on the end of a rope."  "Chance I have to take," his father replied. "I think I'll have a couple of hours. If anybody from the press calls you, what are you going to tell them?"  Conn repeated the line he had taken already. His father nodded.  "All right. I'll call you later. If I can. Just keep things going at your end."  A dozen of Klem Zareff's men were crowding into the room.  "This man's under close arrest," the old soldier was telling them. "He is very important and very dangerous. Take him out somewhere, search him to the skin, take his clothes away from him and give him a robe. He's to be watched every second; make sure he hasn't poison or other suicide means. He's to be questioned later."  As soon as Rodney Maxwell was off the screen, there was a call-signal. It was one of the news-services, wanting a statement.  "I'll take it," Gatworth said, and then began talking:  "This statement of General Travis's is completely false. There is a Merlin, and we've found it...."  They found something that might be good-enough Merlin for the next thirty hours. That superstructure was just big enough for the manually operated parts of a computer like Merlin; the input and output, and the programming machines.   XX  Klem Zareff's guardsmen were mercenaries. A little over a year ago they had, at best, been homeless drifters, and not a few had been outlaws. Now they were soldiers, well fed, clothed, quartered and equipped, and well and regularly paid. They had a good thing; they were willing to fight to keep it, Merlin or no Merlin. Conn left them to their commander. He did gather the workmen for a short harangue, but that wasn't really necessary. They had a good thing, too, and most of them realized that they were working toward a better thing. They could be depended upon, too.  They came crowding out and manned lifters; they got the heavy collapsium-cutter maneuvered into place and the shielding down around the cutting-head. After that, there were only four men who could work, each in his own heavily shielded cabin. In spite of the shielding that covered the actual work, there was an awesome display of multicolored light; it was like being in the middle of an aurora borealis. What was going on where that tiny rotating beam of cosmic rays was grinding at the collapsium simply couldn't have been imagined.  Conn would have liked to stay outside; he could not. Too many things were happening in too many places, and it was all coming in by screen. Rioting had broken out in Storisende and in a dozen other places. He saw, on a news-screen, a mob raging in front of the Executive Palace; yellow-shirted Cybernarchists were battling with city police and Planetary troops, Armageddonists and Human Supremacy Leaguers were fighting both and one another. Above all the confused noise of shouting and shooting, an amplifier was braying: "_It's a lie! It's a lie! Merlin has been found!_" Newsmen began arriving--Zareff's men had orders to pass them through the cordon that had been put up around Force Command--and they took up his time. It was worth it, though. They could tell him what was going on.  J. Fitzwilliam Sterber called. Rodney Maxwell had been arrested, on a farrago of fraud charges--"I don't know who he's supposed to have defrauded; the Planetary Government is the sole complainant"--and bail was being illegally denied. Sterber's lawyerly soul was outraged, but he was grimly elated. "You wait till things quiet down a little. We're going to start a false-arrest suit--"  "If you're alive to." Apparently Sterber hadn't thought of that. "What do you think's going to happen when the Stock Exchange opens?"  "It's going to be bad. But don't worry; your father must have foreseen something like this. He gave me instructions, and instructed a few more people." He named some of the Trisystem Investments people and some of the bankers. "We're going to try to brace the market as long as we can. Nobody who keeps his head is going to lose anything in the long run."  Luther Chen-Wong called from Port Carpenter, on Koshchei. He and Clyde Nichols and a young mathematics professor named Simon Macquarte had been running the colony, in Conn's absence and since Yves Jacquemont had gone to space in the _Ouroboros II_.  "Well, they caught up with you," he said. Evidently he had figured out what, the search for Merlin was all about, too. "What do we do about it?"  "Well, we are just before finding Merlin, here. I hope we find it before things get too bad." He told Luther the situation of the moment. "Have you people started on another hypership yet?"  "We're getting organized to. I don't suppose it's advisable to send any more ships in to Storisende for a while? And are you sure this thing you've found is Merlin?"  "I don't know what it is. It's only big enough for the apparatus they'd need to operate a thing like Merlin--Yes, Luther. I am sure we have found Merlin."  Chen-Wong looked at him curiously. "I hope so. I can't think of anything else that can stop this business."  Tom Brangwyn was in the room when he turned from the screen.  "We searched Leibert's--Shanlee's--rooms," he said. "We found a bomb."  "What kind of a bomb?"  "Vest-pocket thermonuclear. He seems to have gotten the fissionables by taking apart a couple of light tactical missiles; the whole thing's packed inside a hundred-pound power-cartridge case. It was in a traveling-bag under his bed. And you know how it was to be fired? With a regular 40-mm flare-pistol, welded into the end of the bomb. The flare-powder had been taken out of the cartridge, and it had been reloaded with a big charge of rifle-powder. I suppose it would blow one subcritical mass into another. But the only way he could have fired the bomb would have been by pulling the trigger."  And blowing himself up along with it. He must have wanted Merlin destroyed pretty badly.  "Have you questioned him yet?"  "Not yet. I wanted to tell you about it first."  He looked at his watch. Only four hours had passed since the newscast; why, that seemed like months, ago, now.  "All right, Tom; we'll go talk to him. Where's the Colonel?"  Zareff was surrounded by a dozen screens, keeping in touch with the _Lester Dawes_ and the gunboats and combat cars, and the gun positions with which he had ringed Force Command. It was only a little army, maybe, but he was a busy commander-in-chief.  "You take care of it. Tell me what you get from him. I can't leave now. There's a report of a number of aircraft approaching from the west now...."  They found Judge Ledue, and Kurt Fawzi and Dolf Kellton, who were just sitting around wishing there was something to do to help. They gave Franz Veltrin and Sylvie Jacquemont the job of keeping the representatives of the press amused. Then they went down to the room in which General Mike Shanlee was held under guard.  Shanlee, wearing a bathrobe and nothing else, was lying on a cot, sleeping peacefully; three of Zareff's men were sitting on chairs, watching him narrowly.  "All right; you can go," Conn told them. "We'll take care of him."  Shanlee woke instantly; he sat up and swung his legs over the edge of the cot.  "You have my name and rank," he said, and his voice no longer quavered. "My serial number is--" He recited a string of figures. "And that's all you're getting out of me."  "We'll get anything we want out of you," Conn told him. "You know what a mind-probe is? You should; your accomplices used one on my father's secretary. She's a hopeless imbecile now. You'll be, too, when we're through with you. But before then, you'll have given us everything you know."  Kellton began to protest. "Conn, you can't do a thing like that!"  "A mind-probe is utterly illegal; why, it's a capital offense!" Ledue exclaimed. "Conn I forbid you...."  "Judge, don't make me call those guards and have you removed," Conn said.  "You can stop bluffing," Shanlee told him. "Where would you get a mind-probe?"  "Out of the Chief of Intelligence's office, here in his headquarters. I should imagine it was to be used in interrogating Alliance prisoners, during the War. I think Colonel Zareff would enjoy helping to use it on you. He used to be an Alliance officer."  Shanlee was silent. Conn sat down in one of the chairs, at the small table.  "General Shanlee, would you describe General Foxx Travis as a man of honor and integrity? And would you so describe yourself?" Shanlee said nothing. "Yet both of you have lied, deliberately and repeatedly, to conceal the existence of Merlin. And we found that bomb in your room. You were willing to blow up this headquarters and everybody, yourself included, in it, to keep us from getting at Merlin. Well, you know that we can make you tell us the truth, maybe when it's too late, and you know that we are going to get Merlin. We're cutting the collapsium off that thing above now."  Shanlee laughed. "You're supposed to be a computerman. You think that little thing could be Merlin?"  "The controls and programming machine for Merlin." He turned to Kurt Fawzi. "You always claimed that Merlin was here in Force Command. You had it backward. Force Command is inside Merlin."  "What do you mean, Conn?"  "The walls; the fifty-foot walls, shielded inside and out. Merlin--the circuitry, the memory-bank, the relays, everything--was installed inside them. What's up above is only what was needed to operate the computer. Isn't that true, General?"  Shanlee had stopped his derisive laughter. He sat on the edge of the cot, tensing as though for a leap at Conn's throat.  "That won't help, either. If you try it, we won't shoot you. We'll just overpower you and start mind-probing right away. Now; you feel that suppressing Merlin was worth any sacrifice. We're not unreasonable. If you can convince us that Merlin ought not to be brought to light.... Well, you can't do any harm by talking, and you may do some good. You may even accomplish your mission."  "He can't talk us out of it," Kurt Fawzi seemed determined to spoil things by saying. "Conn, I'm coming around to Klem's way of thinking. They just don't want anybody else to have it."  "No, we don't," Shanlee said. "We don't want the whole Federation breaking up into bloody anarchy, and that's what'll happen if you dig that thing up and put it into operation."  Nobody said anything except Fawzi, who began an indignant contradiction and then subsided. Tom Brangwyn lit a cigarette.  "Would you mind letting me have one of those?" Shanlee said. "I haven't had a smoke since I came here. It wouldn't have been in character."  Brangwyn took one out of the pack, lit it at the tip of his own, and gave it to Shanlee with his left hand, his right ready to strike. Shanlee laughed in real amusement.  "Oh, Brother!" he reproved, in his former pious tones. "You distrust your fellow man; that is a sin."  He rose slowly, the bathrobe flapping at his bare shins, and sat down across the table from Conn.  "All right," he said. "I'll tell you about it. I'll tell you the truth, which will be something of a novelty all around."  Shanlee puffed for a moment at the cigarette; it must really have tasted good after his long abstinence.  "You know, we were really caught off balance when the War ended. It even caught Merlin short; information lag, of course. The whole Alliance caved in all at once. Well, we fed Merlin all the data available, and analyzed the situation. Then we did something we really weren't called upon to do, because that was policy-planning and wasn't our province, but we were going to move an occupation army into System States planets, and we didn't want to do anything that would embarrass the Federation Government later. We fed Merlin every scrap of available information on political and economic conditions everywhere in the Federation, and set up a long-term computation of the general effects of the War.  "The extrapolation was supposed to run five hundred years in the future. It didn't. It stopped, at a point a trifle over two hundred years from now, with a statement that no computation could be made further because at that point the Terran Federation would no longer exist."  The others, who had taken chairs facing him, looked at him blankly.  "No more Federation?" Judge Ledue asked incredulously. "Why, the Federation, the Federation...."  The Federation would last forever. Anybody knew that. There just couldn't be no more Federation.  "That's right," Shanlee said. "We had trouble believing it, too. Remember, we were Federation officers. The Federation was our religion. Just like patriotism used to be, back in the days of nationalism. We checked for error. We made detail analyses. We ran it all over again. It was no use.  "In two hundred years, there won't be any Terran Federation. The Government will collapse, slowly. The Space Navy will disintegrate. Planets and systems will lose touch with Terra and with one another. You know what it was like here, just before the War? It will be like that on every planet, even on Terra. Just a slow crumbling, till everything is gone; then every planet will start sliding back, in isolation, into barbarism."  "Merlin predicted that?" Kurt Fawzi asked, shocked.  If Merlin said so, it had to be true.  Shanlee nodded. "So we ran another computation; we added the data of publication of this prognosis. You know, Merlin can't predict what you or I would do under given circumstances, but Merlin can handle large-group behavior with absolute accuracy. If we made public Merlin's prognosis, the end would come, not in two centuries but in less than one, and it wouldn't be a slow, peaceful decay; it would be a bomb-type reaction. Rebellions. Overthrow of Federation authority, and then revolt and counterrevolt against planetary authority. Division along sectional or class lines on individual planets. Interplanetary wars; what we fought the Alliance to prevent. Left in ignorance of the future, people would go on trying to make do with what they had. But if they found out that the Federation was doomed, everybody would be trying to snatch what they could, and end by smashing everything. Left in ignorance, there might be a planet here and there that would keep enough of the old civilization to serve, in five or so centuries, as a nucleus for a new one. Informed in advance of the doom of the Federation, they would all go down together in the same bloody shambles, and there would be a Galactic night of barbarism for no one knows how many thousand years."  "We don't want anything like that to happen!" Tom Brangwyn said, in a frightened voice.  "Then pull everybody out of here and blow the place up, Merlin along with it," Shanlee said.  "No! We'll not do that!" Fawzi shouted. "I'll shoot the man dead who tries it!"  "Why didn't you people blow Merlin up?" Conn asked.  "We'd built it; we'd worked with it. It was part of us, and we were part of it. We couldn't. Besides, there was a chance that it might survive the Federation; when a new civilization arose, it would be useful. We just sealed it. There were fewer than a hundred of us who knew about it. We all took an oath of secrecy. We spent the rest of our lives trying to suppress any mention of Merlin or the Merlin Project. You have no idea how shocked both General Travis and I were when you told us that the story was still current here on Poictesme. And when we found that you'd been getting into the records of the Third Force, I took the next ship I could, a miserable little freighter, and when I landed and found out what was happening, I contacted Murchison and scared the life out of him with stories about a secessionist conspiracy. All this Armageddonist, Human Supremacy, Merlin-is-the-Devil, stuff that's been going on was started by Murchison. And he succeeded in scaring Vyckhoven with the Cybernarchists, too."  "This computation on the future of the Federation is still in the back-work file?" Conn asked.  Shanlee nodded. "We were criminally reckless; I can see that, now. Let me beg, again, that you destroy the whole thing."  "We'll have to talk it over among ourselves," Judge Ledue said. "The five of us, here, cannot presume to speak for everybody. We will, of course, have to keep you confined; I hope you will understand that we cannot accept your parole."  "Is there anything you want in the meantime?" Conn asked.  "I would like something to smoke, and some clothes," General Shanlee said. "And a shave and a haircut."   XXI  All through the night, a shifting blaze of many-colored light rose and dimmed the stars above the mesa. They stared in awe, marveling at the energy that was pouring out of the converters into a tiny spot that inched its way around the collapsium shielding. It must have been visible for hundreds of miles; it was, for there was a new flood of rumors circulating in Storisende and repeated and denied by the newscasts, now running continuously. Merlin had been found. Merlin had been blown up by Government troops. Merlin was being transported to Storisende to be installed as arbiter of the Government. Merlin the Monster was destroying the planet. Merlin the Devil was unchained.  Conn and Kurt Fawzi and Dolf Kellton and Judge Ledue and Tom Brangwyn clustered together, talking in whispers. They had told nobody, yet, of the interview with Shanlee.  "You think it would make all that trouble?" Kellton was asking anxiously, hoping that the others would convince him that it wouldn't.  "Maybe we had better destroy it," Judge Ledue faltered. "You see what it's done already; the whole planet's in anarchy. If we let this go on...."  "We can't decide anything like that, just the five of us," Brangwyn was insisting. "We'll have to get the others together and see what they think. We have no right to make any decision like this for them."  "They're no more able to make the decision than we are," Conn said.  "But we've got to; they have a right to know...."  "If you decide to destroy Merlin, you'll have to decide to kill me, first," Kurt Fawzi said, his voice deadly calm. "You won't do it while I'm alive."  "But, Kurt," Ledue expostulated. "You know why these people here at Storisende are rioting? It's because they've lost hope, because they're afraid and desperate. The Terran Federation is something everybody feels they have to have, for peace and order and welfare. If people thought it was breaking up, they'd be desperate, too. They'd do the same insane things these people here on this planet are doing. General Shanlee was right. Don't destroy the hope that keeps them sane."  "We don't need to do that," Kurt Fawzi argued. "We can use Merlin to solve our own problems; we don't need to tell the whole Federation what's going to happen in two hundred years."  "It would get out; it couldn't help getting out," Ledue said.  "Let's not try to decide it ourselves," Conn said. "Let's get Merlin into operation, and run a computation on it."  "You mean, ask Merlin to tell us whether it ought to be destroyed or not?" Ledue asked incredulously. "Let Merlin put itself on trial, and sentence itself to destruction?"  "Merlin is a computer; computers deal only in facts. Computers are machines; they have no sense of self-preservation. If Merlin ought to be destroyed, Merlin will tell us so."  "You willing to leave it up to Merlin, Kurt?" Tom Brangwyn asked.  Fawzi gulped. "Yes. If Merlin says we ought to, we'll have to do it."  Toward noon, a telecast went out from Koshchei, on a dozen different wave-lengths. Conn, half asleep in a chair in the commander-in-chief's office, saw Simon Macquarte, the young mathematics professor from Storisende College who had become one of the leaders of the colony, appear in the screen. The next moment, he was fully awake, shocked by Macquarte's words:  "This is not a threat; this is a solemn, even a prayerful, warning. We do not want to use genocidal weapons of mass destruction against the world of our birth. But whether we do or not rests solely with you.  "We came here with a dream of a better world, a world of happiness and plenty for all. We have been working, on Koshchei, to build such a world on Poictesme. Now you are smashing that dream. When it is gone, we will have nothing to live for--except revenge. And we will take that revenge, make no mistake.  "We have the weapons with which to take it. Remember, this was a Federation naval base and naval arsenal during the War. Here the Federation Navy built their super-missiles, the missiles which devastated Ashmodai, and Belphegor, and Baphomet, and hundreds of these weapons are here. We have them, ready for launching. Once they are launched, with the robo-pilots set for targets on Poictesme, you will have a hundred and sixty hours, at the most, to live.  "We will launch them immediately if there is another attack made upon Force Command Duplicate HQ, or upon Interplanetary Building in Storisende, or if Rodney Maxwell is killed, no matter by whom or under what circumstances.  "We beg you, earnestly and prayerfully, not to force us to do this dreadful thing. We speak to each one of you, for each one of you holds the fate of the planet in his own hands."  The image faded from the screen. As it did, Conn was looking from one to another of the people in the room with him. All were dumbfounded, most of them frightened.  "They wouldn't do it, would they?" Lorenzo Menardes was asking. "Conn, you know those people. They wouldn't really?"  "Don't depend on it, Lorenzo," Klem Zareff said. "It's hard for a lot of people to shoot somebody ten feet away with a pistol. But just sending off a missile; that's nothing but setting a lot of dials and then pushing a button."  "I'm not worrying about whether they'd do it or not," Conn said. "What I'm worrying about is how many people will believe they will."  Apparently a good many people did. Zareff's combat vehicles began reporting a cessation of fighting. The newscasts, repeating the ultimatum from Koshchei, told of fewer and fewer disorders in the city or elsewhere; by midafternoon, the rioting had stopped.  By that time, too, Rodney Maxwell was on-screen. He was, Conn noticed, wearing his pistols again.  "What happened?" he asked. "They let you out on bail?"  Maxwell shook his head. "Charges dismissed; they didn't have anything to charge me with in the first place. But they haven't let me out yet."  "You're wearing your guns."  "Yes, but they still have me penned up here at the Executive Palace; they're practically keeping me in the safe. I wish our people on Koshchei hadn't mentioned me in their ultimatum; Jake Vyckhoven's afraid to let me run around loose for fear some lunatic shoots me and starts the planetbusters coming in. Jake did one good thing, though. He ordered the Stock Exchange closed, and declared a five-day bank holiday. By that time, you ought to have Merlin opened and working, and then the market'll be safe."  Conn simply replied, "I hope so." There was no telling what kind of taps there might be on the screen his father was using; he couldn't risk telling him about Shanlee, or about the last computation which Merlin had made. "If we send the _Lester Dawes_ in, do you think you might talk them into letting you come out here?"  "I can try."  Flora arrived at Force Command that afternoon.  "I would have come sooner," she said, "but Mother's had a complete collapse. It happened last evening; she's in the hospital. I was with her until just an hour and a half ago. She's still unconscious."  "You mean she's in danger?"  "I don't know. They think she's all right, except for the shock. It was the Travis statement that did it."  "Think I ought to go to her?"  Flora shook her head. "Just keep on with what you're doing here. There isn't anything you can do for her now."  "The best thing you can do for her, Conn, is prove that you weren't lying about Merlin," Sylvie told him.  The _Lester Dawes_ didn't make it from Force Command to Storisende and back until after dark, and the green and white and red and orange lights were rising in folds and waves. Rodney Maxwell had heard about his wife's condition; it was the first thing he spoke of when Conn and Flora and Sylvie met him as he got off the ship.  "There isn't anything we can do, Father," Flora said. "They'll call us when there's any change."  He said the same thing Sylvie had said. "The only thing we can do is get that infernal thing uncovered. Once we do this, everything'll be all right. We'll show your mother that it isn't a fake and it isn't anything dangerous; we'll put a stop to all these horror-stories about mechanical devils and living machines...."  Conn drew his father off where the girls couldn't overhear.  "This is something worse," he said. "This is a bomb that could blow up the whole Federation."  "Are you going nuts, too?" his father demanded.  Conn told him about Shanlee; he repeated, almost word for word, the story Shanlee had told.  "Do you believe that?" his father asked.  "Don't you? You were in Storisende when the Travis statement came out; you saw how people acted. If this story gets out, people will be acting the same way on every planet in the Federation. Not just places like Poictesme; planets like Terra and Baldur and Marduk and Odin and Osiris. It would be the end of everything civilized, everywhere."  "Why didn't they use Merlin to save the Federation?"  "It's past saving. It's been past saving since before the War. The War was what gave it the final shove. If they could have used Merlin to reverse the process, they wouldn't have sealed it away."  "But you know, Conn, we can't destroy Merlin. If we did, the same people who went crazy over the Travis statement would go crazy all over again, worse than ever. We'd be destroying everything we planned for, and we'd be destroying ourselves. That bluff young Macquarte and Luther Chen-Wong and Bill Nichols made wouldn't work twice. And if they weren't bluffing...."  His father shuddered.  "And if we don't, how long do you think civilization will last here, if it blows up all over the rest of the Federation?"  The big machine cut on, a little spot of raw energy grinding away the collapsium, inch by inch; the undulating curtains of colored light illuminated the Badlands for miles around. Then, when the first hint of dawn came into the east, they went out. The steady roar of the generators that had battered every ear for over twenty-four hours stopped. There was unbelieving silence, and then shouts.  The workmen swarmed out to man lifters. Slowly the heavy apparatus--the reactor and the converters, the cutting machine, and the shielding around it--was lifted away. Finally, a lone lifter came in and men in radiation-suits went down to hook on grapples, and it lifted away, carrying with it a ten-foot-square sheet of thin steel that weighed almost thirty tons.  When they had battered a hole in the vitrified rock underneath, guards brought up General Shanlee. Somebody almost up to professional standards had given him a haircut; the beard was gone, too. A Federation Army officer's uniform had been found reasonably close to his size, and somebody had even provided him with the four stars of his retirement rank. He was, again, the man Conn had seen in the dome-house on Luna.  "Well, you got it open," he said, climbing down from the airjeep that had brought him. "Now, what are you going to do with it?"  "We can't make up our minds," Conn said. "We're going to let the computer tell us what to do with it."  Shanlee looked at him, startled. "You mean, you're going to have Merlin judge itself and decide its own fate?" he asked. "You'll get the same result we did."  They let a ladder down the hole and descended--Conn and his father, Kurt Fawzi, Jerry Rivas, then Shanlee and his two guards, then others--until a score of them were crowded in the room at the bottom, their flashlights illuminating the circular chamber, revealing ceiling-high metal cabinets, banks of button- and dial-studded control panels, big keyboards. It was Shanlee who found the lights and put them on.  "Powered from the central plant, down below," he said. "The main cables are disguised as the grounding-outlet. If this thing had been on when you put on the power, you'd have had an awful lot of power going nowhere, apparently."  Rodney Maxwell was disappointed. "I know this stuff looks awfully complex, but I'd have expected there to be more of it."  "Oh, I didn't get a chance to tell you about that. This is only the operating end," Conn said, and then asked Shanlee if there were inspection-screens. When Shanlee indicated them, he began putting them on. "This is the real computer."  They all gave the same view, with minor differences--long corridors, ten feet wide, between solid banks of steel cabinets on either side. Conn explained where they were, and added:  "Kurt and the rest of them were sitting here, all this time, wondering where Merlin was; it was all around them."  "Well, how did you get up here?" Fawzi asked. "We couldn't find anything from below."  "No, you couldn't." Shanlee was amused. "Watch this."  It was so simple that nobody had ever guessed it. Below, back of the Commander-in-chief's office, there was a closet, fifteen feet by twenty. They had found it empty except for some bits of discarded office-gear, and had used it as a catch-all for everything they wanted out of the way. Shanlee went to where four thick steel columns rose from floor to ceiling in a rectangle around a heavy-duty lifter, pressing a button on a control-box on one of them. The lifter, and the floor under it, rose, with a thick mass of vitrified rock underneath. The closet, full of the junk that had been thrown into it, followed.  "That's it," he said. "We just tore out the controls inside that and patched it up a little. There's a sheet of collapsium-plate under the floor. Your scanners simply couldn't detect anything from below."  Confident that Merlin would decree its own destruction, Shanlee gave his parole; the others accepted it. The newsmen were admitted to the circular operating room and encouraged to send out views and descriptions of everything. Then the lift controls were reinstalled, the lid was put back on top, and the only access to the room was through the office below. The entrance to this was always guarded by Zarel's soldiers or Brangwyn's police.  There were only a score of them who could be let in on the actual facts. For the most part, they were the same men who had been in Fawzi's office on the afternoon of Conn's return, a year and a half ago. A few others--Anse Dawes, Jerry Rivas, and five computermen Conn had trained on Koshchei--had to be trusted. Conn insisted on letting Sylvie Jacquemont in on the revised Awful Truth About Merlin. They spent a lot of their time together, in Travis's office, for the most part sunk in dejection.  They had finally found Merlin; now they most lose it. They were trying to reconcile themselves and take comfort from the achievement, empty as it was. They could see no way out. If Merlin said that Merlin had to be destroyed, that was it. Merlin was infallible. Conn hated the thought of destroying that machine with his whole being, not because it was an infallible oracle, but because it was the climactic masterpiece of the science he had spent years studying. To destroy it was an even worse sacrilege to him than it was to the Merlinolators. And Rodney Maxwell was thinking of the public effects. What the Travis statement had started would be nothing by comparison.  "You know, we can keep the destruction of Merlin a secret," Conn said. "It'll take some work down at the power plant, but we can overload all the circuits and burn everything out at once." He turned to Shanlee. "I don't know why you people didn't think of that."  Shanlee looked at him in surprise. "Why, now that you mention it, neither do I," he admitted. "We just didn't."  "Then," Conn continued, "we can tinker up something in the operating room that'll turn out what will look like computation results. As far as anybody outside ourselves will know, Merlin will still be solving everybody's problems. We'll do like any fortuneteller; tell the customer what he wants to believe and keep him happy."  More lies; lies without end. And now he'd have a machine to do his lying for him, a dummy computer that wouldn't compute anything. And all he'd wanted, to begin with, had been a ship to haul some brandy to where they could get a fair price for it.  Peace had returned. At first, it had been a frightened and uneasy peace. The bluff--he hoped that was what it had been--by the Koshchei colonists had shocked everybody into momentary inaction. In the twenty-four hours that had followed, the forces of sanity and order had gotten control again. Merlin existed and had been found. As for Travis's statement, the old general had been bound by a wartime oath of secrecy to deny Merlin's existence. The majority relaxed, ashamed of their hysterical reaction. As for the Cybernarchists and Armageddonists and Human Supremacy Leaguers, government and private police, vastly augmented by volunteers, speedily rounded up the leaders; their followers dispersed, realizing that Merlin was nothing but a lot of dials and buttons, and interestedly watching the broadcast views of it.  The banks were still closed, but discreet back-door withdrawals were permitted to keep business going; so was the Stock Exchange, but word was going around the brokerage offices that Trisystem Investments was in the market for a long list of securities. Nobody was willing to do anything that might upset the precarious balance; everybody was talking about the bright future, when Merlin would guide Poictesme to ever greater and more splendid prosperity.  Conn's father and sister flew to Litchfield; Flora stayed with her mother, and Rodney Maxwell returned to Force Command, shaking his head gravely.  "She's still unconscious, Conn," he said. "She just lies there, barely breathing. The doctors don't know.... I wish Wade hadn't gone on the ship."  The price of what he had wanted to do was becoming unendurably high for Conn.  They ran off the computations Merlin had made forty years before, and rechecked them. There had been no error. The Terran Federation, overextended, had been cracking for a century before the War; the strain of that conflict had started an irreversible breakup. Two centuries for the Federation as such; at most, another century of irregular trade and occasional war between independent planets, Galaxy full of human-populated planets as poor as Poictesme at its worst. Or, aware of the future, sudden outbursts of desperate violence, then anarchy and barbarism.  It took a long time to set up the new computation. Forty years of history for almost five hundred planets had to be abstracted and summarized and translated from verbal symbols to the electro-mathematical language of computers and fed in. Conn and Sylvie and General Shanlee and the three men and two women Conn had taught on Koshchei worked and rested briefly and worked again. Finally, it was finished.  "General; you're the oldest Merlin hand," Conn said, gesturing to the red button at the main control panel, "You do it."  "You do it, Conn. None of us would be here except for you."  "Thank you, General."  He pressed the button. They all stood silently watching the output slot.  Even a positronic computer does not work instantaneously. Nothing does. Conn took his eyes from the slot from which the tape would come, and watched the second-hand of the clock above it. The wait didn't seem like hours to him; it only seemed like seventy-five seconds, that way. Then the bell rang, and the tape began coming out.  It took another hour and a half of button-punching; the Braille-like symbols on the tape had to be retranslated, and even Merlin couldn't do that for itself. Merlin didn't think in human terms.  It was the same as before. In ignorance, the peoples of the Federation worlds would go on, striving to keep things running until they wore out, and then sinking into apathetic acceptance. Deprived of hope, they would turn to frantic violence and smash everything they most wanted to preserve. Conn pushed another button.  The second information-request went in: _What is the best course to be followed under these conditions by the people of Poictesme?_ It had taken some time to phrase that in symbols a computer would find comprehensible; the answer, at great length, emerged in two minutes eight seconds. Retranslating it took five hours.  In the beginning and for the first ten years, it was, almost item for item, the Maxwell Plan. Export trade, specialized in luxury goods. Brandies and wines, tobacco; a long list of other exportable commodities, and optimum markets. Reopening of industrial plants; establishment of new industries. Attainment of economic self-sufficiency. Cultural self-sufficiency; establishment of universities, institutes of technology, research laboratories. Then the Maxwell Plan became the Merlin Plan; the breakup of the Federation was a fact that entered into the computation. Build-up of military strength to resist aggression by other planetary governments. Defense of the Gartner Trisystem. Lists of possible aggressor planets. Revival of interstellar communications and trade; expeditions, conquest and re-education of natives....  "We can't begin to handle this without Merlin," Conn said. "If that means blowing up the Federation, let it blow. We'll start a new one here."  "No; if there's a general, violent collapse of the Federation, it'll spread to Poictesme," Shanlee told him. "Let's ask Merlin the big question."  Merlin took a good five minutes to work that one out. The question had to include a full description of Merlin, and a statement of the information which must be kept secret. The answer was even more lengthy, but it was summed up in the first word: _Falsification_.  "So Merlin's got to be a liar, too, along with the rest of us!" Sylvie cried. "Conn, you've corrupted his morals!"  The rest of it was false data which must be taped in, and lists of corrections which must be made in evaluating any computation into which such data might enter. There was also a statement that, after fifty years, suppression of the truth and circulation of falsely optimistic statements about the Federation would no longer have any importance.  "Well, that's it," Conn said. "Merlin thought himself out of a death sentence."  They crowded into the lift and went down to the office below. Everybody who knew what had been going on upstairs was there. Most of them were nursing drinks; almost everybody was smoking. All of them were silent, until Judge Ledue took his cigar from his mouth.  "Has the jury reached a verdict?" he asked, clinging with courtroom formality to his self-control.  "Yes, your Honor. We find the defendant, Merlin, not guilty as charged."  In the uproar his words released, Rodney Maxwell got to his feet and came quickly to Conn.  "Flora called just a while ago. Your mother is conscious; she's asking for us. Flora says she seems perfectly normal."  "We'll go right away; take a recon-car. General, will you explain things till I get back? Sylvie, do you want to come with us?"   XXII  It was autumn again, the second autumn since he had landed from the _City of Asgard_ at Storisende and taken the _Countess Dorothy_ home to Litchfield. Again the fields were bare and brown; all up and down the Gordon Valley the melons were harvested, and the wine-pressing was ready to start.  The house was crowded today. All top-level Litchfield seemed to have turned out, and there were guests from Storisende, and even a few who had made the trip from Koshchei to be there, Simon Macquarte, the president of Koshchei Tech; Conn would always remember him in the screen threatening a whole planet with devastation. Luther Chen-Wong, the chief executive of Koshchei Colony. Clyde Nichols, the president of Koshchei Airlines.  He almost bumped into Yves Jacquemont, coming in from the hall. Jacquemont's beard had been trimmed down to a small imperial, and he was wearing the uniform of Trisystem & Interstellar Spacelines, nothing at all like a Federation Space Navy uniform. He was laughing about something; he threw an arm over Conn's shoulder, and they went into the front parlor together.  "Oh, Gehenna of a big crop!" he heard Klem Zareff's voice, chuckling happily, above the babble in the room. "You wouldn't believe it. Why, we had to build six new vats...."  The thin-faced, white-haired man in the chair beside him said something. Mike Shanlee and Klem Zareff, old enemies, were not fast friends. Shanlee had come in from Force Command with Conn that morning. He had stayed on Poictesme as nominal head of Project Merlin, and intended to remain there for the rest of his life.  "Oh, there aren't any more farm-tramps," Zareff replied. "Everybody's getting factory jobs off-planet. I have an awful time getting help, and what I can get won't work for less than ten sols a day. Why, they're even organizing a union...."  There were feminine shrieks from across the room, and a stampede. The housecleaning-robot had come in, running its vacuum-cleaning hose around and brandishing its mops. He saw his mother break away from a group of older ladies and shout:  "_Oscar!_"  The robot stopped dead. "Yash'm?" a voice came out of it, Sheshan-accented.  "Go out!" his mother commanded. "Go to kitchen. Stay there."  "Yash'm." The robot floated out the door to the hall.  His mother rejoined her friends. Probably telling them, for the thousandth time, that her boy Conn fixed up the sound receptors and voice for Oscar. Or harping on how Conn had been telling everybody the truth, all along, and people wouldn't believe him.  Sylvie came up to him and caught his arm. "Come on, Conn; they're going to start the rehearsal," she said.  "They've been going to start it for an hour," her father told her.  "Well, they're really going to start it now."  "All right. You two run along," Yves Jacquemont said. "And you'd better start rehearsing for your own wedding before long. The _Genji_ will be ready to hyper out in another month, and I don't want to be at space when my only daughter gets married."  They pushed through the crowd, dragging Conn's mother with them toward the big living room beyond. On the way, Mrs. Maxwell stopped to try to drag Judge Ledue out of a chair.  "Judge, the rehearsal is starting; they can't do it without you."  Ledue clung to his chair. "They daren't do it with me, Mrs. Maxwell. If I get into it, it won't be a rehearsal; they'll be really married, and then there won't be any point in having a wedding tomorrow."  "Oh, Morgan!" Conn called across the room to Gatworth. "You've just been appointed temporary judge for the wedding rehearsal!"  There was a big crowd around Wade Lucas, in the next room; he was telling them about the voyage to Baldur, from which he had returned, and the one to Irminsul, with a cargo of arms, machine tools and contragravity vehicles, on which he and his bride would go for their honeymoon. There was another crowd around Flora; she was telling them about the new fashions on Baldur, which had been brought back on the _Ouroboros II_.  "Where's your father?" his mother was asking him. "He has to rehearse giving the bride away."  "Probably in his office. I'll go get him."  "You'll get into an argument with somebody and forget to come back," his mother said. "Sylvie, you go with him, and bring both of them back."  "When'll we have our wedding, Sylvie?" he asked as they went off together.  "Well, before Dad goes to Aditya with the _Genji_. That'll have to be in a month."  "Two weeks? That ought to be plenty of time to get ready, and let people recover from this one."  "Everybody's here now. Let's make it a double wedding tomorrow," she suggested.  He hadn't been prepared for that. "Well, I hadn't expected.... Sure! Good idea!" he agreed.  There was a crowd in Rodney Maxwell's little office--Fawzi and some others, and some Storisende people. One of the latter was vociferating:  "Jake Vyckhoven's no good, and he never was any good!"  "Well, you have to admit, if he hadn't ordered the banks and the Stock Exchange closed that time, we'd have had a horrible panic--"  "Admit nothing of the kind! Jethro, you were there, you'll bear me out. About a dozen of us were at Executive Palace for hours, bullying him into that. Why, we almost had to twist one of his arms while he was signing the order with the other. And now he has the gall to run for re-election on the strength of his heroic actions at the time of the Travis Hoax!"  "I know who we want for President!" another Storisende man exclaimed. "He's right here in this room!"  "Yes!" Rodney Maxwell almost bellowed, before the other man could say anything else. "Here he is!" He grabbed Kurt Fawzi by the arm and yanked him to his feet. "Here's the man most responsible for finding Merlin; the man who first suggested sending my son Conn to Terra to school, the man who, more than anyone else, devoted his life to the search for Merlin, the man whose inextinguishable faith and indomitable courage kept that search alive through its darkest hours. Everybody, get a drink; a toast to our next President, Kurt Fawzi!"  Conn was sure he heard his father add: "Ghu, what a narrow escape!"  Then he and Sylvie began chanting, in unison, "_We want Fawzi! We want Fawzi!_"LIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS  "Standing on the steps ... was a creature shaped like a man, but more savage than a gorilla"  "We were in the heart of the _Crystal Mountains!_"  "'Who and what are you, and whence do you come?'"  "It curled itself over the edge of the hovering air ship and drew it down"     CHAPTER I   A MARVELOUS INVENTION  I am a hero worshiper; an insatiable devourer of biographies; and I say that no man in all the splendid list ever equaled Edmund Stonewall. You smile because you have never heard his name, for, until now, his biography has not been written. And this is not truly a biography; it is only the story of the crowning event in Stonewall's career.  Really it humbles one's pride of race to see how ignorant the world is of its true heroes. Many a man who cuts a great figure in history is, after all, a poor specimen of humanity, slavishly following old ruts, destitute of any real originality, and remarkable only for some exaggeration of the commonplace. But in the case of Edmund Stonewall the world cannot be blamed for its ignorance, because, as I have already said, his story remains to be written, and hitherto it has been guarded as a profound secret.  I do not wish to exaggerate; yet I cannot avoid seeming to do so in simply telling the facts. If Stonewall's proceedings had become Matter  of common knowledge the world would have been--I must speak plainly--revolutionized. He held in his hands the means of realizing the wildest dreams of power, wealth, and human mastery over the forces of nature, that any enthusiast ever treasured in his prophetic soul. It was a part of his originality that he never entertained the thought of employing his advantage in any such way. His character was entirely free from the ordinary forms of avidity. He cared nothing for wealth in itself, and as little for fame. All his energies were concentrated upon the attainment of ends which nobody but himself would have regarded as of any practical importance. Thus it happened that, having made an invention which would have put every human industry upon a new footing, and multiplied beyond the limits of calculation the activities and achievements of mankind, this extraordinary person turned his back upon the colossal fortune which he had but to stretch forth his hand and grasp, refused to seize the unlimited power which his genius had laid at his feet, and used his unparalleled discovery for a purpose so eccentric, so wildly unpractical, so utterly beyond the pale of waking life, that to any ordinary man he must have seemed a lunatic lost in an endless dream of bedlam. And to this day I cannot, without a nervous thrill, think how the desire of all the ages, the ideal that has been the loadstar for thousands of philosophers, savants, inventors, prophets, and dreamers, was actually realized upon the earth; and yet of all its fifteen hundred million inhabitants but a single one knew it, possessed it, controlled it--and he would not reveal it, but hoarded and used his knowledge for the accomplishment of the craziest design that ever took shape in a human brain.  Now, to be more specific. Of Stonewall's antecedents I know very little. I only know that, in a moderate way, he was wealthy, and that he had no immediate family ties. He was somewhere near thirty years of age, and held the diploma of one of our oldest universities. But he was not, in a general way, sociable, and I never knew him to attend any of the reunions of his former classmates, or to show the slightest interest in any of the events or functions of society, although its doors were open to him through some distant relatives who were widely connected in New York, and who at times tried to draw him into their circle. He would certainly have adorned it, but it had no attraction for him. Nevertheless he was a member of the Olympus Club, where he frequently spent his evenings. But he made very few acquaintances even there, and I believe that except myself, Jack Ashton, Henry Darton, and Will Church, he had no intimates. And we knew him only at the club. There, when he was alone with us, he sometimes partly opened up his mind, and we were charmed by his variety of knowledge and the singularity of his conversation. I shall not disguise the fact that we thought him extremely eccentric, although the idea of anything in the nature of insanity never entered our heads. We knew that he was engaged in recondite researches of a scientific nature, and that he possessed a private laboratory, although none of us had ever entered it. Occasionally he would speak of some new advance of science, throwing a flood of light by his clear expositions upon things of which we should otherwise have remained profoundly ignorant. His imagination flashed like lightning over the subject of his talk, revealing it at the most unexpected angles, and often he roused us to real enthusiasm for things the very names of which we almost forgot amidst the next day's occupations.  There was one subject on which he was particularly eloquent--radioactivity; that most strange property of matter whose discovery had been the crowning glory of science in the closing decade of the nineteenth century. None of us really knew anything about it except what Stonewall taught us. If some new incomprehensible announcement appeared in the newspapers we skipped it, being sure that Edmund would make it all clear at the club in the evening. He made us understand, in a dim way, that some vast, tremendous secret lay behind it all. I recall his saying, on one occasion, not long before the blow fell:  "Listen to this! Here's Professor Thomson declaring that a single grain of radium contains in its padlocked atoms energy enough to lift a million tons three hundred yards high. Professor Thomson is too modest in his estimates, and he hasn't the ghost of an idea how to get at that energy. Neither has Professor Rutherford, nor Lord Kelvin; _but somebody will get at it, just the same_."  He positively thrilled us when he spoke thus, for there was a look in his eyes which seemed to penetrate depths unfathomable to our intelligence. Yet we had not the faintest conception of what was really passing in his mind. If we had understood it, if we had caught a single clear glimpse of the workings of his intellect, we should have been appalled. And if we had known how close we stood to the verge of an abyss of mystery about to be lighted by such a gleam as had never before been emitted from the human spirit, I believe that we would have started from our chairs and fled in dismay.  But we understood nothing, except that Edmund was indulging in one of his eccentric dreams, and Jack, in his large, careless, good-natured way broke in with:  "Well, Edmund, suppose _you_ could 'get at it,' as you say; what would you do with it?"  Stonewall's eyes gleamed for a moment, and then he replied, with a curious emphasis:  "I might do what Archimedes dreamed of."  None of us happened to remember what it was that Archimedes had dreamed, and the subject was dropped.  For a considerable time afterwards we saw nothing of Stonewall. He did not come to the club, and we were beginning to think of looking him up, when one evening, quite unexpectedly, he dropped in, wearing an unusually cheerful expression. We had greatly missed him, and we now greeted him with effusion. His animation impressed us all, and he had no sooner shaken hands than he said, with suppressed excitement in his voice:  "Well, I've 'got at it.'"  "Got at what?" drawled Jack.  "The inter-atomic energy. I've got it under control."  "The deuce you have!" said Jack.  "Yes, I've arrived where a certain professor dreamed of being when he averred that 'when man knows that every breath of air he draws has contained within itself force enough to drive the workshops of the world he will find out some day, somehow, some way of tapping that energy.' The thing is done, for I've tapped it!"  We stared at one another, not knowing what to say, except Jack, who, inspired by the spirit of mischief, drawled out:  "Ah, yes, I remember. Well then, Edmund, as I asked you before, what are you going to do with it?"  There was not really any thought among us of poking fun at Edmund; we respected and admired him far too much for that; nevertheless, catching the infection of banter from Jack, we united in demanding, in a manner which I can now see must have appeared most provoking:  "Why, yes, Edmund, tell us what you are going to do with it."  And then Jack added fuel by mockingly, though with perfectly good-natured intention, taking Edmund by the hand and swinging him in front of us with:  "Gentlemen, Archimedes junior."  Stonewall's eyes flashed and his cheek darkened, but for a moment he said nothing. Presently, with a return of his former affability, he said:  "I wish you would come over to the laboratory and let me show you what I am going to do."  Of course we instantly assented. Nothing could have pleased us better than this invitation, for we had long been dying to see the inside of Edmund's laboratory. We all got our hats and started out with him. We knew where he lived, occupying a whole house though he was a bachelor, but none of us had ever seen the inside of it, and our curiosity was on the _qui vive_. He led us through a handsome hallway and a rear apartment directly into the back yard, half of which we were surprised to find inclosed and roofed over, forming a huge shanty, like a workshop. Edmund opened the door of the shanty and ushered us in.  A remarkable object at once concentrated our attention. In the center of the place was the queerest-looking thing that you can well imagine. I can hardly describe it. It was round and elongated like a boiler, with bulging ends, and seemed to be made of polished steel. Its total length was about eighteen feet, and its width ten feet. Edmund approached it and opened a door in the end, which was wide and high enough for us to enter without stooping or crowding.  "Step in, gentlemen," he said, and unhesitatingly we obeyed him, all except Church, who for some unknown reason remained outside, and when we looked for him had disappeared.  Edmund turned on a bright light, and we found ourselves in an oblong chamber, beautifully fitted up with polished woodwork, and leather-cushioned seats running round the sides. Many metallic knobs and handles shone on the walls.  "Sit down," said Edmund, "and I will tell you what I have got here."  He stepped to the door and called again for Church but there was no answer. We concluded that, thinking the thing would be too deep to be interesting, he had gone back to the club. That was not what he had done, as you will learn later, but he never regretted what he did do. Getting no response from Church, Edmund finally sat down with us on one of the leather-covered benches, and began his explanation.  "As I was telling you at the club," he said, "I've solved the mystery of the atoms. I'm sure you'll excuse me from explaining my method" (there was a little raillery in his manner), "but at least you can understand the plain statement that I've got unlimited power at my command. These knobs and handles that you see are my keys for turning it on and off, and controlling it as I wish. Mark you, this power comes right out of the heart of what we call matter; the world is chock full of it. We have known that it was there at least ever since radioactivity was discovered, but it looked as though human intelligence would never be able to set it free from its prison. Nevertheless I have not only set it free, but I am able to control it as perfectly as if it were steam from a boiler, or an electric current from a dynamo."  Jack, who was as unscientific a person as ever lived, yawned, and Edmund noticed it. But he showed no irritation, merely smiling, and saying, with a wink at me and Henry:  "Even this seems to be rather too deep, so perhaps I had better show you, instead of telling you, what I mean. Excuse me a moment."  He stepped out of the door, and we remained seated. We heard a noise outside like the opening of a barn door, and immediately Edmund reappeared and closed the door of the chamber in which we were. We watched him with growing curiosity. With a singular smile he pressed a knob on the wall, and instantly we felt that the chamber was rising in the air. It rocked a little like a boat in wavy water. We were startled, of course, but not alarmed.  "Hello!" exclaimed Jack. "What kind of a balloon is this?"  "It's something more than a balloon," was Edmund's reply, and as he spoke he touched another knob, and we felt the car, as I must now call it, come to rest. Then Edmund opened a shutter at one side, and we all sprang up to look out. Below us we saw roofs and the tops of two trees standing at the side of the street.  "We're about a hundred feet up," said Edmund quietly. "What do you think of it now?"  "Wonderful! wonderful!" we exclaimed in a breath. And I continued:  "And do you say that it is inter-atomic energy that does this?"  "Nothing else in the world," returned Edmund.  But bantering Jack must have his quip:  "By the way, Edmund," he demanded, "what was it that Archimedes dreamed? But no matter; you've knocked him silly. Now, what are you going to do with your atomic balloon?"  Edmund's eyes flashed:  "You'll see in a minute."  The scene out of the window was beautiful, and for a moment we all remained watching it. The city lights were nearly all below our level, and away off over the New Jersey horizon I noticed the planet Venus, near to setting, but as brilliant as a diamond. I am fond of star-gazing, and I called Edmund's attention to the planet as he happened to be standing next to me.  "Lovely, isn't she?" he said with enthusiasm. "The finest world in the solar system, and what a strange thing that she should have one side always day and the other always night."  I was surprised by his exhibition of astronomic lore, for I had never known that he had given any attention to the subject, but a minute later the incident was forgotten as Edmund suddenly pushed us back from the window and closed the shutter.  "Going down again so soon?" asked Jack.  Edmund smiled. "Going," he said simply, and put his hand to one of the knobs. Immediately we felt ourselves moving very slowly.  "That's right, Edmund," put in Jack again, "let us down easy; I don't like bumps."  We expected at each instant to feel the car touch the cradle in which it had evidently rested, but never were three mortals so mistaken. What really did happen can better be described in the words of Will Church, who, you will remember, had disappeared at the beginning of our singular adventure. I got the account from him long afterwards. He had written it out carefully and put it away in a safe, as a sort of historic document. Here is Church's narrative, omitting the introduction, which read like a law paper:  "When we went over from the club to Stonewall's house, I dropped behind the others, because the four of them took up the whole width of the sidewalk. Stonewall was talking to them, and my attention was attracted by something uncommon in his manner. He had an indefinable carriage of the head which suggested to me the suspicion that everything was not just as it should be. I don't mean that I thought him crazy, or anything of that kind, but I felt that he had some scheme in his mind to fool us.  "I bitterly repented, after things turned out as they did, that I had not whispered a word to the others. But that would have been difficult, and, besides, I had no idea of the seriousness of the affair. Nevertheless, I determined to stay out of it, so that the laugh should not be on me at any rate. Accordingly when the others entered the car I stayed outside, and when Stonewall called me I did not answer.  "When he came out to open the roof of the shed, he did not see me in the shadow where I stood. The opening of the roof revealed the whole scheme in a flash. I had had no suspicion that the car was any kind of a balloon, and even after he had so significantly thrown the roof open, and then entered the car and closed the door, I was fairly amazed to see the thing began to rise without the slightest noise, and as if it were enchanted. It really looked diabolical as it floated silently upward and passed through the opening, and the sight gave me a shiver.  "But I was greatly relieved when it stopped at a height of a hundred feet or so, and then I said to myself that I should have been less of a fool if I had stayed with the others, for now they would have the laugh on me alone. Suddenly, while I watched, expecting every moment to see them drop down again, for I supposed that it was merely an experiment to show that the thing would float, the car started upward, very slowly at first, but increasing its speed until it had attained an elevation of perhaps five hundred feet. There it hung for a moment, like some mail-clad monster glinting in the quavering light of the street arcs, and then, without warning, made a dart skyward. For a minute it circled like a strange bird taking its bearings, and finally rushed off westward until I lost sight of it behind some tall buildings. I ran into the house to reach the street, but found the outer door locked, and not a person visible. I called but nobody came. Returning to the yard I discovered a place where I could get over the fence, and so I escaped into the street. Immediately I searched the sky for the mysterious car, but could see no sign of it. They were gone! I almost sank upon the pavement in a state of helpless excitement, which I could not have explained to myself if I had stopped to reason; for why, after all, should I take the thing so tragically. But something within me said that all was wrong. A policeman happened to pass.  "'Officer! officer!' I shouted, 'have you seen it?'  "'Seen what?' asked the blue-coat, twirling his club.  "'The car--the balloon,' I stammered.  "'Balloon in your head! You're drunk. Get long out o' here!'  "I realized the impossibility of explaining the matter to him, and running back to the place where I had got over the fence I climbed into the yard and entered the shed. Fortunately the policeman paid no further attention to my movements after I left him. I sat down on the empty cradle and stared up through the opening in the roof, hoping against hope to see them coming back. It must have been midnight before I gave up my vigil in despair, and went home, sorely puzzled, and blaming myself for having kept my suspicions unuttered. I finally got to sleep, but I had horrible dreams.  "The next day I was up early looking through all the papers in the hope of finding something about the car. But there was not a word. I watched the news columns for several days without result. Whenever the coast was clear I haunted Stonewall's yard, but the fatal shed yawned empty, and there was not a soul about the house. I cannot describe my feelings. My friends seemed to have been snatched away by some mysterious agency, and the horror of the thing almost drove me crazy. I felt that I was, in a manner, responsible for their disappearance.  "One day my heart sank at the sight of a cousin of Jack Ashton's motioning to me in the street. He approached, with a troubled look. 'Mr. Church,' he said, 'I think you know me; can you tell me what has become of Jack? I haven't seen him for several days.' What could I say? Still believing that they would soon come back, I invented, on the spur of the moment, a story that Jack, with a couple of intimate friends, had gone off on a hunting expedition. I took a little comfort in the reflection that my friends, like myself, were bachelors, and consequently at liberty to disappear if they chose.  "But when more than a week had passed with out any news of them I was thrown into despair. I had to give up all hope. Remembering how near we were to the coast, I concluded that they had drifted out over the sea and gone down. It was hard for me, after the lie I had told, to let out the truth to such of their friends as I knew, but I had to do it. Then the police took the matter in hand and ransacked Stonewall's laboratory and the shanty without finding anything to throw light on the mystery. It was a newspaper sensation for a few days, but as nothing came of it everybody soon forgot all about it--all except me. I was left to my loneliness and my regrets.  "A year has now passed with no news from them. I write this on the anniversary of their departure. My friends, I know, are dead--somewhere! Oh, what an experience it has been! When your friends die and are buried it is hard enough but when they disappear in a flash and leave no token--! It is almost beyond endurance!"    CHAPTER II   A TRIP OF TERROR  I take up the story at the point where I dropped it to introduce Church's narrative.  As minute after minute elapsed and we continued in motion we changed our minds about the descent, and concluded that the inventor was going to give us a much longer ride than we had anticipated. We were startled and puzzled but not really alarmed, for the car traveled so smoothly that it gave one a sense of confidence. On the other hand, we felt a little indignation that Edmund should treat us like a lot of boys, without wills of our own. No doubt we had provoked him, though unintentionally, but this was going too far on his part. I am sure we were all hot with this feeling and presently Jack flamed out:  "Look here, Edmund," he exclaimed, dropping his customary good-natured manner, "this is carrying things with a pretty high hand. It's a good deal like kidnapping, it seems to me. I didn't give you permission to carry me off in this way, and I want to know what you mean by it and what you are about. I've no objection to making a little trip in your car, which is certainly mighty comfortable, but first I'd like to be asked whether I want to go or no."  Edmund shrugged his shoulders and made no reply. He was very busy just then with the metallic knobs. Suddenly we were jerked off our feet as if we had been in a trolley driven by a green motorman. Edmund also would have fallen if he had not clung to one of the handles. We felt that we were spinning through the air at a fearful speed. Still Edmund uttered not a word, but while we staggered upon our feet, and steadied ourselves with hands and knees on the leather-cushioned benches like so many drunken men, he continued pulling and pushing at his knobs. Finally the motion became more regular and it was evident that the car had slowed down from its wild rush.  "Excuse me," said Edmund, then, quite in his natural manner, "the thing is new yet and I've got to learn the stops by experience. But there's no occasion for alarm."  But our indignation had grown hotter with the shake-up that we had just had, and as usual Jack was spokesman for it:  "Maybe there is no occasion for alarm," he said excitedly, "but will you be kind enough to answer my question, and tell us what you're about and where we are going?"  And Henry, too, who was ordinarily as mute as a clam, broke out still more hotly:  "See here! I've had enough of this thing! Just go down and let me out. I won't be carried off so, against my will and knowledge."  By this time Edmund appeared to have got things in the shape he wanted, and he turned to face us. He always had a magnetism that was inexplicable, and now we felt it as never before. His features were perfectly calm, but there was a light in his eyes that seemed electric. As if disdaining to make a direct reply to the heated words of Jack and Henry he began in a quiet voice:  "It was my first intention to invite you to accompany me on a very interesting expedition. I knew that none of you had any ties of family or business to detain you, and I felt sure that you would readily consent. In case you should not, however, I had made up my mind to go alone. But you provoked me more than you knew, probably, at the club, and after we had entered the car, and, being myself hot-tempered, I determined to teach you a lesson. I have no intention, however, of abducting you. It is true that you are in my power at present, but if you now say that you do not wish to be concerned in what I assure you will prove the most wonderful enterprise ever undertaken by human beings, I will go back to the shed and let you out."  We looked at one another, in doubt what to reply until Jack, who, with all his impulsiveness had more of the milk of human kindness in his heart than anyone else I ever knew, seized Edmund's hand and exclaimed:  "All right, old boy, bygones are bygones; I'm with you. Now what do you fellows say?"  "I'm with you, too," I cried, yielding to the spur of Jack's enthusiasm and moved also by an intense curiosity. "I say go ahead."  Henry was more backward. But his curiosity, too, was aroused, and at length he gave in his voice with the others.  Jack swung his hat.  "Three cheers, then, for the modern Archimedes! You won't take that amiss now Edmund."  We gave the cheers, and I could see that Edmund was immensely pleased.  "And now," Jack continued, "tell us all about it. Where are we going?"  "Pardon me, Jack," was Edmund's reply, "but I'd rather keep that for a surprise. You shall know everything in good time; or at least everything that you can understand," he added, with a slightly malicious smile.  Feeling a little more interest than the others, perhaps, in the scientific aspects of the business, I asked Edmund to tell us something more about the nature of his wonderful invention. He responded with great good humor, but rather in the manner of a schoolmaster addressing pupils who, he knows, cannot entirely follow him.  "These knobs and handles on the walls," he said, "control the driving power, which, as I have told you, comes from the atoms of matter which I have persuaded to unlock their hidden forces. I push or turn one way and we go ahead, or we rise; I push or turn another way and we stop, or go back. So I concentrate the atomic force just as I choose. It makes us go, or it carries us back to earth, or it holds us motionless, according to the way I apply it. The earth is what I kick against at present, and what I hold fast by; but any other sufficiently massive body would serve the same purpose. As to the machinery, you'd need a special education in order to understand it. You'd have to study the whole subject from the bottom up, and go through all the experiments that I have tried. I confess that there are some things the fundamental reason of which I don't understand myself. But I know how to apply and control the power, and if I had Professor Thomson and Professor Rutherford here, I'd make them open their eyes. I wish I had been able to kidnap them."  "That's a confession that, after all, you've kidnapped us," put in Jack, smiling.  "If you insist upon stating it in that way--yes," replied Edmund, smiling also. "But you know that now you've consented."  "Perhaps you'll treat us to a trip to Paris," Jack persisted.  "Better than that," was the reply. "Paris is only an ant-hill in comparison with what you are going to see."  And so, indeed, it turned out!  Finally all got out their pipes, and we began to make ourselves at home, for truly, as far as luxurious furniture was concerned, we were as comfortable as at the Olympus Club, and the motion of the strange craft was so smooth and regular that it soothed us like an anodyne. It was only those unnamed, subtle senses which man possesses almost without being aware of their existence that assured us that we were in motion at all.  After we had smoked for an hour or so, talking and telling stories quite in the manner of the club, Edmund suddenly asked, with a peculiar smile:  "Aren't you a little surprised that this small room is not choking full of smoke? You know that the shutters are tightly closed."  "By Jo," exclaimed Jack, "that's so! Why here we've been pouring out clouds like old Vesuvius for an hour with no windows open, and yet the air is as clear as a bell."  "The smoke," said Edmund impressively, "has been turned into atomic energy to speed us on our way. I'm glad you're all good smokers, for that saves me fuel. Look," he continued, while we, amazed, stared at him, "those fellows there have been swallowing your smoke, and glad to get it."  He pointed at a row of what seemed to be grinning steel mouths, barred with innumerable black teeth, and half concealed by a projecting ledge at the bottom of the wall opposite the entrance, and as I looked I was thrilled by the sight of faint curls of smoke disappearing within their gaping jaws.  "They are omnivorous beasts," said Edmund. "They feed on the carbon from your breath, too. Rather remarkable, isn't it, that every time you expel the air from your lungs you help this car to go?"  None of us knew what to say; our astonishment was beyond speech. We began to look askance at Edmund, with creeping sensations about the spine. A formless, unacknowledged fear of him entered our souls. It never occurred to us to doubt the truth of what he had said. We knew him too well for that; and, then, were we not here, flying mysteriously through the air in a heavy metallic car that had no apparent motive power? For my part, instead of demanding any further explanations, I fell into a hazy reverie on the marvel of it all; and Jack and Henry must have been seized the same way, for not one of us spoke a word, or asked a question; while Edmund, satisfied, perhaps, with the impression he had made, kept equally quiet.  Thus another hour passed, and all of us, I think, had fallen into a doze, when Edmund aroused us by saying:  "I'll have to keep the first watch, and all the others, too, this night."  "So then we're not going to land to-night?"  "No, not to-night, and you may as well turn in. You see that I have prepared good, comfortable bunks, and I think you'll make out very well."  As Edmund spoke he lifted the tops from some of the benches along the walls, and revealed excellent beds, ready for occupancy.  "I believe that I have forgotten nothing that we shall really need," he added. "Beds, arms, instruments, books, clothing, furs, and good things to eat."  Again we looked at one another in surprise, but nobody spoke, although the same thought probably occurred to each--that this promised to be a pretty long trip, judging from the preparations. Arms! What in the world should we need of arms? Was he going to the Rocky Mountains for a bear hunt? And clothing, and furs!  But we were really sleepy, and none of us was very long in taking Edmund at his word and leaving him to watch alone. He considerately drew a shade over the light, and then noiselessly opened a shutter and looked out. When I saw that, I was strongly tempted to rise and take a look myself, but instead I fell asleep. My dreams were disturbed by visions of the grinning nondescripts at the foot of the wall, which transformed themselves into winged dragons, and remorselessly pursued me through the measureless abysses of space.  When I woke, windows were open on both sides of the car, and brilliant sunshine was streaming in through one of them. Henry was still asleep, Jack was yawning in his bunk, and Edmund stood at one of the windows staring out. I made a quick toilet, and hastened to Edmund's side.  "Good morning," he said heartily, taking my hand. "Look out here, and tell me what you think of the prospect."  As I put my face close to the thick but very transparent glass covering the window, my heart jumped into my mouth!  "In Heaven's name, where are we?" I cried out.  Jack, hearing my agitated exclamation, jumped out of his bunk and ran to the window also. He gasped as he gazed out, and truly it was enough to take away one's breath!  We appeared to be at an infinite elevation, and the sky, as black as ink, was ablaze with stars, although the bright sunlight was streaming into the opposite window behind us. I could see nothing of the earth. Evidently we were too high for that.  "It must lie away down under our feet," I murmured half aloud, "so that even the horizon has sunk out of sight. Heavens, what a height!"  I had that queer uncontrollable qualm that comes to every one who finds himself suddenly on the edge of a soundless deep.  Presently I became aware that straight before us, but afar off, was a most singular appearance in the sky. At first glance I thought that it was a cloud, round and mottled, But it was strangely changeless in form, and it had an unvaporous look.  "Phew!" whistled Jack, suddenly catching sight of it and fixing his eyes in a stare, "what's _that?_"  "_That's the earth!_"  It was Edmund who spoke, looking at us with a quizzical smile. A shock ran through my nerves, and for an instant my brain whirled. I saw that it was the truth that he had uttered, for, as sure as I sit here, his words had hardly struck my ears when the great cloud rounded out and hardened, the deception vanished, and I recognized, as clearly as ever I saw them on a school globe, the outlines of Asia and the Pacific Ocean!  In a second I had become too weak to stand, and I sank trembling upon a bench. But Jack, whose eyes had not accommodated themselves as rapidly as mine to the gigantic perspective, remained at the window, exclaiming:  "Fiddlesticks! What are you trying to give us? The earth is down below, I reckon."  But in another minute he, too, saw it as it really was, and his astonishment equaled mine. In fact he made so much noise about it that he awoke Henry, who, jumping out of bed, came running to see, and when we had explained to him where we were, sank upon a seat with a despairing groan and covered his face. Our astonishment and dismay were too great to permit us quickly to recover our self-command, but after a while Jack seized Edmund's arm, and demanded:  "For God's sake, tell us what you've been doing."  "Nothing that ought to appear very extraordinary," answered Edmund, with uncommon warmth. "If men had not been fools for so many ages they might have done this, and more than this long ago. It's enough to make one ashamed of his race! For countless centuries, instead of grasping the power that nature had placed at the disposal of their intelligence, they have idled away their time gabbling about nothing. And even since, at last, they have begun to do something, look at the time that they have wasted upon such petty forces as steam and 'electricity,' burning whole mines of coal and whole lakes of oil, and childishly calling upon winds and tides and waterfalls to help them, when they had under their thumbs the limitless energy of the atoms, and no more understood it than a baby understands what makes its whistle scream! It's inter-atomic force that has brought us out here, and that is going to carry us a great deal farther."  We simply listened in silence; for what could we say? The facts were more eloquent than any words, and called for no commentary. Here we _were_, out in the middle of space; and _there_ was the earth, hanging on nothing, like a summer cloud. At least we knew where we were if we didn't quite understand how we had got there.  Seeing us speechless, Edmund resumed in a different tone:  "We made a fairly good run during the night. You must be hungry by this time, for you've slept late; suppose we have breakfast."  So saying, he opened a locker, took out a folding table, covered it with a white cloth, turned on something resembling a little electric range, and in a few minutes had ready as appetizing a breakfast of eggs and as good a cup of coffee as I ever tasted. It is one of the compensations of human nature that it is able to adjust itself to the most unheard-of conditions provided only that the inner man is not neglected. The smell of breakfast would almost reconcile a man to purgatory--anyhow it reconciled us for the time being to our unparalleled situation, and we ate and drank, and indulged in as cheerful good comradeship as that of a fishing party in the wilderness after a big morning's catch.  When the breakfast was finished we began to chat and smoke, which reminded me of those gulping mouths under the wainscot, and I leaned down to catch a glimpse of their rows of black fangs, thinking to ask Edmund for further explanation about them; but the sight gave me a shiver, and I felt the hopelessness of trying to understand their function.  Then we took a turn at looking out of the window to see the earth. Edmund furnished us with binoculars which enabled us to recognize many geographical features of our planet. The western shore of the Pacific was now in plain sight, and a few small spots, near the edge of the ocean, we knew to be Japan and the Philippines. The snowy Himalayas showed as a crinkling line, and a huge white smudge over the China Sea indicated where a storm was raging and where good ships, no doubt, were battling with the tossing waves.  After a time I noticed that Edmund was continually going from one window to the other and looking out with an air of anxiety. He seemed to be watching for something, and there was a look of mingled expectation and apprehension in his eyes. He had a peephole at the forward end of the car and another in the floor, and these he frequently visited. I now recalled that even while we were at breakfast he had seemed uneasy and occasionally left his seat to look out. At last I asked him:  "What are you looking for, Edmund?"  "Meteors."  "Meteors, out here!"  "Of course. You're something of an astronomer; don't you know that they hang about all the planets? They didn't give me any rest last night. I was on tender hooks all the time while you were sleeping. I was half inclined to call one of you to help me. We passed some pretty ugly fellows while you slept, I can tell you! You know that this is an unexplored sea that we are navigating, and I don't want to run on the rocks."  "But we seem to be a good way off from the earth now," I remarked, "and there ought not to be much danger."  "It's not as dangerous as it was, but there may be some of them yet around here. I'll feel safer when we have put a few more million miles behind us."  _A few more million miles!_ We all stood aghast when we heard the words. We had, indeed, imagined that the earth looked as if it might be a million miles away, but, then, it was merely a passing impression, which had given us no sense of reality; but now when we heard Edmund say that we actually had traveled such a distance, the idea struck us with overwhelming force.  "In the name of all that's good, Edmund," cried Jack, "at what rate are we traveling, then?"  "Just at present," Edmund replied, glancing at an indicator, "we're making twenty miles a second."  _Twenty miles a second!_ Our excited nerves had another shock.  "Why," I exclaimed, "that's faster than the earth moves in its orbit!"  "Yes, a trifle faster; but I'll probably have to work up to a little better speed in order to get where I want to go before our goal begins to run away from us."  "Ah, there you are," said Jack. "That's what I wanted to know. What is our goal? Where are we going?"  Before Edmund could reply we all sprang to our feet in affright. A loud grating noise had broken upon our ears. At the same instant the car gave a lurch, and a blaze of the most vicious lightning streamed through a window.  "Confound the things!" shouted Edmund, springing to the window, and then darting to one of his knobs and beginning to twist it with all his force.  In a second we were sprawling on the floor--all except Edmund, who kept his hold on the knob. Our course had been changed with amazing quickness, and our startled eyes beheld a huge misshapen object darting past the window.  "Here comes another!" cried Edmund, again seizing the knob.  I had managed to get my face to the window, and I certainly thought that we were done for. Apparently only a few rods away, and rushing straight at the car, was a vast black mass, shaped something like a dumb-bell, with ends as big as houses, tumbling over and over, and threatening us with annihilation. If it hit us, as it seemed sure that it would do, I knew that we should never return to the earth, unless in the form of pulverized ashes!    CHAPTER III   THE PLANETARY LIMITED  But Edmund had seen the meteor sooner than I, and as quick as thought he swerved the car, and threw us all off our feet once more. But we should have been thankful if he had broken our heads, since he had saved us from instant destruction.  The danger, however, was not yet passed. Scarcely had the immense dumb-bell (which Edmund declared must have been composed of solid iron, so great was its effect on his needles) disappeared, before there came from outside a blaze so fierce that it fairly slapped our lids shut.  "A collision!" Edmund exclaimed. "The thing has struck another big meteor, and they are exchanging fiery compliments."  He threw himself flat on the floor, and stared out of the peephole. Then he jumped to his feet and gave us another tumble.  "They're all about us," he faltered, breathless with exertion; then, having drawn a deep inspiration, he continued: "We're like a boat in a raging freshet, with rocks, tree trunks, and cakes of ice threatening it on all sides. But we'll get out of it. The car obeys its helm as if it appreciated the danger. Why, I got away from that last fellow by setting up atomic reaction against it, as a boatman pushes with his pole."  Even in the midst of our terror we could not but admire our leader. His resources seemed boundless, and our confidence in him grew with every escape. While he kept guard at the peepholes we watched for meteors from the windows. We must have come almost within striking distance of a thousand in the course of an hour, but Edmund decided not to diminish our speed, for he said that he could control the car quicker when it was under full headway.  So on we rushed, dodging the things like a crow in a flock of pestering jays, and we really enjoyed the excitement. It was more fascinating sport than shooting rapids in a careening skiff, and at last we grew so confident in the powers of our car and its commander that we were rather sorry when the last meteor passed, and we found ourselves once more in open, unimpeded space.  After that the time passed quietly. We ate our meals and went to bed and rose as regularly as if we had been at home. In one respect, however, things were very different from what they were on the earth. We had no night! The sun shone continually, although the sky was black and always glittering with stars. None of us needed to be told by our conductor that this was due to the fact that we no longer had the shadow of the earth to make night for us when the sun was behind it. The sun was now never behind the earth, or any other great opaque body, and when we wished to sleep we made an artificial night, for our special use, by closing all the shutters. And there was no atmosphere about us to diffuse the sunlight, and so to hide the stars. We kept count of the days by the aid of a calendar clock; there seemed to be nothing that Edmund had forgotten. And it was a delightful experience, the wonder of which grew upon us hour by hour. It was too marvelous, too incredible, to be believed, and yet--_there we were!_  Once the idea suddenly came to me that it was astonishing that we had not long ago perished for lack of oxygen. I understood, of course, from what Edmund had said, that the mysterious machines along the wall absorbed the carbonic acid, but we must be constantly using up the oxygen. When I put my difficulty before Edmund he laughed.  "That's the easiest thing of all," he said. "Look here."  He threw open a little grating.  "In there," he continued, "there's an apparatus which manufactures just enough oxygen to keep the air in good condition. It is supplied with materials to last a month, which will be much longer than this expedition will take."  "There you are again," exclaimed Jack. "I was asking you about that when we ran into those pesky meteors. What _is_ this expedition? Where are we going, anyway?"  "Well," Edmund replied, "since we have become pretty good shipmates, I don't see any objection to telling you. We are going to Venus."  "Going to Venus!" we all cried in a breath.  "To be sure. Why not? We've got the proper sort of conveyance, haven't we?"  There was no denying that. Our conveyance had already brought us some millions of miles out into space; why, indeed, should it not be able to carry us to Venus, or any other planet?  "How far is it to Venus?" asked Jack.  "When we quit the earth," Edmund answered, "Venus was rapidly approaching inferior conjunction. You know what that is," addressing me, "it's when the planet comes between the sun and the earth. The distance from the earth is not always the same at such a conjunction, but I figured out that on this occasion, after allowing for the circuit we should have to make, there would be just twenty-seven million miles to travel. At an average speed of twenty miles a second we could do that distance in fifteen days, fourteen and one half hours. But, of course, I had to lose some time going slow through the earth's atmosphere, for otherwise the car would have taken fire, like a meteor, on account of the friction. Then, too, I shall have to slow up on entering the atmosphere of Venus, which appears to be very deep and dense; so, upon the whole, I don't count on landing upon Venus in less than sixteen days from the time of our departure. We've already been out five days, and within eleven more I expect to introduce you to the inhabitants of another world."  The inhabitants of another world! Again Edmund had thrown out an idea which took us all aback.  "Do you believe there are any inhabitants on Venus?" I asked at length.  "Certainly. I know there are."  "For sure," put in Jack, stretching out his legs and pulling at his pipe. "Who'd go twenty-seven million miles to pay a visit if he didn't know there was somebody at home?"  "Then that's what you put the arms aboard for," I remarked.  "Yes, but I hope we shall not have to use them."  "Strikes me that this is a sort of pirate ship," said Jack. "But what kind of arms have you got, Edmund?"  For answer Edmund threw open a locker and showed us a gleaming array of automatic guns and pistols and even some cutlasses.  "Decidedly piratical!" exclaimed the incorrigible Jack. "You'd better hoist the black flag. But, see here, Edmund, with all this inter-atomic energy that you talk about, why in the world didn't you invent something new--something that would just knock the Venustians silly, and blow their old planet up if necessary? Automatic arms are pretty good at home, on that unprogressive earth that you have spurned with your heels, but they'll likely be rather small pumpkins on Venus."  "I didn't prepare anything else," Edmund replied, "because, in the first place, I was too busy with more important things, and in the second place because I don't really anticipate that we shall have any use for arms. I only took these as a precaution."  "You mean to try moral suasion, I suppose," drawled Jack. "Well, anyhow, I hope they'll be glad to see us, and since it is Venus that we are going to visit, I don't look for much fighting. I'm glad you made it Venus instead of Mars, Edmund, for, from all I've heard of Mars with its fourteen-foot giants, I don't think I should like to try the pirate business in that direction."  We all laughed at Jack's fancies; but there was something tremendously thrilling in the idea. Think of landing on another world! Think of meeting inhabitants there! Really, it made one's head spin.  "Confound it, this is all a dream," I said to myself. "I'm on my back in bed with a nightmare. I'll kick myself awake."  But do what I would I could make no dream of it. On the contrary, I felt that I had never been quite so much awake in all my life before.  After a while we all settled down to take the thing in earnest. And then the charm of it began to master our imaginations. We talked over the prospects in all their aspects. Edmund said little, and Henry nothing, but Jack and I were stirred to the bottom of our romantic souls. Henry was different. He had no romance in his make-up. He always looked at the money in a thing. To his mind, going to Venus was playing the fool, when we had at our command the means of owning the earth.  "Edmund," he said, after mumbling for a while under his breath, "this is the most utter tomfoolery that ever I heard of. Here you've got an invention that would revolutionize mechanics, and instead of utilizing it you rush off into space on a hairbrained adventure. You might have been twenty times a billionaire inside of a year if you had stayed at home and developed the thing. Why, it's folly; pure, beastly folly! Going to Venus! What can you make on Venus?"  Edmund only smiled. After a little he said:  "Well, I'm sorry for you, Henry. But then you're cut out on the ordinary pattern. But cheer up. When we go back, perhaps I'll let you take out a patent, and you can make the billions. For my part, Venus is more interesting to me than all the money you could pile up between the Atlantic Ocean and the Rocky Mountains. Why," he continued, warming up, and straightening with a certain pride which he had, "am I not the Columbus of Space?--And you my lieutenants," he added, with a smile.  "Right you are," cried Jack enthusiastically. "The Columbus of Space, that's the ticket! Where's old Archimedes now? Buried, by Jo! _He_ couldn't go to Venus! And what need we care for your billionaires?"  Edmund patted Jack on the back, and I rather sympathized with his enthusiasm myself.  The time ran on, and we watched anxiously the day-hand of the calendar clock. Soon it had marked a week; then ten days; then a fortnight. We knew we must be getting very close to our goal, yet up to this time neither Jack, nor Henry, nor I had caught a glimpse of Venus. Edmund, however, had seen it, but he told us that in order to do so he had been obliged to alter our course because the planet was directly in the eye of the sun. In consequence of the change of course we were now approaching Venus from the east--flanking her, so to speak--and Edmund described her appearance as that of an enormous crescent. Finally he invited us to take a look for ourselves.  I shall never forget that first view! It was only a glimpse, for Edmund was nervous about meteors again, and would allow us only a moment at the peephole because he wished to be continually on the watch himself. But, brief as was the view, that vast gleaming sickle hanging in the black sky was the most tremendous thing I ever looked upon!  Soon afterwards Edmund changed the course again, and then we saw her no more. We had not come upon the swarms of meteors that Edmund had expected to find lurking about the planet, and he said that he now felt safe in running into her shadow, and making a landing on her night hemisphere. You will allow me to remind you that Schiaparelli had long before found out that Venus doesn't turn on her axis once every twenty-four hours, like the earth, but keeps always the same face to the sun; the consequence being that she has perpetual day on one side and perpetual night on the other. I asked Edmund why he should not rather land on the daylight side; but he replied that his plan was safer, and that we could easily go from one side to the other whenever we chose. It didn't turn out to be so easy after all, but that is another part of the story.  "I hardly expect to find any inhabitants on the night side," Edmund remarked, "for it must be fearfully cold there--too cold for life to exist, perhaps; but I have provided against that as far as we are concerned. Still, one can never tell. There _may_ be inhabitants there, and at any rate I am going to find out. If there are none, we'll just stop long enough to take a look at things, and then the car will quickly transport us to the daylight hemisphere, where life certainly exists. By landing on the uninhabited side, you see, we shall have a chance to reconnoiter a little, and can approach the inhabitants on the other side so much the more safely."  "That sounds all right enough," said Jack, "but if Venus is correctly named, I'm for getting where the inhabitants are as quick as possible."  When we swung round into the shadow of the planet we got her between the sun and ourselves, and as she completely hid the sun, we now had perpetual night about the car. Out of the peephole she looked like a stupendous black circle, blacker than the sky itself, but round the rim was a beautiful ring of light.  "That's her atmosphere," Edmund explained, "lighted up by the sun from behind. But, for the life of me, I cannot tell what those immense flames mean."  He referred to a vast circle of many-colored spires that blazed and flickered like a burning rainbow at the inner edge of the ring of light. It was one of the most awful, and yet beautiful, sights that I had ever gazed upon.  "That's something altogether outside my calculations," Edmund added. "I can't account for it at all."  "Perhaps they are already celebrating our arrival with fireworks," suggested Jack, always ready to take the humorous view of everything.  "That's not fire," Edmund responded earnestly. "But what it is I confess I can't imagine. We'll find out, however, for I haven't come all this distance to be scared off."  And here I must try to explain a very curious thing which had puzzled our senses, though not our understanding (because Edmund had promptly explained it), throughout the voyage, and that was--levitation.  On our first day out from the earth, we began to notice the remarkable ease with which we handled things, and the strange tendency we had to bump into one another because we seemed to be all the time employing more strength than was necessary and almost to be able to walk on air. Jack declared that he felt as if his head had become a toy balloon.  "It's the lack of weight," said Edmund. "Every time we double our distance from the earth we lose another three quarters of our weight. If I had thought to bring along a spring dynamometer, I could have shown you, Jack, that when we were 4,000 miles above the earth's surface the 200 good pounds with which you depress the scales at home had diminished to 50, and that when we had passed about 150,000 miles into space you weighed no more than a couple of ounces. From that point on, it has been the attraction of the sun to which we have owed whatever weight we had, and the floor of the car has been toward the sun, because, at that distance from the earth, the latter ceases to exercise the master force, and the pull of the sun becomes greater than the earth's. But as we approach Venus the latter begins to restore our weight, and when we arrive on her surface we shall weigh about four fifths as much as when we started from the earth."  "But I don't look as if I had lost any avoirdupois," said Jack, glancing at his round limbs. "And when you give us a fling I seem to strike pretty hard, though in other respects I confess I do feel a good deal like an angel."  "Ah," said Edmund, laughing, "that's the _inertia of mass_. Your mass is the same, although your weight has almost disappeared. Weight depends upon the distance from the attracting body, but mass is independent of everything."  "Do you mean to say that angels are massive?"  "They may be as massive as they like provided they keep well away from great centers of gravitation."  "But Venus is such a center--then there can't be any angels there."  "I hope to find something better than angels," was Edmund's smiling reply.  Now, as we drew near to Venus, the truth of Edmund's statements became apparent. We felt that our weight was returning, and our muscular activity sinking back to the normal again. We imagined that every minute we could feel our feet pressing more heavily upon the floor.  Our approach was so rapid that the immense black circle grew visibly minute by minute. Soon it was so large that we could no longer see its boundaries through the peephole in the floor.  "We're now within a thousand miles," said Edmund, "and must be close to the upper limits of the atmosphere. I'll have to slow down, or else we'll be burnt up by the heat of friction."  He proceeded to slow down a little more rapidly than was comfortable. It was jerk after jerk, as he dropped off the power, and put on the brakes, but at last we got down to the speed of a fast express train. Soon we were so close that the surface of the planet became dimly visible, simply from the starlight. We were now settling down very cautiously, and presently we began to notice curious shafts of light which appeared to issue from the ground, as if the surface beneath us had been sprinkled with iron founderies.  "Aha!" cried Edmund, "I believe there _are_ inhabitants on this side after all. Those lights don't come from volcanoes. I'm going to make for the nearest one, and we'll soon know what they are."  Accordingly we steered for one of the gleaming shafts. It was a thrilling moment, I can tell you--that when we first saw another world than ours under our feet! As we approached the light it threw a pale illumination on the ground around. Everything appeared to be perfectly flat and level. It was like dropping down at night upon a vast prairie. But the features of the landscape were indistinguishable in the gloom. Edmund boldly continued to approach until we were within a hundred feet of the shaft of light, which we could now perceive issued directly from the ground. Suddenly, with the slightest perceptible bump, we touched the soil, and the car came to rest. We had landed on Venus!  "It's unquestionably frightfully cold outside," said Edmund, "and we'll now put on these things."  He dragged out of one of his many lockers four suits of thick fur garments, and as many pairs of fur gloves, together with caps and shields for the face, leaving only narrow openings for the eyes. When we had got them on we looked like so many Esquimaux. Finally Edmund handed each of us a pair of small automatic pistols, telling us to put them where they would be handy in our side pockets.  "Boarders all!" cried the irrepressible Jack. "Pirates, do your duty!"  Our preparations being made, we opened the door. The air that rushed in almost hardened us into icicles!  "It won't hurt you," said Edmund in a whisper. "It can't be down to absolute zero on account of the dense atmosphere. You'll get used to it in a few minutes. Come on."  His whispering gave us a sense of imminent danger, but nevertheless we followed as he led the way straight toward the shaft of light. On nearing it we saw that it came out of an irregularly round hole in the ground. When we got yet nearer we were astonished to see rough steps which led down into the pit. The next instant we were frozen in our tracks! For a moment my heart stopped beating.  Standing on the steps, just below the level of the ground, and intently watching us, with eyes as big and luminous as moons, was a creature shaped like a man, but more savage than a gorilla!    CHAPTER IV   THE CAVERNS OF VENUS  For two or three minutes the creature continued to stare at us, motionless; and we stared at him. It was so dramatic that it makes my nerves tingle now when I think of it. His eyes alone were enough to harrow up your soul. Huge beyond belief, round and luminous as full moons, they were filled with the phosphorescent greenish-yellow glare that sometimes appears in the expanded pupils of a cat or a wild beast. The great hairy head was black, but the stocky body was as white as a polar bear. The arms were apelike and very long and muscular, and the entire aspect of the creature betokened immense strength and activity.  Edmund was the first to recover from the stupor of surprise, and instantly he did a thing so apparently absurd but so marvelous in its calculated effect that no brain but his could have conceived it. It shakes me at once with laughter and recollected terror when I recall it.  "WELL, HELLO YOU!" he called out in a voice of such stentorian power that we jumped as at a thunderclap. The effect on the strange brute was electric. A film shot across the big eyes, he leaped into the air, uttering a squeak that was ridiculous, coming from an animal of such size and strength, and instantly disappeared, tumbling down the steps.  But we were as much frightened as the ugly monster himself. We stared at Edmund, speechless in our amazement. Never could I have believed it possible for such a voice to issue from the human throat. It was not the voice of our friend, nor the voice of a man at all, but an indescribable clangor; and the words I have quoted had been scarcely distinguishable, so shattered were they by the crash of sound that whirled them into our astonished ears. Edmund, seeing us gaping in speechless wonder, laughed with such an appearance of hearty enjoyment as I had never known him to exhibit--and his merriment produced another thunderous explosion that shook the air.  Then the truth burst upon me, and I exclaimed:  "It's the atmosphere!"  I had not spoken very loudly, but the words seemed to reverberate in my mouth, as if to testify to the correctness of my explanation.  "Yes," said Edmund, taking pains to moderate his voice, "you've hit it, it's the atmosphere. I had calculated on an effect of the kind, but the reality exceeds all that I had anticipated. Spectroscopic analysis as well as telescopic appearances demonstrated long ago that the atmosphere of Venus was extraordinarily extensive and dense, from which fact I inferred that we should encounter some wonderful acoustic phenomena here, and this was in my mind when, on stepping out of the car, I addressed you in a whisper. The reaction even of the whisper on my organs of speech told me that I was right, and showed me what to expect if the full power of the voice were used. When we caught sight of the creature at the top of the pit I had no desire to shoot him, and I saw that he was too powerful to be captured alive. In a second I had decided what to do. It ran through my mind that, in a world where the density, and probably something also in the peculiar constitution of the air, had the effect of vastly magnifying sound, the phonetic and acoustic organs of the inhabitants would be modified, and that the sounds uttered by them would be much fainter than those that we are accustomed to hear from living creatures on the earth. That being so, I argued that a very great and heavy sound coming from a strange animal would produce in the creature before us a paralyzing terror. You have seen that it did so. I expect that this will give us an immense advantage to begin with. We have already inspired so great a fear that I believe that we can now safely follow the creature into its habitation, and encounter without danger any of its congeners that may be there. Nevertheless, I shall not ask you to run any risks, and I will alone descend into the pit."  "If you do, may I be hanged for sheep stealing!"  You will guess at once that it was Jack who had spoken thus.  "No, sir," he continued, "if you go, we all go. Isn't that so, boys?"  In answer to an appeal thus put, neither Henry nor myself could have hung back even if we had had the disposition to do so. But I believe that we all instinctively felt that our place was by Edmund's side, wherever he might choose to go.  "Go ahead, then, Edmund," Jack added, seeing that we consented, "we're with you." And then his enthusiasm taking fire, as usual, he exclaimed: "Hurrah! Columbus forever! We've conquered a hemisphere with a blank shot."  And so we began our descent into the mysterious pit. The strange light that came from it, and formed a shaft in the dense atmosphere above like sunlight in a haymow, was accompanied by a considerable degree of heat, which was very grateful to our lungs after the frigid plunge that we had taken from the comfortable car. As we descended, the temperature continually rose until we were glad to throw off our Arctic togs, and leave them on a shelf of rock to await our return. But, fortunately, we did not forget to take the pistols from the pockets before leaving the garments. I am very uncertain what would have been the future course of our history if we had neglected this precaution.  It was an awful hole for depth. The steps, rudely cut, wound round and round the sides like those in a cathedral tower, but the pit was not perfectly circular. It looked like a natural formation, such as the vertical entrance to a limestone cavern, or the throat of a sleeping volcano. But whatever the nature of the pit might be, I was convinced that the steps were of artificial origin. They were reasonably regular in height and broad enough for two, or even three, persons to go abreast.  When we had descended perhaps as much as two hundred feet, we suddenly found ourselves in a broad cavern with a surprisingly level floor. The temperature had been steadily rising all the time, and here it was as warm as in an ordinary living room. The cavern appeared to be about twenty yards broad and eight or ten feet in height, with a flat roof of rock. It was dimly illuminated by a small heap of what seemed to be hard coal, burning in a very roughly constructed brazier, which, as far as looks went, one would have said was constructed of iron.  You will imagine our surprise upon seeing these things. The appearance of the gorilla-like beast with the awful eyes had certainly not led us to anticipate the finding in his lair of any such evidences of human intelligence, and we stood fast in our tracks for a minute or two, nobody speaking a word. Then Edmund said:  "This is far better than I hoped. I had not thought about caverns, though I ought to have foreseen the probability of something of the kind. It is hard to drive out life as long as a world has solid foundations, and air for breathing. I shall be greatly surprised now if these creatures do not turn out to be at least as intelligent as our African or Australian savages."  "But," said I, "the fellow that we saw surely cannot have more intelligence than a beast. There must be some more highly developed creatures living here."  "I'm not so sure of that," Edmund responded. "Looks go for nothing in such a case. He had arms and hands, and his brain may be well organized."  "If his brain is as big as his eyes," Jack put in, "he ought to be able to give odds to old Solomon and beat him easy. My, but I'd like to see their spectacles--if they ever wear any!"  Jack's humor recalled us from our meditation, and we began to look about more carefully. There was not a living creature in sight, but over in a corner I detected a broad hole, down which the steps continued to descend.  "Here's the way," said Edmund, discovering the steps at the same moment. "Down we go."  He again led the way, and we resumed the descent. As we stumbled along downward we began to talk of a strange but agreeable odor which we had noticed in the cavern. Edmund said that it was due, perhaps, to some peculiar quality of the atmosphere.  "I think," he continued, "that it is heavily charged with oxygen. You have noticed that none of us feels the slightest fatigue, notwithstanding the precipitancy of our long descent."  I reflected that this might also be the cause of our rising courage, for I was sure that not one of us felt the slightest fear in thus pushing on toward dangers of whose nature we could form no idea. The steps, precisely like those above, wound round and round and led us down I should say as much as three hundred feet before we entered another cavern, larger and loftier than the first.  And there we found them!  There was never another such sight! It made our blood run cold once more, rather with surprise than fear, though the latter quickly followed.  Ranged along the farther side of the cavern, and visible in the light of another glowing heap in the center, were as many as thirty of those huge hairy creatures, standing shoulder to shoulder, their great eyes glaring like bull's-eye lanterns. But the thing that filled us with terror was their motions.  You have read, with thrilling nerves, how a huge cobra, reared on his coils, sways his terrible head from side to side before striking. Well, all those black heads before us were swaying in unison, but with a sickening circular movement, which was regularly reversed in direction. Three times by the right and then three times by the left those heads circled, in rhythmic cadence, while the luminous eyes seemed to leave phosphorescent rings in the air, intersecting one another in consequence of the rapidity of the motion.  It was such a spectacle as I had never beheld in the wildest dream. It was baleful. It was the charm of the serpent fascinating his terrified prey. In an instant I felt my brain turning, and I staggered in spite of my utmost efforts. A kind of paralysis stiffened my limbs.  Presently, all moving together, and uttering a hissing, whistling sound, they began slowly to approach us, keeping in line, each shaggy leg lifted at the same moment, like so many soldiers on parade, while the heads continued to swing, and the glowing eyes to cut linked circles in the air. But for Edmund we should certainly have been lost. Standing a little to the fore, he spoke to us over his shoulder, in a low voice:  "Take out your pistols, but don't shoot unless they make a rush. Then kill as many as you can. I'll knock over the leader in the center, and I think that will be enough."  We could as easily have stirred our arms if we had been marble statues, but he promptly raised his pistol, and the explosion followed on the instant. The report was like an earthquake. It shocked us into our senses and almost out of them again. The weight of the air and the confinement of the cavern magnified and concentrated the sound so that it was awful beyond belief. The fellow in the center was hurled back as if shot from a catapult, and the others fell at flat as he, and lay there groveling, their big eyes filming and swaying, but no longer in unison.  The charm was broken, and as we saw our fearful enemies prostrate, our courage returned at a bound.  "I thought as much," said Edmund coolly. "But I'm sorry now that I aimed at that fellow; the sound alone would have sufficed. It was not necessary to take life. However, we should probably have had to come to it eventually, and now we have them thoroughly cowed. Our safety consists in keeping them terrified."  Thus speaking, Edmund boldly approached the groveling row, and pushed with his foot the furry body of the one he had shot. The bullet had gone through his head. At Edmund's approach the creatures sank lower on the rocky floor, and those nearest him turned up their moon eyes with an expression of submission and supplication that was grotesque. He motioned us to join him and, imitating him, we began to pat and smooth the shrinking bodies until, understanding that we would not hurt them, they gradually acquired confidence.  In the meantime the crowd in the cavern increased, others coming in through side passages, and exhibiting the utmost astonishment at the spectacle which greeted them. It was clear that those who had taken part in the opening scene imparted to the newcomers a knowledge of the situation of affairs, and we could see that our prestige was thoroughly established. It remained to utilize our advantage, and we looked to Edmund to show how it should be done. He was equal to the undertaking, but I shall not trouble you with the details of his diplomacy. Let it suffice to say that by a combination of gentleness and firmness he quickly reduced almost the entire population of the caverns (for, as we afterwards discovered, there were a dozen or more of these underground dwellings connected by horizontal passages through the rocks) into subjection to his will. I say "almost," because, as you will see in a little while, there were certain members of this extraordinary community who possessed a spirit of independence too strong to be so easily subdued.  As we became better acquainted with the cave dwellers we found that they were by no means as savage as they looked. Their appearance was certainly grotesque, and even unaccountable. Why, for instance, should their heads have been covered with coarse black disordered hair while their bodies, from the neck down, were almost beautiful with a natural raiment of golden white, as soft as silk and as brilliant as floss? I never could explain it, and Edmund was no less puzzled by this peculiarity. The immense size of their eyes did not seem astonishing after we began to reflect upon the consequences of the relative lack of light in their world. It was but a natural adjustment to their environment; with such eyes they could see in the dark better than cats. Their feet were bare and covered on the soles with thick soft skin, while the insides of their long hands were almost as white and delicate as those of a human being.  Their intelligence was sufficiently demonstrated by the construction of the hundreds of rocky steps leading from the caverns to the surface of the ground, and by their employment of fire, and manufacture of the metallic braziers which contained it. But this was not all. We found that in some of the winding passages connecting the caverns they cultivated food. It consisted entirely of vegetables of various kinds, and all unlike any that I ever saw on the earth. Water dripped from the roofs of these particular passages, and the almost colorless vegetation thrived there with astonishing luxuriance. They had many simple ways of cooking their food, and it was evident that they possessed some form of salt, though we did not discover the deposit from which they must have drawn it. They collected water in cisterns hollowed in the rock.  Although we still had abundance of food in the car, Edmund insisted on trying theirs, and it proved to be very palatable.  "This is fortunate, though hardly surprising," said Edmund. "If we had found the food on Venus uneatable, we should indeed have been in a fine fix. While we remain here we will eat as the natives eat, and save our own supplies for future need."  The only brute animals that we saw in the caverns were some doglike creatures, about as large as terriers, but very furry, which showed the utmost terror whenever we appeared.  One of the first things that we discovered outside the main cavern where we had made our debut was the burial ground of the community. This happened when they came to dispose of the fellow that Edmund had shot. They formed a regular procession, which greatly impressed us, and we followed them as they bore the body through several winding ways into a large cavern, at a considerable distance from any of the others. Here they had dug a grave, and, to our astonishment, there appeared to be something resembling a religious ceremony connected with the interment. And then, for the first time, we distinguished the females from the others. But a still greater surprise awaited us. It was no less than plain evidence of regular family relationship.  As the body was lowered into the grave one of the females approached with every sign of distress and sorrow. Jack declared that he saw tears running down her hairy cheeks. She held two little ones by the hand, and this spectacle produced an astonishing effect upon Edmund, revealing an entirely new side of his character. I have told you that he expressed regret for having killed the fellow in the cavern, but now, at the sight before him, he seemed filled with remorse.  "I wish I had never come here!" he said bitterly. "The first thing I have done is to kill an inoffensive and intelligent creature."  "Intelligent, perhaps," said Jack, "but inoffensive--not by a long shot! Where'd we have been if you hadn't killed him? They'd have made mincemeat of us."  "No," replied Edmund, sorrowfully shaking his head, "it wasn't necessary. The noise would have sufficed; and I ought to have known it."  "Why didn't you shout, then? That scared the first one," put in Henry, whose soul, it must be said, was not overflowing with sympathy.  "I did what I thought was best at the moment," Edmund replied, with a broken voice. "They were so many and so threatening that I imagined my voice alone might not be effective. But I'm sorry, sorry!"  "Henry, you're a fool!" cried the sympathetic Jack. "Come now, Edmund," he continued, kindly laying a hand on his shoulder, "what you did was the only thing under heaven that could have been done. You're wrong to blame yourself. By Jo, if you hadn't done it I would!"  But Edmund only shook his head, as if refusing to be comforted. It was the first sign of weakness that we had seen in our incomparable leader, but I am sure it only increased our respect for him--at least that's true of Jack and me. After that I noticed that Edmund was far more gentle than before in his relations with the people of the caverns.  Not long after this painful incident we made a discovery of extreme interest. It was nothing less than a big smithy! Edmund had foretold that we should find something of the kind.  "Those braziers and cooking pots," he had said, "and the tools that must have been needed to build the steps and to dig their graves, prove that they know how to work in iron. If it is not done in these caverns, then they get it from some other similar community. But I think it likely that we shall come upon some signs of the work hereabouts."  "Maybe they import it from Pittsburg," was the remark that fun-loving Jack could not refrain from making.  "Well, you'll see," said Edmund.  And, as I have already told you, he was right. We did find the smithy, with several stout fellows pounding out rude tools with equally rude hammers of iron. Of course we could ask them no questions, for their language was only a kind of squeak, and they seemed to converse mostly by means of expressive signs. But Edmund was not long in drawing his conclusions.  "This," he said, after closely examining the metal, "is native iron. There's nothing remarkable in the fact that it should be here. All the solid planets, as you know" (turning to me), "are very largely composed of iron, and Venus, being nearer the center of the system, may have proportionally more of it than the earth. And these fellows have found out its usefulness, and how to work it. There's nothing surprising in that, either, for some of our savages have done as much on the earth. Now I'll make another prediction--we are going to find coal here. That is inevitable, since we know that they burn it in the caverns. I shouldn't wonder if it were close at hand, from the look of these rocks."  He approached the wall of the cavern containing the smithy, and immediately exclaimed:  "Look here! Here it is!"  And sure enough, on joining him we saw a seam of as fine anthracite as Pennsylvania ever produced.  "A Carboniferous Age on Venus!" Edmund continued. "What do you think of that? But, of course, it was sure to be so; all the planets that are old enough have been through practically the same stages. Think of it! The plants that gave origin to this coal must have flourished here when Venus still rotated on her axis rapidly enough to have day and night succeeding one another on all sides of her, for now no vegetation except the insignificant plants that grow in these caverns can live on this hemisphere. And think, too, of the countless ages that must have been consumed in slowing down her rotation by the friction of her ocean tides."  "Has Venus got any oceans?" asked Jack.  "I haven't a doubt of it; but we shall find none on this side, although they must once have been here."  We all mused for a time on the subject that Edmund had started, when suddenly his face lighted up with the greatest animation, and he exclaimed, but as if speaking to himself rather than to us:  "Capital! It couldn't have happened better!"  "What's capital?" drawled Jack.  "Why, this smithy, and these Tubal Cains here. Unconsciously they have solved for me a problem that has given me considerable trouble. Almost as soon as we got acquainted with the people of the caverns the idea occurred to me that I should like to take some of them with us when we visit the other hemisphere. There are many interesting observations that their presence on that side of Venus would give rise to, and, besides, they might be of great use to us. Of course I meant to bring them back to their home. But the puzzling question has been how to transport them. The car has a full load already."  "They've got good legs; make 'em walk," said Jack.  Edmund burst into a laugh.  "Why, Jack," he asked, "how far do you think it is to the other side of Venus?"  "I don't know," said Jack, "but I suppose it's not very far round her. How far is it?"  "Five thousand miles, at least, to the edge of the sunlit hemisphere."  Jack whistled.  "By Jo! I wouldn't have believed it."  "Well, it's a fact," said Edmund, "and of course I don't propose to take several months to make the journey. Now the sight of these fellows at work has shown me just how it can be done in short order. It's this way: I'll have iron sleds made, put the natives that I propose to take along upon them, hitch them by wire cables, which luckily I've got, to the car, and away we'll spin. The power of the car is practically unlimited, and, as you have observed, the ground is as flat and smooth as a prairie, and, moreover, is coated with an icy covering."  Jack glowed with enthusiasm over this project, and was about to indulge in one of his characteristic outbreaks, when there came an interruption which ended in a drama that put silver streaks among my coal-black locks! Some one came in where we were and called off the workmen, who went out with the others in great haste. Of course we followed at their heels. On reaching the principal cavern, we found a singular scene. Two natives, whom we had never seen before, were evidently in charge of some kind of a ceremony. They wore tall, conical hats made of polished metal and covered with hieroglyphics, and carried staves of iron in their hands.  "Priests," Edmund immediately whispered. "Now we'll see something interesting."  The "priests" marshaled all the others, numbering several hundreds, into a long column, and then began a slow, solemn march up the steps. The leaders produced a squeaking music by blowing into the ends of their staves. Women were mingled with men, and even the children were there, too. We followed at the tail of the procession, our curiosity at the highest pitch. At the rate we went it must have taken nearly an hour to mount the steps, but at last all emerged in the open air, where the cold struck to our marrow. The natives didn't seem to mind it, but we ran back and donned our furs. Then we re-ascended and stepped out into the Arctic night, finding the crowd assembled not far from the entrance to the cavern. The frosty sky was ablaze with stars, and directly overhead shone a planet of amazing size and splendor with a little one beside it.  "The earth and the moon!" exclaimed Edmund.  I cannot describe the flood of feeling that went over me at that sight! But in a moment Edmund interrupted my meditation by saying, in a quick, nervous way:  "_Look at that!_"  The natives had formed themselves in a circle with the two priests standing alone in the center. All but these two had dropped on their knees, while the leaders, elevating their long arms toward the zenith, gazed upward, uttering a kind of chant in their queer, squeaking voices.  "Don't you see what they're about?" demanded Edmund, twitching me irritably by the sleeve. "They're worshipping the earth!"  It was the truth--the amazing truth! They were worshipping our planet in the sky! And, indeed, she looked worth worshipping. Never have I seen so splendid a star. She was twenty times as bright as the most brilliant planet that any terrestrial astronomer ever beheld; and the moon, glowing beside her like an attendant, redoubled the beauty of the sight.  "It's just the moment of the conjunction," said Edmund. "This is their religion; the earth is their goddess, and when she is nearest and brightest they perform this ceremony in her honor. I wouldn't have missed this for a world."  Suddenly the two priests began to pirouette, and as they whirled more and more rapidly, their huge glowing eyes made phosphorescent circles in the gloom like those that had so alarmed and fascinated us in the cavern. They gyrated round the ring of worshipers with accelerated speed, and all those poor creatures fell under the fascination and drooped with heads to the ground. Now for the first time I caught sight of an oblong object rising a couple of feet above the ground in the center of the circle. I was wondering what it might be when the spinning priests, who had gradually drawn closer to the ring of worshipers, dived into the circle, and, catching each a native in his arms, ran with their captives to the curious object that I have just described.  "It's a sacrificial stone!" exclaimed Edmund. "They're going to kill them as an offering to the earth and her child the moon."  I was frozen with horror at the sight, but just as the second priest reached the altar, where the first victim had already been pinned with the sharp point of the sacrificial staff, his captive, suddenly recovering his senses, and terrified by the awful fate confronting him, uttered a cry, wrenched himself loose, and, running like the wind, leaped over the circle and disappeared in the darkness. The fugitive passed close by us, and Jack shouted as he darted past:  "Good boy!"  The enraged priest was after him like lightning, and as he came near us his awful eyes seemed to emit actual flames. But the runner had vanished. Without an instant's hesitation the priest shot out his great arm and caught _me_ by the throat! In another second I felt myself carried in a bound, as if a tiger had seized me, over the drooping heads of the worshipers and toward the horrible altar.    CHAPTER V   OFF FOR THE SUN LANDS  Dreadful as the moment was, I did not lose my senses. On the contrary, my mind was fearfully clear and active. There was not a horror that I missed. The strength and agility of my captor were astounding. I could no more have struggled with him than with a lion. Only one thing flashed upon me to do; I yelled with all the strength of my lungs. But they had become accustomed to our voices now, and the maddened creature was so intent upon his fell purpose that a cannon-shot would not have diverted him from it.  He got me to the altar, where the preceding victim already lay with his heart torn out, and, pressing me against it with all his bestial force, raised the pointed staff to transfix me. With dying eyes I saw the earth gleaming, magnificent, directly over my head, and my heart bounded with unreasoning hope at the sight. It was my mother planet, powerful to save!  All this passed in a second, while the dreadful spear was poised for its work. Even in that fraction of time I noticed the bunching muscles of the murderer's hairy arm, and then I pressed my eyes shut.  _Bang!_  Something touched me, and I felt the warm blood gushing. Then I knew no more.         *       *       *       *       *  In the midst of a dream of boyhood scenes a murmur of familiar voices awoke me. I opened my eyes, but as I could not make out where I was, closed them again.  Then I heard Edmund saying:  "He's coming out all right."  Thereupon, I reopened my eyes, but still the scene puzzled me. I saw Edmund's face, and behind those of Jack and Henry, wearing anxious looks. But this was not my room! It seemed to be a cave, with faint firelight reflections on the walls.  "Where am I?" I asked.  "Back in the cavern, and coming along all right," said Edmund.  Back in the cavern! What did he mean? Then, suddenly, memory returned.  "So he didn't sacrifice me!" I cried.  "Not on your life!" Jack's hearty voice responded. "Edmund was too quick for that."  "But only by a fraction of a second!" said Edmund, smiling.  "What happened, then?" I asked, my recollections coming back stronger and stronger.  "A mighty good shot happened," said Jack. "The best I ever saw."  I looked inquiringly at Edmund. He saw that I could bear it, and he began:  "When that fellow snatched you up and leaped inside the circle I had my furs wrapped so closely around me, not anticipating any danger, that for quite ten seconds I was unable to get out my pistol. I tore the garment open just in time, for already he was pressing you against the accursed altar with his spear poised. I didn't waste any time finding my aim, but even as it was the iron point had touched you when the bullet crashed through his brain. The shock swerved the weapon a little and you were only wounded in the shoulder. You got a scratch which might have been serious but for your Arctic coat. The fellow fell dead beside you, and under the circumstances I felt compelled to shoot the other one also, for he was insane with the delirium of their bloody rite, and I knew that our lives would never be safe if he remained ready for mischief.  "I'm sorry to have had to begin killing right and left again, but I guess that's the lot of all invaders, wherever they may go. It's the second lesson for these savages, and I believe it will prove final. When their priests were dead and the others had no fight in them, even if they had intended any harm to us.  Nobody knows to what those chaps might have led them, and my conscience is easy this time."  "How long have I been here?" I asked.  "Two days by the calendar clock?" replied Jack.  "Yes, two days," Edmund assented. "I never saw a man so knocked out by a shock, for the wound wasn't much; I fixed that up in five minutes. But I don't blame you. In your place I should have been scared to the bottom of my soul also. But look at yourself."  He held a pocket mirror before me, and then I saw that my hair was streaked with gray!  "But we haven't been idle in the meanwhile," Edmund went on. "I've got two sleds nearly completed, and to-morrow at midnight--earth time--I mean to set out for the sunny lands of Venus."  "How in the world could you have worked so fast?" I asked in surprise.  "Because I had certain tools in the car which vastly facilitated the operation; but I must admit that the savage blacksmiths worked well, too, and showed surprising intelligence in comprehending my directions. Perhaps that was because I had learned their language."  "Learned their language!" I exclaimed, staring in amazement.  "Well, perhaps that's putting it a little too strong; but I have learned enough to establish a pretty good understanding with them. There's nothing like working together to make intelligent creatures comprehend one another."  "But what kind of a language is it, then?" I asked.  "A language to make your hair stand on end," put in Jack. "The language that ghosts speak, I reckon! Not that I understand the least little bit of it, but I judge from what Edmund says."  With increasing bewilderment I looked at our leader. He smiled, and then looked thoughtful for a moment before again speaking. At last he said:  "It's a subject that I may be better able to discuss after I have learned more about it. All I can say at present is that it appears to be a kind of telepathy. You know that their voices seem hardly more cultivated, or capable of regular articulation, than those of mere brutes; and, besides, they have a certain horror of sound. These smiths wear coverings over their ears to minify the noise of their hammering. Yet they are able to converse, partly by physical signs, but more, I am sure, by some means which they possess of transferring thought without the mediation of any senses familiar to us. Sometimes I imagine that their extraordinary eyes play a large part in the phenomenon. But, however that may be, they certainly are able to read some of my thoughts, when we are in close relations and working together. One of them is especially gifted in this way, and what do you think? I have discovered his name!"  "Now, Edmund--" I began incredulously.  "Yes," he persisted, "it's a fact. You are to remember that they do interchange some of their ideas by means of sounds, and they have certain words, among which I am disposed to think are their individual designations. One of these words particularly attracted my attention because I observed that it was always addressed to the person I have just spoken of, and I finally concluded that it was his name. As near as I can imitate it, it sounds something like 'Juba.' So that's what I call him, and he's going to be the chief of the party that I propose to take with us. His services may be invaluable to us."  A great deal more was said on this curious subject, but since we did not arrive at a complete understanding of it until after we had reached the other side of the planet, I shall postpone any further explanation to the chapters which will be devoted to our astonishing adventures on that part of Venus.  My wound, as Edmund had said, was very slight, and the effects of the shock having passed off during the period of my unconsciousness, I was soon busy with the others in making the final preparations for our departure. The sleds were, of course, very rude affairs, but they were also very strong. Among the innumerable stores which Edmund's foresight had led him to put into the car were a number of exceedingly strong but light metallic cables. With these the two sleds were hitched, one behind the other, and a line about a hundred feet long connected them with the car. The latter could thus rise to a considerable height without lifting the sleds from the ground.  The sleds were provisioned from the stores of the natives, and we also took some of their food in the car, not only to eke out our own but because we had come to like it.  Edmund had already chosen the fellows who were to accompany us, and among them were two of the smiths besides Juba. In all they were eight. How he succeeded in persuading them I do not know, but not the slightest objection was apparent on their part, or on the part of their compatriots in the caverns. We were all ready at the predetermined time, and the scene at our departure was a strange one.  At least five hundred natives had assembled in a furry crowd around the entrance to the caverns to see us off. When we started, the fellows on the sleds, being unused to the motion, clung together like so many awkward white bears taking a ride in the circus. Their friends stood about the ill-omened sacrificial altar, waving their long arms, while their huge eyes goggled in the starlight.  Jack, in a burst of enthusiasm, fired four or five parting shots from his pistol. As the reports crashed through the heavy air, you should have seen the crowd vanish down the hole! The sight made me wince, for they must have gone down like a cataract, all heaped together. But they were tough, and I trust no heads were broken. The effect on the eight fellows on the sleds came near being disastrous. I expected to see them leap off and run, which no doubt they would have done if Edmund had not taken, for other reasons, the precaution to tie them fast. But they strained at their bonds, and squealed in terror.  "Give me your pistol!" commanded Edmund, in a voice of thunder, and with blazing eyes.  Jack was almost twice his size, but he handed over the pistol with the air of a rebuked schoolboy.  "When you learn how to use it, I'll give it back to you," said Edmund sternly, and that closed the incident.  Then we began gradually to put on speed, and as the ground was icy smooth and entirely unobstructed, we were soon traveling at the rate of sixty miles an hour. The plan of the sleds worked like magic, and after their first terror had passed away it was plain to be seen that the natives enjoyed the new sensation immensely. And, indeed, it was a glorious spin!  But in a little while a danger developed which we had not thought of. It arose from the existence of other caverns whose mouths opened upon the plain. To have precipitated the sleds into these would have been fatal. Luckily, shafts of light issued from all of them, and warned by these, we managed to avoid the danger. But it was not entirely passed before we had traveled at least a hundred miles. It was like an immense city of prairie dogs without mounds. The cavern that we had discovered on our arrival was evidently situated on the outskirts of the group, and now we were passing through the center of it. Occasionally we saw a huge white form disappear in one of the holes as we swiftly approached, but that was all we beheld of the inhabitants. But the spectacle of the shafts of light rising all around us was amazing. When we were in the midst of it Edmund hesitated for a moment, muttering that we had been too hasty and should have remained longer to study the peculiarities of this wonderful world of night; but finally he decided to keep on, and soon afterwards we saw the last of the caverns. Then, as there appeared to be no obstructions of any kind, the speed was worked up to a hundred miles an hour. Going straight ahead as we did, there was no danger of the sleds being overturned.  Having, as Edmund had calculated, about five thousand miles to go before reaching the edge of the sun-illuminated hemisphere, it was evident that, at our present rate of progress, we should arrive there in a little over two days by the calendar clock. We guided our course by the stars, and for me one of the most interesting things was to see the earth sinking toward the horizon, accompanied by the stars, as if the heavens were revolving in a direction opposed to our line of travel. We smoked and talked and ate and slept in the old way, while the marvelous mouths in the wall resumed their strange deglutition. Thus the time passed, without ennui, until, unexpectedly, a new phenomenon captured our attention.  Ahead, through the peephole, Edmund had descried again the flaming spires which had so astonished us on our approach to Venus. But now their appearance was splendid and imposing beyond words. Above them rose an arc of pearly light which grew higher every hour. And with the arc of light rose the flames also. At the same time they seemed to spread to the right and the left, until they were simultaneously visible from both of the side windows of the car. Their colors were wonderful--red, green, purple, orange--all the hues of the prism.  "There is the old mystery again," exclaimed Edmund, "and I can no more explain it now than I could when we first saw it on nearing the planet. The arc of light above is natural enough; it's simply the dawn. The sun never rises on this side of Venus, but it will rise for us because we are approaching it, and the light is the first indication that we are getting near enough to the border between day and night for some of the sun's rays to be bent over the horizon by refraction. But those flames! See how steady they are as a whole, and yet how they change color like a slowly turning prism."  "Don't, for God's sake, run us into a conflagration," said Jack. "I'm ready to believe anything of this topsy-turvy old planet, and I shouldn't be surprised if the other side is all fire as this one is all frost.  I can stand these hairy beasts, but I'll be hanged if I want to be introduced among salamanders."  "That's not real fire," said Edmund. "When we get a little nearer we can see what it is. In the meantime I'll try to think it out."  The result of Edmund's meditations, when he announced it to us, an hour later, awoke as much amazement in our minds as anything that had yet occurred. He had been sitting silent in his corner, occasionally taking a glimpse through the peephole, or one of the windows, when suddenly he slapped his thigh, and springing to his feet, exclaimed:  "They're mountains of crystal!"  "Mountains of crystal!" we echoed.  "Nothing else in the world, and I am ashamed not to have foreseen the thing. It's plain enough when you come to think about it. Remember that Venus being a world lying half in the daylight and half in the night, is necessarily as hot on one side as it is cold on the other. All of the clouds and floating vapors are on the day side, where the sunbeams act. The heated air charged with moisture rises over the sunward hemisphere, and flows off above, on all sides, toward the night side, while from the latter cold air flows in beneath to take its place. Along the junction of the two hemispheres the clouds and moisture are condensed by the intense cold, and fall in ceaseless snowstorms. This snow descending for ages has piled up in mountainous masses whose height may be increased in some places by real mountain ranges buried beneath. The atmospheric moisture cannot pass very far into the night hemisphere without being condensed, and so it is all arrested within a ring, or band, extending completely around the planet, and marking the division between perpetual day and perpetual night. The appearance of gigantic flames is produced by the sunbeams striking these mountains of ice and snow from behind and breaking into prismatic fire."  We listened to this explanation, so simple and yet so wonderful, with mingled feelings of astonishment and admiration. And then we turned again to regard the phenomenon, which now, with our nearer approach, had become splendid and awful beyond description.  In a few minutes Edmund addressed us again. "I foresee now," he said, "considerable trouble for us. There has been a warning of that, too, if I had but heeded it. I've noticed for some time that a wind, getting gradually stronger, has been following us, sometimes dying out and then coming on again stronger than before. It is likely that this wind gets to be a perfect hurricane in the neighborhood of those strange mountains. It is the back suction, caused, as I have already told you, by the rising of the heated air on the sunny side of the planet. It may play the deuce with us when we get into the midst of it. I shall have to be cautious."  He immediately reduced the speed to not more than ten miles an hour, and at once we noticed the wind of which he had spoken. It came now in great gusts from behind, rapidly increasing in frequency and fury. Soon it was strong enough to drive the sleds without any pull upon the cable, and sometimes they were forced directly under the car, and even ahead of it, the natives clinging to one another in the utmost terror. Edmund managed to govern the motions of the car for a time, holding it back against the storm, but as he confessed, this was a contingency he had made no provision for, and eventually we became almost as helpless as a ship in a typhoon.  "Of course I could cut loose from the sleds and run right out of this," said Edmund, "but that would never do. I've taken them into my service and I'm bound to look out for them. If there was room for them in the car it would be all right. Let's see. Yes! I've got it. I'll fetch up the sleds and fasten them underneath the car, like baskets to a balloon, and so carry the whole thing. There's plenty of power; it's only room that's wanting."  No sooner said than done with Edmund. By this time we were getting into the ice, huge hills of which surrounded us. Edmund dropped the car in the lee of one of these strange hummocks. Here the force of the wind was broken, and the sky directly over us was free from clouds, but a short distance ahead we could see them whirling and tumbling in mighty masses of tumultuous vapor. Lashing the two sleds together we attached them about ten feet below the bottom of the car. Then the natives, who had been unbound, and had stood looking on in utter bewilderment, were securely fastened on the sleds. We entered the car and the power was turned on.  "We'll rise straight up," said Edmund, "and as soon as we are out of the wind current we will sail over the mountains and come down on the other side as nice as you please. Strange that I didn't think of carrying the sleds in this way to begin with."  It was a beautiful program that Edmund had outlined, and we had complete confidence in our leader's ability to carry it through; but it didn't work as expected. Even his genius had met its match this time.  No sooner had we risen out of the protection of the hill of ice than the hurricane caught us. It was a blast of such power and ferocity that in an instant it had the car spinning like a teetotum, and then it shot us ahead, banging the sleds against the car as if they had been tassels. It is a wonder of wonders that the poor creatures on them were not flung off, but fortunately we had taken particular pains with their lashings, and as for knocks, they could stand them like so many bears.  In the course of twenty minutes we must have traveled twice as many miles, perfectly helpless to arrest our mad rush because, Edmund said, the atomic reaction partly refused to work, and he could not rise as he had expected to do. We were pitched hither and thither, and were sprawling on the floor more than half the time. The noise was awful, and nobody tried to speak after Edmund had shouted his single communication about the power, which would have filled us with dismay if we had had leisure to think.  The shutters were open, and suddenly I saw through one of the windows a sight which I thought must surely be my last. The car had been sweeping through a dense cloud of boiling vapors, and these had without warning split open before my eyes--and there, almost in contact with the car, was a glittering precipice of solid ice, gleaming with wicked blue flashes, and we were rushing upon it as if shot out of a cannon!  The next instant came a terrific shock, which I thought must have crushed the car like an eggshell, and down we fell--down and down!    CHAPTER VI   LOST IN THE CRYSTAL MOUNTAINS  If we had seen the danger earlier, and had not been so tumbled about by the pitching of the car, it is possible that Edmund would have prevented the collision, in spite of the partial disablement of his apparatus. The blow against the precipice of ice was not as severe as it had seemed to me, and the car was not smashed; but the fall was terrible! There was only one thing which saved us from destruction. At the base of the mighty cliff against which the wind had hurled the car an immense deposit of snow had collected, and into this we plunged. We were all thrown together in a heap, the car and the sleds being entangled with the wire ropes.  Fortunately the stout glass windows were not broken, and after we had struggled to our feet Edmund managed to open the door. Before emerging he bade us put on our furs, but even with them we found the cold outside all but unendurable. Yet the natives paid no attention to it. Not one of them was seriously hurt, although they were firmly attached to the sleds, and unable to undo their fastenings. We set them loose, and then began seriously to examine the situation.  Above us towered the vertical precipice disappearing in the whirling clouds, and the wind drove square against it with the roar of Niagara. The air was filled with snow and ice dust, and at intervals we could not see objects three feet away from our noses. Our poor furry companions huddled together, and being of no use to themselves or us, suffered more from the noise, and from the terror inspired by the snow than from any injuries that they had received.  "We've got to get out of this mighty quick," shouted Edward. "Hustle now and repair ship."  We got to work at once, Juba aiding us a little under Edmund's direction, and soon we had the sleds out of the tangle and properly attached. Then we replaced the natives on their seats, and entered the car. Edmund began to fumble with his apparatus. After some ten minutes' work he said, in an evasive way, that the damage was not serious enough to prevent the working of the car, but I thought I caught an expression of extreme anxiety in his face. Still, his manner indicated that he considered himself master of the situation.  "You notice," he said, "that this wind is variable, and there lies our chance. When the blasts weaken, the air springs back from the face of the cliff and then whirls round to the right. I've no doubt that there is a passage in that direction through which the wind finds its way behind this icy mountain, and if we can get there, too, we shall undoubtedly find at least partial shelter. I'm going to take advantage of the first lull."  It worked out just as he had predicted. As the wind surged back after a particularly vicious rush against the great blue cliff, we cut loose and went sailing up into it, rushing past the glittering wall so swiftly that it made our heads swim. In two or three minutes we rounded a corner, and then found ourselves in a kind of atmospheric eddy, where the car simply spun round and round, with the sleds whirling below it.  "Now for it!" shouted Edmund. "Hang on!"  He touched a knob, and instantly we rose with immense speed. We must have shot up a couple of thousand feet, when the wind, coming over the top of the icy barrier we had just flanked, caught us again, and swept us off on a horizontal course. Then, suddenly, the air cleared all round about, as if a magic broom had swept away the clouds. The spectacle that was revealed--but why try to describe it! No language could do it. Yet I must tell you what we saw.  We were in the heart of the _Crystal Mountains!_ They towered round us on every side, and stretched away in interminable ranges of shining pinnacles. Such shapes! Such colors! Such flashing and blazing of gigantic rainbows and prisms! There were mountains that looked to my amazed eyes as lofty as Mont Blanc, and as massive, every solid mile of which was composed of crystalline ice, refracting and reflecting the sunbeams with iridescent splendor. For now we could begin to see a part of the orb of the sun itself, prodigious in size, and poised on the edge of the gem-glittering horizon, where the jeweled summits split its beams into a thousand haloes.  There was one mighty peak, still ahead of us, but toward which we were rushed sidewise by the wind, which surpassed all the others in marvelousness. It towered majestically above our level--a superb, stupendous, coruscating _Alp of Light_! On every side it darted blinding rays of a hundred splendid hues, as if a worldful of emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds had been heaped together in one gigantic pile and transfused with a sunburst. Even Edmund was for a moment speechless with astonishment at this wildly magnificent sight. But presently he spoke, very calmly, though what he said changed our amazement to terror.  "The trouble with the apparatus is very serious. I am unable to make the car rise higher. It will no longer react against an obstacle. We are entirely at the mercy of the wind. If it carries us against that glittering devil no power under heaven can save us."  If my hair had not whitened before it surely would have whitened now!  [Illustration: "We were in the heart of the _Crystal Mountains_!"]  When we were swept against the first icy precipice the danger had come unexpectedly, out of a concealing cloud, and anticipation was swallowed up in the event. But now we had to bear the fearful strain of expectation, with the paralyzing knowledge that nothing that we could do could aid us in the least. I thought that even Edmund's face paled with fear.  On we rushed, still borne sidewise, so that the spectacle was burned into our eyes, as, with the fascination of impending death, we gazed helpless out of the window. Now we were upon it! Instinctively I threw myself backward; but the blow did not come. Instead there was a wild rush of ice crystals sweeping the thick glass.  "Look!" shouted Edmund. "We are safe! See how the particles of ice are swept from the face of the peak by the tempest. They leap toward us, and are then whirled round the mountain. The compacted air forms a buffer. We may yet touch the precipice, but the wind, having free vent on both sides, will carry us one way or the other without a serious shock."  He had hardly finished speaking, in a voice that had risen to a shriek with the effort to make himself heard, when the crisis came. We did just touch a projecting ridge, but the wind, howling past it, carried us in an instant round the obstruction.  "Scared ourselves for nothing," said Edmund, in a quieter voice, as the roar died down. "We were really as safe all the time as a boat in a deep rapid. The velocity of the current sheered us off."  Our hearts beat more steadily again, but there was a greater danger, of which he had warned us, but which we had not had time to contemplate. I, at least, began to think of it with dismay when the scintillant peak was left behind, and I saw Edmund again working away at his machinery. Presently it was manifest that we were rapidly sinking.  "What's the matter?" I cried. "We seem to be going down."  "So we are," he replied quietly, "and I fear that we shall not go up again very soon. The power is failing all the time. It will be pretty hard to have to stop indefinitely in this frightful place, but I am afraid that that is our destiny."  Lost and helpless in these mountains of ice and this world of gloom and storm! The thought was too terrible to be entertained. Yet it was forced into our minds even more by our leader's manner than by his words. Not one of us failed to comprehend its meaning, and it was characteristic that, while talkative Jack now said not a word, uncommunicative Henry burst into a brief fury of denunciation. I was startled by the energy of his words:  "Edmund Stonewall," he cried, agitating his arms, "you have brought me to my death with your infernal invention! May you be--"  But he never finished the sentence. His face turned as white as a sheet, and he sank in a heap upon the floor.  "Poor fellow," said Edmund, pityingly. "Would to God that he instead of Church had remained at home. But I'll get him and all of us out of this trouble; only give me a little time."  In a few minutes Jack and I had restored Henry to his senses, but he was as weak as a child, and remained lying on one of the cushioned benches. In the meantime the car descended until at last it rested upon the snow in a deep valley, where we were protected from the wind. In this profound depression a kind of twilight prevailed, for the sun, which we had glimpsed when we were on the level of the peaks, was at least thirty degrees below our present horizon. Henry having recovered his nerve, we all got out of the car, unloosed the natives, and began to look about us.  The scene was more disheartening than ever. All about towered the crystal mountains, their bases leaden-hued and formless in the ghostly gloom, while their middle parts showed deep gleams of ultramarine, brightening to purple higher up, and a few aspiring peaks behind us sparkled brilliantly where the sunlight touched them. It was such a spectacle as the imagination could not have conceived, and I have often tried in vain to reproduce it satisfactorily in my own mind.  Was there ever such a situation as ours? Cast away in a place wild and wonderful beyond description, millions of miles from all human aid and sympathy, millions of miles from the world that had given us birth! I could, in bitterness of spirit, have laughed at the suggestion that there was any hope for us. And yet, at that very moment, not only was there hope, but there was even the certainty of deliverance. But, unknown to us, it lay in the brain of the incomparable man who had brought us hither.  I have told you that it was twilight in the valley where we lay. But when, as frequently happened, tempests of snow burst over the mountains, and choked the air about us, the twilight turned to deepest night, and we had to illumine the lamps in the car. By great good fortune, Edmund said, enough power remained to furnish us with light and heat, and now I looked upon those mysterious black-tusked muzzles in the car with a new sentiment, praying that they would not turn to mouths of death.  The natives, being used to darkness, needed no artificial illumination. In fact, we had observed that whenever the sunlight had streamed over them their great eyes were almost blinded, and they suffered cruelly from an affliction so completely outside of all their experience. Edmund now began to speak to us of this, saying that he ought to have foreseen and provided against it.  "I shall try to find some means of affording protection to their eyes when we arrive in the sunlit hemisphere," he said. "It must be my first duty."  We heard these words with a thrill of hope.  "Then you think that we shall escape?" I asked.  "Of course we shall escape," he replied cheerfully. "I give you my word for it, but do not ask me for any particulars yet. The exact means I have not yet found, but find them I will. We may have to stay where we are for a considerable time, and our companions must be made comfortable. Even under their furry skins they'll suffer from this kind of weather."  Following his directions we took a lot of extra furs from the car, and constructed a kind of tent, under which the natives could huddle on the sleds. There being but little wind in the valley, this was not so difficult an undertaking as it may seem. And the poor fellows were very glad of the shelter, for some of them were shivering, since, not knowing what to do, they were less active than ourselves. No sooner were they housed than they fell to eating ravenously. Both the car and the sleds had been abundantly provisioned, so that there was no immediate fear of a famine among us.  Inside the car we soon had things organized very much as they were during our voyage from the earth. We read, talked, and smoked to our hearts' content, almost forgetting the icy mountains that tottered over us, and the howling tempest which, with hardly an intermission, tore through the cloud-choked air a thousand or two thousand feet above our heads. We talked of our adventure with the meteors, which seemed an event of long ago, and then we talked of home--home twenty-six million miles away! In fact, it may have been thirty millions by this time, for Edmund had told us that Venus, having passed conjunction while we were at the caverns, was now receding from the earth.  But while we thus strove to kill the time and banish thoughts of our actual situation, Edmund sat apart much of the time absorbed in thought, and we respected his privacy, knowing that our only chance of escape lay in him. One day (I speak always of "days," because we religiously counted the passage of time by our clock) he issued alone from the car and was absent a long time, so that we began to be concerned, and, going outside looked everywhere for signs of him. At length, to our infinite relief, he appeared stumbling and crawling along the foot of an icy mountain. As he drew nearer we saw that he was smiling, and as soon as he was within easy earshot he called out:  "It's all right. I've found the solution."  Then upon joining us he continued:  "We'll get out all right, but we shall have to be patient for a while longer."  "What is it?" we asked eagerly. "What have you found out?"  "Peter," he said, turning to me, "you know what libration means; well, it's libration that is going to save us. As Venus travels round the sun she turns just once on her axis in making a complete circuit, the consequence being, as you already know, that she has one side on which the sun never rises while the other half is in perpetual daylight. But, since her orbit is not a perfect circle, she travels a little faster than the average during about half of her year and a little slower during the other half, but, at the same time, her steady rotation on her axis never varies. This produces the phenomenon that is called libration, the result of which is that, along the border between the day and night hemispheres there is a narrow strip where the sun rises and sets once in each of her years, which are about two hundred and twenty-five of our days in length. Within this strip the sun shines continuously for about sixteen weeks, gradually rising during eight weeks and sinking during the following eight. Then, during the next sixteen weeks, the strip lies in unceasing night.  "Now the kind fates have willed that we should fall just within this lucky strip. By the utmost good fortune after we passed the blazing peak which so nearly wrecked us, we were carried on by the wind so far, before the ascensional power of the car gave out, that we descended on the sunward side of the crest of the range. The sun is now just beginning to rise on the part of the strip where we are, and it will get higher for several weeks to come. The result will be that a great melting of ice and snow will occur here, and in this deep valley a river will form, flowing off toward the sunward hemisphere, exactly where we want to go. I shall take advantage of the torrent that will flow here and float down with it until we are out of the labyrinth. It's our only chance, for we couldn't possibly clamber over the hummocky ice and drag the car with us."  "Why not leave the car here?" asked Henry.  Edmund looked at him and smiled.  "Do you want to stay on Venus all your life?" he asked. "I thought you didn't like it well enough for that. How could we ever get back to the earth without the car? I can repair the mechanism as soon as I can find certain substances, which I am sure exist on this planet as well as on the earth. But it is no use looking for them in this icy wilderness. No, we can never abandon the car. We must take it with us, and the only possible way to transport it is with the aid of the coming river."  "But how will you manage to float?" I asked.  "The car, being air-tight, will float like a buoy."  "But the natives, will you abandon them?"  "God forbid. I'll contrive a way for them."  The effects of libration on Venus were not new to me, but they were to Jack and Henry, who had never studied such things, and they expressed much doubt about Edmund's plan, but I had confidence in it from the beginning, and it turned out just as he had predicted, as things always did. Every twenty-four hours we saw, with thankful hearts, that the sun had perceptibly risen, and as it rose, the sky gradually cleared, while the sunbeams, falling uninterruptedly, grew hotter and hotter. Soon we no longer had any use for furs, or for artificial heat. At the same time the melting of the ice began. It formed, in fact, a new danger, by bringing down avalanches into the valley, yet we watched the process joyously, since it fell so entirely within Edmund's program. While we were awaiting the flood, Edmund had prepared screens to protect the eyes of the natives.  We were just at the bottom of the trough of the valley, near its head. It wound away before us, turning out of sight beyond an icy bulwark. Streams were soon pouring down from the heights all around, and uniting, they formed a little torrent, which flowed swiftly over the smooth, hard ice. Edmund now completed his plan.  "I'll take Juba in the car with us," he said. "There's just room for him. As for the others, we'll fasten the sleds on each side of the car, which will be buoyant enough to float them, and they'll have to take their chances outside."  We made the final arrangements while the little torrent was swelling to a river. Before it became too broad and deep we managed to place the car across the center of its course, the sleds forming outriders. Then all took their places and waited. Higher and higher rose the waters, while avalanches, continually increasing in size and number, thundered down the heights, and vast cataracts leaped and poured from the precipices. It was a mercy that we were so situated that the avalanches could not reach the car. But we received some pretty hard knocks before the stream became deep and steady enough to float us off. Shall I ever forget that moment?  There came a sudden wave, forced onward by a great slide of ice, which lifted car and sleds on its crest, and away we went! The car proved more buoyant than I had believed possible. The sleds, fastened on each side, tended to give it extra stability, and it did not sink deeper than the middle of the windows. The latter, though formed of very thick glass, might have been broken by the tossing ice if they had not been divided into small panes separated by bars of steel, which projected a few inches outside.  "I made that arrangement for meteors," said Edmund, "but I never thought that they would have to be defended against ice."  The increasing force of the current sent us spinning down the valley with accelerated speed. We swept round the nearest ice peak on the left, and as we passed under its projecting buttresses a fearful roar above informed us that an avalanche of unexampled magnitude had been unchained. We could not withdraw our eyes from the window on that side of the car, and almost instantly immense masses of ice appeared crashing into the water, throwing it over us in floods and half drowning the unfortunate wretches on the sleds. Still, they clung on, fastened together, and we could do nothing to aid them. The uproar grew worse, and the ice came plunging down faster and faster, accompanied with a deluge of water from the heights above. The car pitched and rolled until we were all flung off our feet. Poor Juba was a picture of abject terror. He hung moaning to a bench, his huge eyes aglow with fright.  Suddenly the car seemed to be lifted clear from the water, and then it fell back again and was submerged, so that we were buried in night. Slowly we rose to the surface, and Edmund, springing to a window, shouted:  "They're gone! Heaven have pity on them--and on me!"  In spite of their fastenings the water had swept every living soul from the sled on the left. We rushed to the other window. It was the same story there--the sled on that side was also empty. I saw a furry body tossed in the torrent alongside, but in a second it disappeared beneath the raging water. At the same time Edmund exclaimed:  "God forgive us for bringing those poor creatures here only to meet their death!"    CHAPTER VII   THE CHILDREN OF THE SUN  But the situation was too critical to permit us to think of the unfortunates whose death we had undoubtedly caused. There seemed less than an even chance of our getting through with our own lives. As we tossed and whirled onward the water rose yet higher, and blocks of ice assailed us on all sides. First the sled on the left was torn loose; then the other followed it, leaving the car to fight its battle alone. But the loss of the sleds was a good thing now that their occupants were gone, for it eased off the weight and the car rose much higher in the water. Moreover, it gave way more readily when pressed by the ice. To be sure, it rolled more than before, but still, being well ballasted, it did not turn turtle, and most of the time we were able to keep on our feet by holding fast to the inside window bars.  Once we took a terrible plunge, over a vertical fall of not less than twenty or thirty feet. But the water below the fall was very deep, a profound hole having been quickly scooped out in the unfathomable ice beneath, so that we did not strike bottom, as I had feared, but came bobbing to the top again like a cork. Below this fall there was a very long series of rapids, extending, it seemed, for miles upon miles, and we shot down them with the speed of an express train, lurching from side to side, and colliding with hundreds of ice floes. It must not be supposed that we went through this experience without suffering any injuries. On the contrary, our hands were all bleeding, our faces cut, Henry had one eye closed by a blow, and our clothing, for we were not wearing our Arctic outfit, was badly used up. Yet none of our injuries was really serious, although we looked as if we had just come out of the toughest kind of a street brawl.  But there is no use in prolonging the story of this awful ride. It seemed to us to last for days upon days, though, in fact, the worst of it was over within twelve hours after we were lifted from our moorings in the valley. The tumbling stream gradually broadened out as it left the region of the high mountains, and then we found ourselves in a district covered with icy hills of no great elevation. But we could still see, by glances, as the stream curved this way and that, the glittering peaks behind. It was an appalling thing to watch many of the nearer hills as they suddenly sank, collapsed, and disappeared, like pinnacles of loaf sugar melting and falling to pieces in a basin of water.  Edmund said that all of the ice-hills and mounds through which we were passing no doubt owed their existence to pressure from behind, in the belt where the sun never rose, and where the ice was piled up in actual mountains. These foothills were, in fact, enormous glaciers thrust out toward the sunward hemisphere.  After a long time the now broad river widened yet more until it became a great lake, or bay. The surface of the planet around appeared nearly level, and, as far as we could see, was mostly covered by the water. Here vast fields of ice floated, and the water was not muddy, as it would have been if it had passed over soil, but of crystal purity and wonderfully blue in places where shafts of sunlight penetrated to great depths--for now the sun was high above the horizon ahead, and shining in an almost clear sky. Presently we began to notice the wind again. It came fitfully, first from one quarter and then another, rapidly increasing until, at times, it rose into a tempest. It lifted the water in huge combing waves, but the car rode them like a lifeboat.  "There is peril for us in this," said Edmund, at last. "We are being carried by the current into a region where the contending winds may play havoc. It is the place where the hot air from the sunward side begins to be chilled and to descend, meeting the colder air from the night side. It must form a veritable belt of storms, which may be as difficult to pass, circumstanced as we are, as the crystal mountains themselves."  "Suppose it should turn out that there is nothing but an ocean on this side of the planet," I suggested.  "That I believe to be impossible," Edmund responded. "This hemisphere must be, as a whole, broken up into highlands and depressions. The geological formation of the other side, as far as I could make it out from the appearance of the rocks in the caverns, indicates that Venus has undergone the same experience of upheavals and fracturings of the crust that the earth has been through. If that is true of one side it must be true of the other also, for during a large part of these geological changes she undoubtedly rotated rapidly on her axis like the earth."  "But we traveled five thousand miles on the other side without encountering anything but a frozen prairie," I objected.  "True enough, and yet I would lay a wager that all of that side of the planet is not equally level. Remember the vast plains of Russia and Siberia."  "Well," put in Jack, whose spirits were beginning to revive, "if there's a shore somewheres, let's find it. I want to see the other kind of inhabitants. These that we've met don't accord with my ideas of Venus."  "We shall find them," responded Edmund, "and I think I can promise you that they will not disappoint your expectations."  Yet there seemed to be nothing in our present situation to warrant the confidence expressed by our leader's words and manner. The current that had carried us out of the crystal mountains gradually disappeared in a vast waste of waters, and we were driven hither and thither by the tempestuous wind. Its force increased hour by hour, and at last the sky, which at brief intervals had been clear and exquisitely blue, became choked with black clouds, sweeping down upon the face of the waters, and often whirled into great _trombes_ by the tornadic blasts. Several times the car was deluged by waterspouts, and once it was actually lifted up into the air by the mighty suction. An ordinary vessel would not have lived five minutes in that hell of winds and waters. But the car, if it had been built for this kind of navigation, could not have behaved better.  I do not know how long all this lasted. It grew worse and worse. Sometimes a flood of rain fell, and then would come a storm of lightning, and a downpour of gigantic hailstones that rattled upon the steel shell of the car like a rain of bullets from a battery of machine guns. Half the time one window or the other was submerged by the waves, and when we got an opportunity to glance out, we saw nothing but torn streamers of cloud whipping the face of the waters. But when the change came at last, it was as sudden as the dropping of a curtain. The clouds broke away, a soft light filled the atmosphere, the waves ceased to break and rolled in long undulations, and a marvelous dome appeared overhead.  That dome, at its first dramatic appearance, was one of the most astonishing things that we saw in the whole course of our adventures. It was not a cerulean vault like that which covers the earth in halcyon weather, but an indescribably soft, pinkish-gray concavity that seemed nearer than the sky and yet farther than the clouds. Here and there, far beneath it, but still at a vast elevation, floated delicate gauzy curtains, tinted like sheets of mother-of-pearl. The sun was no longer visible, but the air was filled with a delicious luminousness, which bathed the eyes as if it had been an ethereal liquid.  Below each window was a steel ledge, broad enough to stand on, with convenient hold-fasts for the hands. These had evidently been prepared for some such contingency, and Edmund, throwing open the windows, invited us to go outside. We gladly accepted the invitation, and all, except Juba, issued into the open air. The temperature was that of an early spring day, and the air was splendidly fresh and stimulating. The rolling of the car had now nearly ceased, and we had no difficulty in maintaining our positions. For a long while we admired, and talked of, the great dome overhead, which drew our attention, for the time, from the sea that had so strangely brought us hither.  "There," said Edmund, pointing to the dome, "is the inside of the shell of cloud whose exterior, gleaming in the sunshine, baffles our astronomers in their efforts to see the surface of Venus. I believe that we shall find the whole of this hemisphere covered by it. It is a shield for the inhabitants against the fervors of an unsetting sun. Its presence prevents their real world from being seen from outside."  "Well," said Jack, laughing, "I never heard before that Venus was fond of a veil."  "Not only can they not be seen," continued Edmund, "but they cannot themselves see beyond the screen that covers them."  "Worse and worse!" exclaimed Jack. "The astronomers have certainly made a mistake in naming this bashful planet Venus."  We continued for a long time to gaze at the great dome, admiring the magnificent play of iridescent colors over its vast surface, until suddenly Jack, who had gone to the other side of the car, called out to us:  "Come here and tell me what this is."  We hurried to his side and were astonished to see a number of glittering objects which appeared to be floating in the atmosphere. They were arranged in an almost straight row, at an elevation of perhaps two thousand feet, and were apparently about three miles away. After a few moments of silence, Edmund said, in his quiet way:  "Those are air ships."  "Air ships!"  "Yes, surely. An exploring expedition, I shouldn't wonder. I anticipated something of that kind. You know already how dense the atmosphere of Venus is. It follows that balloons, and all sorts of machines for aerial navigation, can float much more easily here than over the earth. I was prepared to find the inhabitants of Venus skilled in such things, and I'm not surprised by what we see."  "Venus with wings!" cried Jack. "Now, Edmund, that sounds more like it. I guess we've struck the right planet after all."  "But," I said, "you spoke of an exploring expedition. How in the world do you make that out?"  "It seems perfectly natural to me," replied Edmund. "Remember the two sides of the planet, so wonderfully different from one another. If we on the earth are so curious about the poles of our planet, simply because they are unlike other parts of the world, don't you think that the inhabitants of Venus should be at least equally curious concerning a whole hemisphere of their world, which differs _in toto_ from the half on which they live?"  "That does seem reasonable," I assented.  "Of course it's reasonable, and I imagine that we, ourselves, are about to be submitted to investigation."  "By Jo!" exclaimed Jack, running his hands through his hair, and smoothing his torn and rumpled garments, "then we must make ready for inspection. But I'm afraid we won't do much honor to old New York. Can I get a shave aboard your craft, Edmund?"  "Oh, yes," Edmund replied, laughing. "I didn't forget soap and razors."  But Jack would have had no time to make his toilet even if he had seriously thought of it. The strange objects in the air approached with great rapidity, and we soon saw that Edmund had correctly divined their nature. They were certainly air ships, and I was greatly interested in the observation that they seemed to be constructed somewhat upon the principles upon which our inventors were then working on the earth. But they were neither aeroplanes nor balloons. They bore a resemblance to mechanical birds, and seemed to be sustained and forced ahead by a wing-like action.  This, of course, did not escape Edmund's notice.  "Look," he said admiringly, "how easily and gracefully they fly. Perhaps with our relatively light atmosphere we shall never be able to do that on the earth; but no matter," he added, with a flush, "for with the inter-atomic energy at our command, we shall have no need to imitate the birds."  "Perhaps they have made that discovery here, too," I suggested.  "No, it is evident that they have not, else they would not be employing mechanical means of flight. Once let me get the car fixed up and we'll give them a surprise."  "Yes, and if you had used common sense," growled Henry, nursing his injured eye, "you would not be here fooling away your time and ours, and risking our lives every minute, but you'd be making millions and revolutionizing life at home."  "And where'd the Columbus of Space be then?" demanded Jack. "Hanged if Edmund is not right! I'd rather be here meeting these doves of Venus than grinding out dollars on the earth. And can't we go back and scoop in the money when we get ready?"  The discussion went no further, for, by this time, two of the air ships were close at hand. And now we perceived, for the first time, the beings that they carried. Our surprise at the sight was even greater than that which we had experienced upon meeting the inhabitants of the dark hemisphere. The latter were extraordinary--but we were looking for extraordinary things. Indeed they were, except for certain peculiarities, much more like some members of our own race than we should have deemed possible. How great, then, was our astonishment upon seeing the two air ships apparently in charge of _real human beings_!  At least that was our first impression. In the midst of the strange apparatus, which evidently fulfilled the function of wings for the air ships, we saw decks, spacious enough to contain twenty persons, and surmounted with deck houses, and along the railings inclosing the decks were gathered the crews, among whom we believed that we could recognize their officers. The two vessels had approached within a hundred yards before being suddenly arrested. Then they settled gracefully down upon the water, where they floated like swans.  At first, as I have said, the resemblance of their crews to inhabitants of the earth seemed complete. One would have said that we had met a yachting party, composed of tall, well-formed, light-complexioned, yellow-haired Englishmen, the pick of their race. At a distance their dress alone appeared strange, though it, too, might easily be imitated on the earth. As well as I can describe it, it bore some resemblance, in general effect, to the draperies of a Greek statue, and it was specially remarkable for the harmonious blending of soft hues in its texture.  During a space of at least five minutes we gazed at them, and they at us. Probably their surprise was greater than ours, because we had been on the lookout for strange sights, being, of our own volition, in a foreign world, while they could have had no expectation of such an encounter, even if, as Edmund had conjectured, they were engaged in exploration. We could read their astonishment in their gesticulations. Slowly the car and the nearer of the two air ships drifted closer together. When we were within less than fifty yards of one another, Jack suddenly called out:  "A woman! By Jo, it's Venus herself!"  His excited voice rang like a rattle of musketry in the heavy air, and the beings on the air ship started back in alarm. But although, like the inhabitants of the dark hemisphere, they were, evidently, unaccustomed to hearing sounds of such forcefulness issue from a living creature no larger than themselves, they were not faint-hearted, and the air ship did not, as we half expected it would, take flight. The momentary commotion was quickly quieted, and our visitors continued their inspection. All of us immediately recognized the personage whom Jack had singled out as the subject of his startling exclamation. It was clear that he had rightly guessed her sex, and she appeared worthy of his admiring designation. Even at the distance of a hundred feet we could see that she was very beautiful. Her complexion was light, with a flame upon the cheeks; her hair a chestnut blond; and her large, round eyes were sapphire blue, and seemed to radiate a light of their own. This last statement (about the eyes) must not be taken for a conventional exaggeration, such as writers of fiction employ in describing heroines who never existed. On the contrary, it expresses a literal fact; and moreover, as the reader will see further on, this peculiarity of the eyes was shared, in varying degrees, by all these people of Venus, and was connected with the most amazing of all our discoveries on that planet. I should say here that, while the eyes of the inhabitants of the day side were larger than ours, they did not, in respect of size, resemble the extraordinary organs of vision possessed by the compatriots of Juba.  In a few minutes we became aware that the beautiful creature we had been admiring was not the only representative of the female sex on the air ship. Several others surrounded her, and the fact quickly became manifest that they recognized her as a superior. Still more surprising was the discovery, which we were not long in making, that she was actually the commander of the craft. We could see that the orders which determined its movements emanated from her.  "Amazons!" exclaimed Jack, taking pains this time to moderate his voice. "And what a queen they've got!"  During all this time the car and the air ship were slowly drifting nearer to one another, drawn by that strange attraction which seems to affect inanimate things when in close neighborhood, and when they were not more than fifteen yards apart the personage we had been watching slowly lifted her arm, revealing a glittering bracelet, and, with an ineffably winning smile, made a gesture which said plainer than any words could have done:  "Welcome, strangers."    CHAPTER VIII   LANGUAGE WITHOUT SPEECH  "That breaks the ice," said the irrepressible Jack. "We're introduced! Now for the conquest of Venus."  We had all instinctively returned the smile of our beautiful interlocutor, with bows and gestures of amity, and it looked as though we might soon be within touch of her hand, for the vessels continued to drift nearer, when suddenly Juba clambered out of the window and stood beside us, his moon eyes blinking in the unaccustomed light. The greatest agitation was immediately manifest among the crowd on the deck of the air ship. They seemed to be even more startled than they had been by the sound of Jack's voice. They interchanged looks, and, apparently, a few words, spoken in very low voices, and glanced from Juba to us in a way which plainly showed that they were astonished at our being together.  Edmund, whose perspicacity never deserted him, immediately penetrated their thoughts.  "It is clear," he said, "that these people recognize Juba as an inhabitant of the dark hemisphere, while, as to us, they are puzzled, and all the more so now that Juba has made his appearance. I think it certain that they have never actually met any representative of Juba's race before, but no doubt he bears, to their eyes, ethnological characteristics which escape our discernment, and it is likely that tradition has handed down to them facts about the inhabitants of the other side of their planet which accord with his appearance."  "Then, they must conclude that we have come from the other side, and brought Juba along as a captive," I said.  "Undoubtedly."  "And what must they think of us--that we are inhabitants of the dark hemisphere also?"  "What else can they think?"  I do not know into what train of speculation this might have led us if a new incident had not suddenly changed the current of our thoughts. Unnoticed by us the second air ship had drawn near. Signals were interchanged between it and the first, and we observed that she who seemed to be the commander in chief gave orders that the second air ship should lay us aboard. The order was no sooner given than executed, and we found ourselves face to face with a dozen of the blond-haired natives, led by one who was clearly their captain. The deck of the air ship touched the side of the car, and, as if instinctively recognizing our leader, the captain laid his hand on Edmund's arm, but with a smile which gave assurance that no violence was intended.  "Come," said Edmund, in a low voice, "it is best that we should go aboard their craft. We are in their hands, and luckily so, for they will take us where we want to go."  Accordingly, all, including Juba, passed upon the deck of the air ship. You will readily imagine the intensity of interest with which we studied the faces and forms of those whom I will call our captors. Now that we were in contact with them we could better observe their resemblances to, and differences from, ourselves. In all the main features of body they were human beings, but of a somewhat superior stature. Noses and mouths were small and delicate; hair long, silken, and either light gold or rich chestnut in color; skin white and smooth; ears small and peculiarly formed, with a curious mobility; and eyes large, round, invariably light blue, and possessing that strange luminousness of which I have already spoken. One could not look directly into these eyes without a certain shrinking, for some wonderful power seemed to radiate from them, and one had the feeling that the intelligence behind them could dip to the bottom of his mind. We were gently treated and could perceive no indication of peril to ourselves. Nevertheless, we were glad to feel our pistols in our pockets. There were seats on the deck to which we were civilly conducted, but Edmund refused to sit.  "I must see the commander herself," he whispered. "These are only subordinates, and I cannot deal with them. It will not do to leave the car here at the mercy of the waves. I must find the means of making them understand that it is to go with us."  Accordingly, he approached the captain, and we watched him with beating hearts, not being able to divine what an attempt to dictate terms on our part might lead to. Jack shook his head, and put his hand on his pistol, which Edmund had restored to him while we were in the ice mountains.  "I'll drop the jackanapes in his tracks if he shows up ugly," he said.  "You'd better keep quiet," I whispered, "and don't let them see your weapon. They appear to have no arms, and you should trust to Edmund to manage the affair. When he gives the word it will be time enough to begin shooting."  Jack grumbled, but kept the pistol in his pocket, although he did not withdraw his hand from it.  I have already told you how, at the caverns, Edmund had discovered that the inhabitants there possessed a means of converse which he likened to telepathy, and from what I had seen of the people here I was convinced that they had the same mysterious power, and probably in a higher degree. To be sure, they used words occasionally, but for the most part they communed together in some other way. I felt sure that Edmund was now about to apply what he had learned, and his actions quickly demonstrated that my conjecture was well founded. Just what he did, I do not know, but the result of his conference was promptly apparent.  The first air ship had withdrawn a short distance when the other boarded the car, but now the two mutually approached until it was possible to step from one deck to the other. As soon as they touched, Edmund was conducted by the captain, at whose side he had remained standing, to the presence of the important personage whom Jack had begun to designate as the queen. We remained where we were, watching with all eyes, while Jack persisted in keeping his hand on the pistol in his pocket. A crowd immediately surrounded Edmund and we were unable to see exactly what went on, a fact that rendered Jack so much the more impatient. But it turned out that there was no cause for alarm. In about ten minutes the crowd opened and Edmund appeared. Uninterfered with, he came to the edge of the deck, close by us, and said:  "It is all arranged. The car will be towed by one of the air ships. I am to stay here and you will remain where you are until we reach our destination."  "Have you had a talk with her?" asked Jack.  "Not in any language that you understand," Edmund responded, smiling. "But I have made good use of what I learned in the caverns. These people are intellectually vastly superior to the others, and, as I guessed, they possess a more perfect command of the sort of telepathy that I told you about. I have not found much difficulty in making my wish understood, and your amazon is a very obliging person. It is only necessary to be discreet and we shall have no trouble."  "But why are you to be separated from us?" asked Jack anxiously. "That looks bad, for it is exactly what they would do if they meant to kill us one at a time."  "Why should they kill us?" retorted Edmund.  "And why should we be separated?" persisted Jack. "I tell you, Edmund, I don't like it."  "Very well, then," Edmund said, after a moment's thought; "if that's the way you feel about it, I'll see what I can do. It will be another exercise for me in this new kind of language. But, mark this, if I succeed in persuading the chieftainess to keep us together, you will have to acknowledge that your fears were groundless. Perhaps it's worth trying on that very account."  He disappeared from our eyes again--for as soon as he approached their leader the people of the air ship crowded close around as if to afford her protection--and, after another ten minutes' conference, came back smiling to the edge of the deck.  "Dismiss your fears, friend Jack," he said cheerfully. "You are all to come aboard here with me. So you see there could have been no thought of treachery; but I'm glad that we are not to be separated, and I thank you for your solicitude on my account.  I'm sure that the original arrangement was made only because of lack of room aboard this craft, and you'll see that that was the reason."  He was right, for immediately half a dozen of the crew of the principal air ship were sent aboard ours while we were transferred to take their place.  We now had an opportunity to study the countenance of the "amazon" commander, and we found her to be an even more remarkable personage than she had appeared at a distance. Of the beauty of her features and form I shall say no more, but about her eyes I could write a chapter. The pupils, widely expanded amidst their circles of sky-blue iris, seemed to speak. I can describe the impression that they made in no other way. I no longer wondered at Edmund's ability to converse with her, for I felt that, with a little instruction, and more of our leader's mental penetration, I could do it myself. At times I shrank from encountering her gaze, for I verily believed that she read my inmost thoughts. And I could see that _thought came out of her eyes_, but it escaped all my efforts to grasp it; it was too evanescent, or I was too dull. Sometimes I imagined that the meaning was at the threshold of comprehension, but yet it evaded me, like forgotten words whose general sense dimly irradiates the mind, while they refuse to take a definite shape, and keep flitting just beyond the reach of memory. Still, charity and good will shone out so plainly that anybody could read them, and I do not know how to express the feeling that came over me at this evidence of friendliness exhibited by an inhabitant of a world so far from our own. It was as if a dim sense of ultimate fraternity bound her to us. Jack's enthusiasm, as you may guess, was without bounds, and strangely enough it rendered him almost speechless.  "By Jo!" he kept repeating to himself in an undertone, without venturing upon any further expression of his feelings.  Henry, as usual, was silent, but I know that he felt the influence no less than the rest of us. Edmund, too, said nothing, but it was plain that he was continually studying the phenomenon, and I felt sure that his analytic mind would find a more complete explanation than we yet possessed. Of course you are not to suppose that the power that I have been trying to describe was peculiar to this woman. On the contrary, as I have already intimated, it was common to all of them; but with her it seemed to have reached a higher development, and, what was of special interest, she alone exhibited a marked benevolence toward us.  The car was attached by a cable to the air ship that we had just quitted, and our voyage into a new unknown began. The other air ships, which had been hovering about, moved up into line, and, with the exception of the one which towed the car, all rose to an elevation of perhaps a thousand feet, and moved rapidly away from a row of dark clouds which we could now see low on the horizon behind. We found the air ship splendidly fitted up, with everything that could contribute to the comfort of its inmates. And what a voyage it was! "Yachting on Venus," as Jack called it. We sat on the deck, with a pleasant breeze, produced by the swift, steady motion, fanning our faces; the temperature was delightful; the air was wonderfully stimulating; the light, softly and evenly diffused from the great shell-like dome of the sky, seemed to bewitch the eyesight; and the sea beneath us, reflecting the dome, was a marvel of refluent colors.  We had left the calendar clock in the car, but, with our watches, which we had never ceased to wind up regularly, we were able to measure the time. The voyage lasted about seventy-two hours, but could, perhaps, have been performed in less time if we had not been somewhat delayed by the towing of the car. They had on the air ship ingenious clocks, driven by weights, and governed by pendulums, but the divisions of time were unlike ours, and there was nothing corresponding to our days. This, of course, arose from the fact that there was never any night, and, being unable to see either sun or stars, they had no measure of the year. With them time was simply endless duration, with no return in cycles.  "What interests me most," said Edmund, "is the fact that they should have established any chronological measure at all. It would puzzle some of our metaphysicians on the earth to account for the origin of their sense of time. To me it seems evident that the consciousness of duration is fundamental in all intelligent life, and does not necessarily demand natural recurrences, like the succession of day and night, and the passage of sun and stars across the meridian, to give it birth. Did you ever read St. Augustine's reply to the question, 'What is time'--'I know if you don't ask me'?"  "If they haven't any years," said Jack, "how do they know when they are old enough to die?"  "They have the years, but no measure for them," replied Edmund, and then added quizzically, "Perhaps they _don't_ die."  "Well, I shouldn't wonder," Jack returned, "for this seems to me to be Paradise for sure."  When we felt sleepy, we imitated the natives themselves, and, just as we had done during the voyage from the earth, created an artificial night by shutting ourselves up in the cabins that had been assigned to us. Rest was taken by all of them in this manner as regularly as it is taken at night on the earth.  One subject which we frequently discussed during the voyage was the astonishing resemblance of our hosts to the _genus homo_. Influenced by speculations which I had read at home about the probable unlikeness to one another of the inhabitants of different planets, I was particularly insistent upon this point, and declared that the facts as we found them were utterly inexplicable.  "Not at all," Edmund averred. "It is perfectly natural, and quite as I expected. Venus resembles the earth in composition, in form, in physical constitution, and in subordination to the sun, the great ruler of the entire system. Here are the same chemical elements, and the same laws of matter. The human type is manifestly the highest possible that could be developed with such materials to work upon. Why, then, should you be surprised to find that it prevails here as well as upon our planet? Intelligent life could find no more suitable abode than in a human body. The details are simply varied in accordance with the environment--a principle that works on the earth also."  I was not altogether satisfied with the reasoning--but as to the facts, we had to believe our eyes.  Palatable food was served to us, and during the waking time Edmund was frequently engaged in his mysterious conversation with the "queen." Within forty-eight hours after we had set out in the air ship, he came to us, wearing one of his enigmatic smiles, and said:  "I've got another aphroditic word for you to remember. It is the name of our hostess--Ala."  We were not so much surprised by this news as we should have been but for what had occurred at the caverns, where he had discovered the patronymic of Juba.  "Good!" cried Jack, "it's a fine name. I was going to call her Aphrodite, myself, but this is better as well as shorter."  "But, Edmund," I said, "how does it happen that these people, if they converse by 'telepathy' as you say, and as I fully believe, nevertheless occasionally use sounds and words? I should think it would be all one thing or all the other."  "Think a moment," he replied. "Is it so with us? Do we not use signs and gestures as well as words? And what do we mean by 'silent converse,' when mind speaks to mind and soul to soul without the intervention of spoken language? We have the potentiality of telepathic intercommunication, but we have not yet developed it into a kinetic form as these people have done. Ah, when will men begin to appreciate _what mind means?_"  I made no reply, and after a moment's musing, he continued:  "I suspect that here, too, speech preceded the higher form of converse, and that the spoken language remains only as a survival, presenting certain advantages for particular cases. But we shall learn more as time goes on."  There was no disputing Edmund's conclusions. He was the greatest accepter and defender of facts as he found them that I have ever known.  It was written that before this voyage ended we should have another phase of language without speech presented for our wonderment. It came about near the end of the trip. We were standing apart in a group, greatly interested and excited by the discovery, which had just been made, of land ahead. Far in advance we could see a curving, yellow shore line, and, dim in the distance behind it, a range of mountains. Edmund had just called our attention to these, with the remark that now I must admit that he had reasoned correctly about the existence of elevated regions on this side of Venus, when Jack, always the first to note a new phenomenon, exclaimed:  "Hurrah! Here they come! We're going to have a royal reception."  He pointed toward the land in a different direction from that in which we had been gazing, and immediately we beheld an extraordinary assemblage of air ships, perhaps ten miles off, but rapidly making toward us. More were coming up from behind, as if rising out of the land, and soon they resembled flocks of large birds all converging to a common center. In a little while they became almost innumerable, but their number soon ceased to be as great a cause of surprise to us as their peculiar appearance. Viewed with our binoculars they showed an infinite variety of shapes and sizes. Chinese kites could not, for a moment, be compared in grotesqueness with the forms which many of them presented. Some soared in vast circles at a great height, with the steady flight of eagles; others spread out to right and left, as if to flank us on either hand; and in the center, directly ahead, about a hundred advanced in column deployed in a semicircle, each keeping its place with the precision of a soldier in line of battle.  As we continued to gaze, fascinated by the splendor and strangeness of the spectacle, suddenly the air was filled with fluttering colors. I do not mean flags and streamers, but _colors in the air itself_! Colors the most exquisite that ever the eye looked upon! They changed, flickered, melted, brightened, flowed over one another in iridescent waves, mingled, separated, turned the whole atmosphere into a spectral kaleidoscope. And it was evident that, in some inexplicable way, the approaching squadrons were the sources of this marvelous display. Presently from the craft that carried us, answering colors flashed out, as if the air around us had suddenly been changed to crystal with a thousand quivering rainbows shot through it, their beautiful arches shifting and interchanging so rapidly that the eye could not follow them.  Then I began to notice that all this incessant play of colors was based upon an unmistakable rhythm. I can think of no better way to describe it than to say that it was as if a great organ should send forth from its keys harmonic vibrations consisting not of concordant sounds but of even more perfectly related undulations of color. The permutations and combinations of this truly chromatic scale were marvelous and magical in their infinite variety. It thrilled us with awe and wonder. But none was so rapt as Edmund himself. He gazed as if his soul were in his eyes, and finally he turned to us, with a strange look, and said, almost under his breath:  "This, too, is language, and more than that--it is music!"  "Impossible!" I exclaimed.  "No, not impossible, since it _is_. They are not only exchanging intelligence in this way, but we are being greeted with a great anthem played in the heaven itself!"  There was the force of enthusiastic conviction in Edmund's words, and we could only look at him, and at one another, in silent astonishment.  "Oh, what a people! What a people!" he muttered. "And yet I am not surprised. I dimly fore-read this in Ala's eyes."  Even Jack's levity was subdued for the time, but after a while he said to me with a shrug, half in earnest, half in derision:  "Well, this Yankee-doodling in the air gets me! I'd prefer a little plain English and the Old Folks at Home."  After about ten minutes the display ceased as suddenly as it had begun, and the nearer of the approaching air craft began to circle around us. Finally one of them ran so close alongside that an officer of high rank, for such he seemed to be, leaped aboard us, and was quickly at Ala's side. There was a rapid interchange of communications between them, and then the newcomer was, I may say, presented. Ala led him to where we were standing, and I could read in his eyes the astonishment that the sight of such strangers produced in him.    CHAPTER IX   AN AMAZING METROPOLIS  If I should undertake to describe in detail all the events that now followed in rapid succession, this history would take a lifetime to write. I must choose only the more significant facts.  The newcomer, whose remarkable face had immediately impressed me, and not altogether favorably, proved to be a personage of very great importance, second only, as we could see, to Ala herself. And, what was particularly important for us, he showed none of her friendly disposition. I do not mean to suggest that he seemed inclined to any active hostility, but evidently we were, in his eyes, no better than savages, and consequently entitled to no special consideration, and especially to no favors. Jack, who, with all his careless ways, had a penetrating mind for the perception of character, whispered to me, within five minutes after the fellow came aboard:  "If that galoot had his way, we'd make our entry in irons. Mark my words, there's mischief in him. Hang him! I'm going to keep my pistol handy when he's around."  Edmund, who happened to overhear Jack's remark, interposed:  "See here, Master Jack, this is no time to be talking of pistols. I trust that we are done with shooting."  We were not done with it; but that comes later.  It was not long before Edmund had discovered a name for the newcomer also; he called him Ingra. It was singular, he said, that all the names seemed to be characterized by the prevalence of vowels sounds, but he thought it likely that this arose from the greater ease with which they could be enunciated. They were like Spanish words, which are the easiest of all for foreigners, and probably also for natives, to pronounce.  After we reached the coast we descended to the ground, at Edmund's request, I believe, because he wished to superintend the loading of the car upon one of the largest air ships, and it was an unforgettable sight to watch him managing the work as coolly and effectively as if he had been in charge of a gang of workmen at home! And, while I looked, I found myself again doubting if, after all, this was not a dream. The workers hurrying about, Edmund following them, pointing, objecting, urging and directing, with his derby hat, which had come through all our adventures (though somewhat damaged), stuck on the back of his head--and all this on the planet Venus! No! I could not be awake. But yet I was.  When we started again, we were escorted by a hundred air ships, forming a complete circle about us. Now I noticed, what had escaped attention during the extraordinary atmospheric display, viz., that these craft were painted in colors that I should call gorgeous if they had not been so perfectly harmonious and pleasing. Every one looked like the careful creation of an artist, and the variety of tints exhibited was incredible. Our own air ship, and its consorts, on the other hand, were very plain in their decorations. I called Edmund's attention to this and immediately he said:  "Remember what I told you--this has been an exploring expedition, and the craft taking part in it have been fitted up for rough work. That reminds me that I have not yet made the inquiries that I intended on that subject. I shall go to Ala now and see what I can learn."  She was standing on the deck near the other end, with Ingra beside her. As Edmund approached them, Jack nudged me:  "Look at that fellow," he said. "Wasn't I right?"  There was no doubt about it; Ingra scowled and showed every sign of displeasure at Edmund's presence. But Ala greeted him graciously, and, apparently, Ingra did not dare to interfere. I could see that Jack was grasping his pistol again, but I did not anticipate that there would be any occasion to use it. Nevertheless, I watched them closely for a time, hoping to discover Edmund's method of reading her meaning; as to her comprehension of his I had no question about that. But I got no light on the subject, and, as it soon became evident, even to Jack, that there was no danger this time, we fell to examining the land over which we were passing.  We flew at a height of about two thousand feet, so that the range of vision was very wide. The sea behind us curved into the land in three great scallops, separated by acuminate promontories, whose terminal bluffs of sand were as yellow as gold. Away ahead the line of mountains, that we had noticed before, appeared as a dark sierra, and between it and the sea the country seemed to be very little broken by hills. Large forests were visible, but from our elevation it was impossible to tell whether the trees composing them bore any resemblance to terrestrial forms. The open land was about equally divided in area between bare yellowish soil (or what we took to be soil) and bright green expanses whose color suggested vegetation. Scattered here and there we saw what appeared to be habitations, but we could not be sure of their nature; and, upon the whole, the land seemed to us to be very thinly populated.  Many birds accompanied us in our flight, frequently alighting on the deck and other parts of the air ship. They were remarkably tame, allowing us to approach them closely, and we were delighted by their beautiful plumage and their singular forms. This reminds me to say that the motion of the craft was extremely curious--a kind of gentle rising and falling, which was very agreeable when once we were accustomed to it, and which resembled what one would suppose to be the movement of a bird in flight. This, of course, arose from the structure of the air ship, which, as I have before said, seemed to be modeled, as far as its motive parts were concerned, upon the principle of wings rather than of simple aeroplanes. But the mechanism was very complicated, and I never arrived at a full comprehension of it.  Edmund remained a long time in conference with Ala, Ingra staying constantly with them, and when he had apparently finished his "conversation" we were surprised to see them begin a tour of inspection of the air ship, finally descending into the interior. This greatly excited Jack, who was for following them at once.  "I can't be easy," he declared. "Nobody can tell what may happen to him if they get him alone."  But I succeeded in persuading him that there could be no danger, and that we ought to trust to Edmund's discretion. They were gone so long, however, that at last I became anxious myself, and was on the point of suggesting to Jack that we try to find them, when they reappeared, and Edmund at once came to us, his face irradiated with smiles.  "I have plenty of news for you," he said, as soon as he had joined us. "Never in my life have I spent two hours more delightfully. In the first place, I have found out practically all that I wished to know about this expedition, and, second, I have thoroughly examined the mechanism of the ship. Its complication is only apparent, and the management of it is so simple that a single man can pilot it easily. I could do it myself."  We did not appreciate at the time what the knowledge that Edmund had thus acquired meant for us.  "Well, what about the expedition?" asked Jack. "And where are we going?"  "From what I can make out," replied Edmund musingly, "Ala is really what you called her, Jack, a queen. But such a queen! If we had some like her on the earth, monarchy might not be such a bad thing after all. She is a _savant_."  "Bluestocking," put in Jack. "This is a new kind of amazon."  Edmund did not smile.  "I am in earnest," he continued. "Of course you understand that most of my conclusions are really based upon inference. I cannot grasp all that she tries to tell me, but her gestures are so speaking, and her eyes so full of a kind of meaning which seems to force its way into my mind, I cannot tell how, that I am virtually sure of the correctness of my interpretation. The expedition, which I am certain was planned by her, was intended to explore the outskirts of the dark hemisphere. Perhaps they meant to penetrate within it, but, if so, the stormy belt that we crossed was too serious an obstacle for them to overcome. Our encountering them was the greatest stroke of good fortune that we have yet had. It places us right at the center of affairs."  "Where are they going now?"  "Evidently back to their starting point; which is likely to be a great city--the capital and metropolis, most probably. The more I think of it the stronger becomes my conviction that Ala is really, at least in power and influence, a queen. And you can see for yourselves that it must be a great and rich empire that she rules, for remember the extraordinary reception with which she was greeted, the innumerable air ships, the splendor of everything."  "But are we to be well treated? Is there no danger for us in accompanying them?"  "If there were danger, it would be hard for us to escape from it now; but why should there be danger? We did not kill the Esquimaux that our polar explorers brought from the Arctic regions, and for these people, we are a greater curiosity than ever the Esquimaux, or the Pygmies of Africa, were for us. Instead of encountering any danger, I anticipate that we shall be very well treated."  "Perhaps they'll put us in a cage," said Jack, with a ludicrous grimace, "and tote us about as a great moral show for children. If there's a Barnum on Venus, our fate is sealed."  Jack's humorous suggestion struck home, for there seemed to be probability behind it, and Henry groaned, while, for my part, I confess that I felt rather uncomfortable over the prospect. But Edmund did not pursue the conversation, and soon we fell to regarding again the landscape beneath and far around us. We were gradually nearing the mountains, although they were still distant, and presently we caught sight of what resembled, as much as anything, gigantic cobwebs glittering with dew, and rising out of the plain between us and the mountains.  "There, Edmund," said Jack, "there's another chance to exercise your genius for explaining mysteries. What are those things?"  Edmund watched the objects for several minutes before replying. At length he said, with the decision characteristic of him:  "Palaces."  Jack burst out laughing.  "Castles in Spain, I reckon," he said. "But, really, Edmund, what do you think they can be?"  "I have already told you, palaces, or castles, if you prefer."  "You are serious?" I asked.  "Perfectly so. They cannot be anything else."  Seeing our astonishment and incredulity, Edmund added:  "Since they retain their places, it is evident that they are edifices of some kind, attached to the ground. But their great height and aerial structure indicate that they are erected in the air--floating, I should say, but firmly anchored at the bottom. Really, I cannot see anything astonishing about it; it accords with everything else that we have seen. Your minds are too hidebound to terrestrial analogies, and you do not give your imaginations sufficient play with the new materials that are here offered.  "This atmosphere," he continued, after a pause, "is exactly suited for such things. It is a region of atmospheric calm. If we were not moving, you would hardly feel a breeze, and I doubt if there is ever a high wind here. To build their habitations in the air and make them float like gossamers--could any idea be more beautiful than that, or more in harmony with the nature of this planet, which is the favorite of the sun, for first he inundates it with a splendor unknown to the earth, and then generously covers it with a gorgeous screen of cloud which cuts off his scorching beams but suffers the light to pass, filtered to opalescent ether?"  When Edmund spoke like that, as he sometimes did, suffusing his words with the fervor of his imagination, even Henry, I believe, felt his soul lifted to unaccustomed heights. We hung upon his lips, and, without a word, waited for him to continue. Presently he murmured, in an undertone:  "Yes, all this I foresaw in my dream. A world of crystal, houses that seemed not made with hands, reaching toward heaven, and a people, beautiful beyond compare, dwelling in the aerial home of birds"; and then, addressing us, in his ordinary tones: "You will see that the capital, which we are unquestionably approaching, is to a large extent composed of this airy architecture."  And it turned out to be as he had said--when, indeed, was it ever otherwise? As we drew nearer, the aerial structures which we had first seen began to tower up to an amazing height, just perceptibly swaying and undulating with the gentle currents of air that flowed through their traceried lattices, while behind them began to loom an immense number of floating towers, rising stage above stage, like the steel monsters of New York before they have received their outer coverings, but incomparably lighter in appearance, and more delicate and graceful; truly fairy constructions, bespangled with countless brilliant points. Yet nearer, and we could see cables attached to the higher structures, and running downward as if anchored to the ground beneath, but the ground itself we could not see, because now we had dropped lower in the air, and a long hill rose between us and the fairy towers, whose slight sinuous motion, affecting so many together, produced a trifling sense of dizziness as we gazed. Still nearer, and we believed that we could see people in the buoyant towers. A minute later there was no doubt about their presence, for the _colors_ broke forth, and that marvelous interchange of chromatic signals, which had so astonished us as we drew near the coast, was resumed.  "It is my belief," said Edmund, "that, notwithstanding the buoyancy of the heavy atmosphere, those structures cannot be maintained at such elevations without mechanical aid. You will see when we get nearer that every stage is furnished with some means of support, probably vertical screws reacting upon the air."  Again he had guessed right, for in a little while we were near enough to see the screws, working in a maze of motion, like the wings of a multitude of insects. The resemblance was increased by their gauzy structure, and, as they turned, they flashed and glittered as if enameled. (The supernatant structures that they maintained were, as we afterwards ascertained, framed of hollow beams and trusses--a kind of bamboo, of great strength and lightness.)  Now we rose over the intervening hill, and as we did so a cry burst from our lips. A vast city made its appearance as by magic, a magnified counterpart of the aerial city above it. Put all the glories of Constantinople, Damascus, Cairo, and Bombay, with all their spires, towers, minarets, and domes together, and multiply their splendor a thousand times, and yet your imagination will be unable to picture the scene of enchantment on which our eyes rested.  "It is the capital of Venus," exclaimed Edmund. "There can be nothing greater than this!"  It must, indeed, be the capital, for in the midst of it rose an edifice of unparalleled splendor, which could only be the palace of a mighty monarch. Above this magnificent building, which gleamed with metallic reflections, although it was as light and airy in construction as frostwork, rose the loftiest of the aerial towers, a hundred, two hundred--I cannot tell you how many stories in height, for I never succeeded in counting them.  The other air ships now dropped back, and ours alone approached this stupendous tower, making apparently for its principal landing stage. Along the sides of the tower a multitude of small air ships ran up and down, stopping at various stages to discharge their living cargoes.  "Elevators," said Edmund.  Glancing round we saw that similar scenes were occurring at all the towers. They were filling up with people, and the continual rising and descending of the little craft that bore them, the holiday aspect of the gay colors everywhere displayed, and the brilliancy of the whole spectacle moved us beyond words. But the most astonishing scene still awaited us.  Just before our vessel reached the landing stage, the enormous tower, from foot to apex, broke out with all the hues of the rainbow, like an enchanted rose tree covered with millions of brilliant flowers at the touch of a wand. The effect was overwhelming. The air became tremulous with rippling colors, whose vibrant waves, with quick succession of concordant tints afforded to the eye an exquisite pleasure akin to that which the ear receives from a carillon of bells. Our companions, and the people crowded on the towers, seemed to be transported with ecstatic delight.  "Again the music of the spectrum!" cried Edmund. "The diapason of color! It is their national hymn, or the hymn of their race, written on a prismatic, instead of a sonometric, staff. And, mark me, this has a significance beyond your conjectures!"  I believe that our enjoyment of this astonishing spectacle was hardly less than that of the natives themselves, but the pleasure was suddenly broken off by a tragedy that struck cold to our hearts.  We had nearly touched the landing, when we observed that a discussion was going on between Ala and Ingra, and it quickly became evident that we were the subject of it. Before we could exchange a word, they approached us, and Ingra, in a threatening manner, laid his hand on Edmund's shoulder. In a second Jack had his pistol covering Ingra. Edmund saw the motion, and struck Jack's arm aside, but the weapon exploded, and, clutching her breast, Ala fell at our feet!    CHAPTER X   IMPRISONMENT AND A WONDERFUL ESCAPE  The shock of this terrible accident, the full import of which must have flashed simultaneously through the mind of every one of us, drove the blood from Edmund's face, while Jack staggered, uttering a pitiful moan, Henry collapsed, and I stood trembling in every limb. The report of the pistol produced upon the natives the effect that was to have been expected. Ingra sprang backward with a cry like that of a startled beast, and many upon the deck fell prostrate, either through terror or the effect of collision with one another in their wild flight. What occurred among the waiting crowd on the tower I do not precisely know, but a wind of fear seemed to pass through the air--a weird, heart-quaking _shadow of sound_.  For a few moments, I believe, no one but ourselves understood what had happened to Ala. Ingra may have thought, if he thought at all in his terror and surprise, that she had fallen as the result of nervous shock. This moment of paralysis on the part of those whom we had now to regard as our enemies, whatever they may have been before, afforded the opportunity for escape--if there had been any way to escape. But we were completely trapped; there was no direction in which we could flee. Yet I doubt if the thought of flight occurred to any of us. Certainly it did not to Edmund, who was the first to recover his self-command.  "_We have shot down our only friend!_" he said with terrible emphasis, and, as he spoke, he lifted Ala in his arms and laid her on a seat. Her breast was stained with blood.  At the sight of this, a flash of comprehension passed over the features of Ingra; then, instantly, his face changed to a look of fury, and he sprang upon Edmund. With trembling hand, I tried to draw my pistol, but before I could get it from my pocket there was a rush, a hairy form darted past me, and Ingra lay sprawling on his back. Over him, with foot planted on his breast, stood the burly form of Juba, with his muscular arms uplifted, and his enormous eyes blazing fire!  God only knows what would have happened next, but at this instant Ala--to my amazement, for I had thought that the bullet had gone through her heart--rose to an upright posture, and made a commanding gesture, which arrested those who were now hurrying to take a part in the scene. All, natives as well as ourselves, stood as motionless as stone. Her face was pale and her eyes were wonderful to look upon. With a gasp of thankfulness, I noticed that the blood on her breast was but a narrow streak Juba, staring at her, slowly withdrew his foot from his prostrate opponent, and Ingra first sat up, and then got upon his feet. Ala, who had been seated, rose at the same moment, and looked Ingra straight in the face. I saw Edmund glancing from one to the other, and I knew he was trying to follow the communication that was taking place between them.  The general sense of it I could follow, myself. Ingra, metaphorically, stormed and Ala commanded. That she was defending us was plain, and it was but natural that my admiration for this wonderful woman should rise to the highest pitch. I thanked God, in my heart, that her wound could be no more than a scratch--and yet it was a wound, inflicted upon the person of her who, there could be no doubt, was the ruler of a powerful empire. It was less majesty, or worse, and she, herself, might not be able to protect us against its consequences.  At last, it became evident that a decision had been made. Ala turned to us with a smile, which we took for an assurance of encouragement, at least, and started to leave the deck. Edmund instantly stepped in front of her, and pointed to the stain of blood, with a gesture and a look which meant, at the same time, an inquiry as to the nature of the wound and an expression of the wish to do something to repair the injury. She shook her head and smiled again, in a manner which clearly said that the hurt was not serious and that she understood that it was an accident. Then, surrounded by her female attendants, she passed out of our sight in the crowd on the landing. Edmund turned to us:  "We shall probably get out of it all right," he said, "but not without some difficulty. They will surely imprison us. Make no resistance. Leave all to me. Jack's pistol will, no doubt, be seized, but if the rest of you keep yours concealed, they may not search for them, as they know nothing about the weapons."  Edmund had spoken hurriedly, and had hardly finished when a dozen stout fellows, under Ingra's directions, took us in charge, Juba included, and we were led from the deck, through the vast throng on the platform, who made room for our passage, while devouring us with curious, though frightened eyes. In a minute we embarked on one of the "elevators," and made a thrillingly rapid descent. Arrived at the bottom, we were conducted, through long, stone-walled passages, into a veritable dungeon. And there they left us. I wondered if this had been done at Ala's order, or in defiance of her wishes. After all, I reflected, what claim have we upon her?  In the absolute darkness where we now found ourselves, we remained silent for a minute or two, feeling about for one another, until the quiet voice of Edmund said:  "Fortune still favors us."  As he spoke, a light dazzled our eyes. He had turned on a pocket electric lamp. We looked about and found that we were in a square chamber, about fifteen feet on a side, with walls of heavy stone.  "They make things solid enough down here," said Jack, with some return of his usual spirits, "however airy and fairy they may be above."  "All the better for us," returned Edmund enigmatically.  Henry sank upon the floor, the picture of dejection and despair. I expected another outbreak from him, but he spoke not a word. His heart was too full for utterance, and I pitied him so much that I tried to reanimate his spirits.  "Come, now," I said, "don't take it this way, man. Have confidence in Edmund. He has never yet been beaten."  "I reckon he's got his hands full this time," put in Jack. "What do you think, Edmund, can your atomic energy bore a hole through these walls?"  "If I had it here, you'd see," Edmund replied. "But there's no occasion to worry, we'll come out all right."  It was his unfailing remark when in difficulties, and somehow it always enheartened us. Juba, more accustomed to such situations, seemed the least disturbed member of the party. He rolled his huge eyes around the apartment once or twice, and then lay down on the floor, and seemed at once to fall asleep.  "That's a good idea of Juba's," said Edmund, smiling; "it's a long time since we have had a nap. Let's all try a little sleep. I may dream of some way out of this."  It was a fact that we were all exhausted for want of sleep, and, in spite of our situation, I soon fell into deep slumber, as peaceful as if I had been in my bed at home. Edmund had turned out the lamp, and the silence and darkness were equally profound.  I dreamt that I was at the Olympus Club on the point of trumping an ace, when a flash of light in the eyes awoke me. I started up and found Edmund standing over me. The others were all on their feet. Edmund immediately whispered:  "Come quietly; I've found a way out."  "What have you found?"  "Something extremely simple. This is no prison cell, but a part of what appears to be the engine rooms--probably it is an unused storeroom. They have put us here for convenience, trusting more to the darkness than to the lock, for the corridors outside are as black as Erebus and as crooked as a labyrinth."  "How do you know?"  "Because, while you were all asleep, I made an exploration. The lock was nothing; the merest tyro could pick it. Fortunately they never guessed that I had a lamp. In this world of daylight, it is not likely that pocket lamps have ever been thought of. Just around the corner, there is another door opening into a passage that leads by a power house. That passage gives access to a sort of garage of air craft, and when I stole into it five minutes ago, there was not a soul in sight. We'll simply slip in there, and if I can't run away with one of those fliers, then I'm no engineer. To tell the truth, I'm not altogether sure that it is wise for us to escape, for I have a feeling that Ala will help us; still, when Providence throws one a rope, it's best, perhaps, to test its strength. Come on, now, and make no noise."  Accompanied by Juba, we stepped noiselessly outside, extinguishing the light, and, led by Edmund, passed what he had called the power house, where we saw several fellows absorbed in their work, lighted somehow from above. Then we slipped into the "garage." Here light entered from without, through a large opening at the side. There may have been twenty small air ships resting on cradles. Edmund selected one, which he appeared to have examined in advance, and motioning us to step upon its little deck, he began to manipulate the mechanism as confidently as if it had been his own invention.  "You see that I did not waste my time in examining the air ship that brought us," he whispered, and never before had I admired and trusted him as I did now. In less than a minute after we had stepped aboard, we were circling in the air outside. We rose with stunning rapidity, swooping away in a curve like an eagle.  At this instant we were seen!  There was a quick flashing of signals, and two air craft shot into sight above us.  "Now for a chase!" cried Edmund, actually laughing with exultation.  We darted upward, curving aside to avoid the pursuers. And then they swooped after us. We rose so rapidly that within a couple of seconds we were skirting the upper part of the great tower. Then others saw us, and joined in the chase. Jack's spirits soared with the excitement:  "Sorry to take rogue's leave of these Venuses," he exclaimed. "But no dungeons for us, if you please."  "We're not away, yet," said Edmund over his shoulder; and, indeed, we were not!  The air ships swarmed out on every side like hornets; the atmosphere seemed full of them. I gave up all hope of escape, but Edmund was like a racer who hears the thud of hoofs behind him. He put on more and more speed until we were compelled to hang on to anything within reach in order to save ourselves from being blown off by the wind which we made, or whirled overboard on sharp turns.  Crash! We had run straight into a huge craft that persisted in getting in our way. She dipped and rolled like a floating log. I saw the fellows on her tumble over one another, as we shot by, and I glanced anxiously to see if any had gone overboard. We could afford to do no killing if we could avoid it; for, in case of recapture, that would be another indictment against us. I saw no one falling from the discomfited air ship, and I felt reassured. Occupied as he was, dodging and turning, Edmund did not cease to address a few words to us occasionally.  "There's just one chance to beat them," he said, "and only one. I'm going to try it as soon as I can get out of this press."  I had no notion of what he meant, but a few minutes later I divined his intention. I had observed that all the while he was working higher and higher, and this, as you will presently see, was the key to his plan.  Up and up we shot, Edmund making the necessary circles as short as possible, and so recklessly did he turn on the speed that it really began to look as if we might get away after all. Two thirds of our pursuers were now far below our level, but none showed a disposition to give up the chase, and those which were yet above tried to cross our bow. While I saw that Edmund's idea was to hold a skyward course, I was far from guessing the particular reason he had for doing so, and, finally, Jack, who comprehended it still less, exclaimed:  "See here, Edmund, if you keep on going up instead of running off in one direction or another, they'll corner you in the middle of the sky. Don't you see how they have circled out on all sides so as to surround us? Then when we get as high as we can go, they'll simply close in, and we'll be trapped."  "Oh, no, we won't," Edmund replied.  "I don't see why."  "Because they can't go as high as we can."  "The deuce they can't! I guess they understand these ships as well as you do."  "Can a fish live out of water?" asked Edmund, laughing.  "What's that got to do with it?"  "Why, it's plain enough. These people are used to breathing an atmosphere surcharged with oxygen and twice as dense as that of the earth. It doesn't trouble our breathing, simply giving us more energy; but we can live where they would gasp for breath. Air impossibly rare for them is all right for us, and that's what I am in search of, and we shall find it if we can get high enough."  The beauty and simplicity of this unexpected plan struck us all with admiration, and Jack, his doubts instantly turning to enthusiasm, cried:  "By Jo, Edmund, you're a trump! I'd like to get a gaff into the gills of that catfish, Ingra, when he begins to blow. By Jo, I'd pickle him and make a present of him to the Museum of Natural History. '_Catfishia Venusensis_, presented by Jack Ashton, Esq.'--how'd that look on a label, hey?"  And Jack hugged himself with delight over his conceit.  In a short time the accuracy of Edmund's conjecture became apparent. Our pursuers, one by one, dropped off. Their own strategy, to which Jack had called attention, was simply a playing into our hands. They had really thought to catch us in the center of a contracting circle, when, to their amazement, we rose straight up into air so rare that they could not live in it. Edmund roared with laughter when he saw the assured success of his maneuver.  But there was one thing which even he had overlooked, and it struck to our hearts when we became aware of it. Poor, faithful Juba, who had so recently proved his devotion to us, could endure this rare air no better than our pursuers. Already, unnoticed in the excitement, he had fallen upon the deck, where he lay gasping.  "Good God, he's dying!" exclaimed Jack.  "He shall not die!" responded Edmund, setting his lips, and turning to his machinery.  "But, you're not going back down there!"  "I'll run beyond the edge of the circle, and drop down far enough to revive him. Then we can keep dodging up and down just out of their reach, and so be out of danger both ways."  No sooner said than done. We ran rapidly on a horizontal course until we had cleared the air ships below, and then dropped like a shot. Juba came to his senses in a few moments after we entered the denser air. But now our pursuers, thinking, no doubt, that we had found it impracticable to remain where they knew they could not go, began to close in upon us. I reflected that here was the only mistake that Edmund had made--I mean the bringing along with us of the natives of the dark hemisphere. It was only their presence that had prevented us from sailing triumphantly over the crystal mountains; it was because of them that we had wrecked the car; and now it was Juba who baffled our best chance of escape. And yet--and I am glad to be able to say it--I could not regret his presence, for had he not made himself one of us; had he not proved himself entitled to all the privileges of comradeship?  But Henry (I am sorry to write it) did not share these feelings.  "Edmund," he said, "why do you insist upon endangering our lives for the sake of this--this--animal here?"  Never have I beheld such a blaze of anger as that which burst from Edmund's eyes as he turned upon Henry:  "You cowardly brute!" he shouted. "I ought to throw you overboard!"  He seemed about to execute his threat, dropping the controller from his hand as he spoke, and Henry, with ashen face, ran from him like a madman. I caught him in my arms, fearing that he would tumble overboard in his fright, and Edmund, instantly recovering his composure, turned back to his work.  Finding Juba sufficiently recovered, although yet weak and almost helpless, he rose again, but more cautiously than before. And now our pursuers, plainly believing that these maneuvers could have but one ending, began to set their net, and I could not help admiring their plan, which would surely have succeeded if they had not made a fundamental error in their calculations, but one for which they were not to blame. There was such a multitude of their craft, fresh ones coming up all the while, that they were able to form themselves into the shape of a huge bag net, the edge of which was carried as high as they dared to go, while the sides and receding bottom were composed of air ships so numerous that they were packed almost as closely as meshes. Edmund laughed again as he looked down into this immense net.  "No, no," he shouted. "We're no gudgeons! You'll have to do better than that!"  "See here, Edmund," Jack suddenly exclaimed, "why don't you make off and leave them? By keeping just above their reach we could easily escape."  "_And leave the car?_" was the reply.  "By Jo," returned Jack, "I never thought of that. But, then, what did you run away for at all?"  "Because," said Edmund quietly, "I thought it better to parley than to lie in prison."  "Parley! How are you going to parley?"  "That remains to be seen; but I guess we'll manage it."  We were now, as far as I could estimate, five or six miles high. When we were highest, the great cloud dome seemed to be but a little way above our heads, and I thought, at first, that Edmund intended to run up into it and thus conceal our movements. The highest of our pursuers were about half a mile below us. They circled about, and were evidently parleying on their own account, for waves of color flowed all about them, making a spectacle so brilliant and beautiful that sometimes I almost forgot our critical situation in watching it.  "I suppose you'll play them a prismatic symphony," said Henry mockingly.  I looked at him in surprise. Evidently his fear of Edmund had vanished; no doubt because he knew in his heart the magnanimity of our great leader.  "Who knows?" Edmund replied. "I've no doubt the materials are aboard, and if I had been here a month, I'd probably try it. As things stand, we shall have to resort to other methods."  While we were talking, Edmund did not relax his vigilance, and two or three times, when he had dropped to a lesser elevation for Juba's sake, he baffled a dash of the enemy. At last we noticed a movement in the crowd which betokened something of importance, and in a moment we saw what it was. A splendid air ship, by far the most beautiful that we had yet seen, was swiftly approaching from below.  "It's the queen," said Edmund. "I thought she'd come."  The approaching ship made its way straight toward us, and, without the slightest hesitation, Edmund dropped down to meet it. Those who had been our pursuers now made no attempt to interfere with us; they recognized the presence of a superior authority. Soon we were so near that we could recognize Ala, who looked like Cleopatra in her barge on the charmed waves of Cydnus. Beside her, to the intense disappointment of Jack and myself, stood Ingra.  "Confound him!" growled Jack. "He's always got to have his oar in the puddle. Blamed if I'm not sorry Edmund spoiled my aim. I'd have had his scalp to hang up at the Olympus to be smoked at!"  Of what now occurred, I can give no detailed account, because it was all beyond my comprehension. We approached almost within touch, and then Edmund stood forth, fearless and splendid as Caesar, and conducted his "parley." When it was over, there was a flashing of aerial colors between Ala's ship and the others, and then all, including ours, set out to return to the capital. After a while Edmund, who had been very thoughtful, turned to us and said:  "You can make your minds easy. Of course you'll understand there is a certain amount of guesswork in what I tell you, but you can depend upon the correctness of my general conclusions. I believe that I have made it perfectly clear that we intended no harm, and that we are not dangerous characters. At least Ala understands it perfectly. As for Ingra, perhaps he doesn't want to understand it. I can't make out the cause of his enmity, but it is certain that he doesn't like us, and if it all depended upon him, it would go hard with us. I believe that we shall have to stand a trial of some kind, but remember that we've got a powerful advocate. I don't regret our running off, for, as I anticipated, it afforded us the opportunity to establish some sort of terms. The mere fact that we return willingly when they know that we might have fled beyond their reach should count in our favor, for, as I have always insisted, these are highly intelligent people, with civilized ideas. If I had not been sure of that I should have continued the flight and depended upon some other means of recovering the car--or constructing a new one."  We had become so much accustomed to accept Edmund's decisions as final that none of us thought of objecting to what he had done; unless it might have been Henry, but he kept his thoughts to himself.     CHAPTER XI   BEFORE THE THRONE OF VENUS  While we were dropping down toward the city, with a great fleet of air ships attending, Edmund opened his mind upon another curious difficulty besetting us.  "You, of course, noted," he said, "how close we approached at one time to the cloud dome. The existence of that sky screen is a circumstance which may possibly be decisive in the determination of our fate."  "Favorable or unfavorable?" I asked.  "Unfavorable, for this reason. If these people could be made to understand that we are visitors from another world, and not inhabitants of the other side of their own planet, they might treat us with greater consideration, and even with a certain superstitious deference. The imagination is doubtless as active with them as with terrestrial beings, and if you can once touch the imagination, even of the most intelligent and instructed persons, you can do almost anything you choose with them. But how am I to convey to them any idea of this kind? Seeing neither sun, nor moon, nor stars, they can have no conception of such a thing as another world than their own."  "Couldn't you persuade them," said Jack, "that we come from the upper side of the cloud dome? You could pretend that it's very fine living up there--plenty of sunshine and good air."  Edmund laughed.  "I'm afraid, Jack, that they are too intelligent to believe that a person of your avoirdupois could walk on the clouds. You're not quite angelic enough for that. I'm sure that they know perfectly well what the dome consists of."  "The presence of Juba with us is another difficulty," I suggested. "If, as you suppose, they recognize certain racial characteristics in him, which convince them that he belongs to the other side of Venus, then they are sure to believe that we belong there, too."  "Certainly. But I must find some way round the difficulty. I depend upon the intelligence of Ala. If she had been killed, nothing could have saved us. We have had an unpleasant escape from something too closely resembling the misfortune of Oedipus."  In the meanwhile, we reached the capital and disembarked on the great tower. To our intense surprise and delight, instead of being reconducted to prison, we were led into a magnificent apartment, with open arches facing toward the distant mountains, and a repast was spread before us. Juba, to our great contentment, was allowed to accompany us. I think that Jack was the most pleased member of the party at the sight of the food. We sat at a round table, and I observed that the eatables consisted, as with Juba's people, exclusively of vegetables, except that there were birds, of species unknown to us, but of most exquisite flavor, and a light, white wine, the most delicious that I ever tasted.  When we had finished eating, we fell to admiring the view, and Jack pulled out his pipe, and, aided by Edmund's pocket lamp, which possessed an attachment for cigar lighting, began to smoke, leaning back luxuriously in his seat, with as much nonchalance as if he had been in the smoking room at the Olympus. I think I may say that we all exhibited a _sang froid_ amidst our novel surroundings that would have astonished us if we had stopped to analyze our feelings, but in that respect Jack was often the coolest member of the party, although he had not the iron nerves of Edmund. On this occasion, he was not long in producing a sensation. No sooner had the smoke begun to curl from his lips than the attendants in the room were thrown into a state of laughable consternation. Evidently they thought, like the servant of Walter Raleigh, that the smoke must come from an internal fire. Their looks showed alarm as well as astonishment.  "Keep your pipe concealed," whispered Edmund. "Take a few strong whiffs, and hide it in your pocket before they observe whence the smoke really comes. This may do us some good; it will, at least, serve to awake their imagination, and that is what we need."  Jack did as requested, first filling his mouth with smoke, and then slowly letting it out in puffs that more and more astonished the onlookers, who kept at a respectful distance, and excitedly discussed the phenomenon. Suddenly, Jack, with characteristic mobility of thought, turned to Edmund and demanded:  "Edmund, why didn't those fellows shoot us when we were running away? There were enough of them to bring us down with the wildest sort of shooting."  "They didn't shoot," was the reply, "because they had nothing to shoot with. I have made up my mind that they are an unwarlike people. I don't believe that they have the slightest idea what a gun is. Yet they are no cowards, and they'll fight if there is need of fighting, and no doubt they have weapons of some kind; only they are not natural slaughterers like ourselves, and I shouldn't be surprised if war is unknown on Venus.  "All the same," said Jack, "I wish I had my pistol back. I tried to hide it, but those fellows had their eyes on it, and it's confiscated. I'm glad you think they don't know how to use it."  "And I'm glad," returned Edmund, "that you haven't got your pistol. You've been altogether too handy with it. Now," he continued, "let us consider our situation. You see at a glance that we have gained a great deal as a result of the parley; the way we have just been treated here shows plainly enough that we shall, at least, have a fair trial, and we couldn't have counted on that before. You can never make people listen to reason against their inclination unless you hold certain advantages, and our advantage was that we clearly had it in our power to continue our flight. My only anxiety now is in regard to the means of holding them to the agreement--for agreement it certainly was--and of impressing them not only with a conviction of our innocence but with a sense of our reserve power, and the more mysterious I can make that power seem to them, the better. That is why I welcomed even the incident of Jack's smoking. We shall surely be arraigned before a court of some kind, and I imagine that we shall not have long to wait. What I wish particularly is that all of you shall desist from every thought of resistance, and follow strictly such instructions as I may have occasion to give you."  He had hardly ceased speaking when a number of official-looking persons entered the room where we were.  "Here come the cops," said Jack. "Now for the police court."  He was not very far wrong. We were gravely conducted to one of the little craft which served for elevators, and after a rapid descent, were led through a maze of passages terminating in a vast and splendid apartment, apparently perfectly square in plan, and at least three hundred feet on a side. It was half filled with a brilliant throng, in which our entry caused a sensation. Light entered through lofty windows on all four sides. The floor seemed to be of a rose-colored marble, with inlaid diapering of lapis lazuli, and the walls and ceiling were equally rich. But that which absolutely fascinated the eye in this great apartment was a huge circle high on the wall opposite the entrance door, like a great clock face, or the rose window of a cathedral, from which poured trembling streams of colored light.  "Chromatic music, once more," said Edmund, in a subdued voice. "Do you know, that has a strange effect upon my spirits, situated as we are. It is a prelude that may announce our fate; it might reveal to us the complexion of our judges, if I could but read its meaning."  "It is too beautiful to spell tragedy," I said.  "Ah, who knows? What is so fascinating as tragedy for those who are only lookers-on?"  "But, Edmund," I protested, "why do you, who are always the most hopeful, now fall into despondency?"  "I am not desponding," he replied, straightening up. "But this soundless music thrills me with its mysterious power, and sometimes it throws me into dejection, though I cannot tell why. To me, when what I firmly believe was the great anthem of this wonderful race, was played in the sky with spectral harmonies, there was, underlying all its mystic beauty, an infinite sadness, an impending sense of something tragic and terrible."  I was deeply surprised and touched by Edmund's manner, and would have questioned him further, but we were interrupted by the officials, who now led us across the vast apartment and to the foot of a kind of throne which stood directly under the great clock face. Then, for the first time, we recognized Ala, seated on the throne. Beside her was a person of majestic stature, with features like those of a statue of Zeus, and long curling hair of snowy whiteness. The severity of his aspect struck cold to my heart, but Ala's countenance was smiling and full of encouragement. As we were led to our places a hush fell upon the throng of attendants, and the colors ceased to play from the circle.  "Orchestra stopped," whispered the irrepressible Jack. "Curtain rises."  The pause that followed brought a fearful strain upon my nerves, but in a moment it was broken by Ala, who fixed her eyes upon Edmund's face as he stood a little in advance of the rest of us. He returned her regard unflinchingly. Every trace of the feeling which he had expressed to me was gone. He stood erect, confident, masterful, and as I looked, I felt a thrill of pride in him, pride in his genius which had brought us hither, pride in our mother earth--for were we not her far-wandering children?  [Illustration: "'Who and what are you, and whence do you come?'"]  I summoned all my powers in the effort to understand the tongueless speech which I knew was issuing from Ala's eyes. And I did understand it! Although there was not a sound, I would almost have sworn that my ears heard the words:  "Who and what are you, and whence do you come?"  Breathlessly I awaited Edmund's answer. He slowly lifted his hand and pointed upward. He was, then, going at once to proclaim our origin from another world; to throw over us the aegis of the earth!  The critical experiment had begun, and I shivered at the thought that here they knew no earth; here no flag could protect us. I saw perplexity and surprise in Ala's eyes and in those of the stern Zeus beside her. Suddenly a derisive smile appeared on the latter's lips, while Ala's confusion continued. God! Were we to fail at the very beginning?  Edmund calmly repeated his gesture, but it met with no response; no indication appeared to show that it awakened any feeling other than uncomprehending astonishment in one of his judges and derision in the other. And then, with a start, I caught sight of Ingra, standing close beside the throne, his face made more ugly by the grin which overspread it.  I was almost wild; I opened my mouth to cry I know not what, when there was a movement behind, and Juba stepped to Edmund's side, dropped on his knees, rose again, and fixed his great eyes upon the judges!  My heart bounded at the thoughts which now raced through my brain. Juba belonged to their world, however remote the ancestral connection might be; he possessed at least the elements of their unspoken language; and _it might be a tradition among his people, who we knew worshipped the earth-star, that it was a brighter world than theirs_. Had Edmund's gesture suddenly suggested to his mind the truth concerning us--a truth which the others had not his means of comprehending--and could he now bear effective testimony in our favor?  With what trembling anxiety I watched his movements! Edmund, too, looked at him with mingled surprise and interest in his face. Presently he raised his long arm, as Edmund had done, and pointed upward. A momentary chill of disappointment ran through me--could he do no more than that? But he _did_ more. Half unconsciously I had stepped forward where I could see his face. _His eyes were speaking._ I knew it. And, thank God! there was a gleam of intelligence answering him from the eyes of our judges.  He had made his point; he had suggested to them a thought of which they had never dreamed!  They did not thoroughly comprehend him; I could see that, for he must have been for them like one speaking a different dialect, to say nothing of the fundamental difficulty of the idea that he was trying to convey, but yet the meaning did not escape, and as he continued his strange communication, the wonder spread from face to face, for it was not only the judges who had grasped the general sense of what he was telling them. Even at that critical moment there came over me a feeling of admiration for a language like this; a truly universal language, not limited by rules of speech or hampered by grammatical structure. At length it became evident that Juba had finished, but he continued standing at Edmund's side.  Ala and her white-headed companion looked at one another, and I tried to read their thoughts. In her face, I believed that I could detect every sign of hope for us. Occasionally she glanced with a smile at Edmund. But the old judge was more implacable, or more incredulous. There was no kindness in his looks, and slowly it became clear that Ala and he were opposed in their opinion.  Suddenly she placed her hand upon her breast, where the bullet must have grazed her, and made an energetic gesture, including us in its sweep, which I interpreted to mean that she had no umbrage against those who had unintentionally injured her. It was plain that she insisted upon this point, making it a matter personal to herself, and my hopes rose when I thought that I detected signs of yielding on the part of the other. At this moment, when the decision seemed to hang in the balance, a new element was introduced into the case with dramatic suddenness and overwhelming force.  For several minutes I had seen nothing of Ingra, but my thoughts had been too much occupied with more important things to take heed of his movements. Now he appeared at the left of the throne, leading a file of fellows bearing a burden. They went direct to the foot of the throne, and deposited their burden within a yard of the place where Edmund was standing. They drew off a covering, and I could not repress a cry of consternation.  It was the body of one of their compatriots, and a glance at it sufficed to show the manner in which death had been inflicted. It had been crushed in a way which could probably mean nothing else than a fearful fall. The truth flashed upon me like a gleaming sword. The victim must have been precipitated from the air ship which we had struck at the beginning of our flight!  And there stood our enemy, Ingra, with exultation written on his features. He had made a master stroke, like a skillful prosecutor.  "Hang him!" I heard Jack mutter between his teeth. "Oh, if I only had my pistol!"  "Then you would make matters a hundred times worse," I whispered. "Keep your head, and remember Edmund's injunction."  The behavior of the latter again awoke my utmost admiration. Contemptuously turning his back upon Ingra, he faced Ala and old Zeus, and as their regards mingled, I knew well what he was trying to express. This time, since his meaning involved no conception lying utterly beyond their experience, he was more successful. He told them that the death of this person was a fact hitherto unknown to us, and that, like the injury to Ala, it had been inflicted without our volition. I believed that this plea, too, was accepted as valid by Ala; but not so with the other. He understood it perfectly, and he rejected it on the instant. My reason told me that nothing else could have been expected of him, for, truly, this was drawing it rather strong--to claim twice in succession immunity for evils which had undeniably originated from us.  Our case looked blacker and blacker, as it became evident that the opposition between our two judges had broken out again, and was now more decided than before. The features of the old man grew fearfully stern, and he rejected all the apparent overtures of Ala. He had been willing to pardon the injury and insult to her person, since she herself insisted upon pardon, but now the affair was entirely different. Whether purposely or not, we had caused the death of a subject of the realm, and he was not to be swerved aside from what he regarded as his duty. My nerves shook at the thought that we knew absolutely nothing about the social laws of this people, and that, among them, the rule of an eye for an eye, and blood for blood, might be more inviolable than it had ever been on the earth.  As the discussion proceeded, with an intensity which spoken words could not have imparted to it, Ala's cheeks began to glow, and her eyes to glitter with strange light. One could see the resistance in them rising to passion, and, at last, as the aged judge again shook his head, with greater emphasis than ever, she rose, as if suddenly transformed. The majestic splendor of her countenance was thrilling. Lifting her jeweled arm with an imperious gesture, she commanded the attendants to remove the bier, and was instantly obeyed. Then she beckoned to Edmund, and without an instant's hesitation, he stepped upon the lower stage of the throne. With the stride of a queen, she descended to his side, and, resting her hand on his shoulder, looked about her with a manner which said, as no words could have done:  "It is the power of my protection which encircles him!"    CHAPTER XII   MORE MARVELS  It was not until long afterwards that we fully comprehended all that Ala had done in that simple act; but I will tell you now what it meant. By the unwritten law of this realm of Venus, she, as queen, had the right to interpose between justice and its victim, and such interposition was always expressed in the way which we had witnessed. It was a right rarely exercised, and probably few then present had ever before seen it put into action. The sensation which it caused was, in consequence, exceedingly great, and a murmur of astonishment arose from the throng in the great apartment, and hundreds pressed around the throne, staring at us and at the queen. The majestic look which had accompanied her act gradually faded, and her features resumed their customary expression of kindness. The old judge had risen as she stepped from her place beside him, and he seemed as much astonished as any onlooker. His hands trembled, he shook his head, and a single word came from his mouth, pronounced with a curious emphasis. Ala turned to him, with a new defiance in her eyes, before which his opposition seemed to wither, and he sank back into his seat.  But there was at least one person present who accepted the decision with a bad grace--Ingra. He had been sure of victory in his incomprehensible persecution of us, he had played a master card, and now his disappointment was written upon his face. With surprise, I saw Ala approach him, smiling, and I was convinced that she was trying to persuade him to cease his opposition. There was a gentleness in her manner--almost a deference--which grated upon my feelings, while Jack's disgust could find no words sufficient to express itself:  "Beauty and the beast!" he growled. "By Jo, if _he's_ got any influence over her, I'm sorry for her."  "Well, well, don't worry about him," I said. "He's played his hand and lost, and if you were in his place, you wouldn't feel any better about it."  "No, I'd go and hang myself, and that's what he ought to do. But isn't _she_ a queen, though!"  Ala now resumed her place upon the throne, and issued orders which resulted in our being conducted to apartments that were set aside for us in the palace. There were four connecting rooms, and Juba had one of them. But we immediately assembled in the chief apartment, which had been assigned to Edmund. There was much more deference in the manner of our attendants than we had observed before, and as soon as they left us we fell to discussing the recent events. Jack's first characteristic act was joyously to slap Juba on the back:  "Bully old boy!" he exclaimed. "Edmund, where'd we have been without Juba?"  "I ought to have foreseen that," said Edmund. "If I had been as wise as I sometimes think myself, I'd have arranged the thing differently. Of course it should have been obvious all the while that Juba would be our trump card. I dimly saw that, but I ought to have instructed him in advance. As it was, his own intelligence did the business. He understood my claim to an origin outside this planet, when they could not. It must have come over him all at a flash."  "But do you think that they understand it now?" I asked.  "To a certain extent, yes. But it is an utterly new idea to them, and all the better for us that it is so. It is so much the more mysterious; so much the more effective with the imagination. But this is not the end of it; they will want to know more--especially Ala--and now that Juba has broken the ice, it will be comparatively easy to fortify the new opinion which they have conceived of us."  "But Ingra nearly wrecked it all," I remarked.  "Yes, that was a stunning surprise. How devilish cunning the fellow is; and how inexplicable his antipathy to us."  "I believe that it is a kind of jealousy," I said.  "A kind of natural cussedness, _I_ guess," put in Jack.  "Why should he be jealous?" asked Edmund.  "I don't know, exactly; but you know we are not simple barbarians in their eyes, and Ingra may have conceived a prejudice against us, somehow, on that very account."  "Very unlikely," Edmund returned, "but we shall find out all about it in time; in the meanwhile, do nothing to prejudice him further, for he is a power that we have got to reckon with."  The conversation then turned upon the mysterious language that had been employed at what we called the trial. I expressed the admiration which I had felt for such a means of communication when I had observed the effect that Juba had been able to produce.  "Yes," said Edmund, "it seems as wonderful as it is beautiful, but there is no reason why it should not have been acquired by the inhabitants of the earth. We have the elements, not merely in what we call telepathy, or mind reading, but in our everyday converse. Try it yourself, and you will be astonished at what the eyes, the looks, are able to convey. Even abstract ideas are not beyond their reach. Often we abandon speech for this better method of conveying our meaning. How many a turn in the history of mankind has depended upon the unspoken diplomacy of the eyes; how many a crisis in our personal lives is determined, not by words, but by looks."  "That's right," said Jack, "more matches are made with eyes than with lips."  Edmund smiled and continued: "There's nothing really mysterious about it. It has a purely physical basis, and only needs attention and development to become the most perfect mode of mental communication that intellectual beings could possibly possess."  "And the music and language of color?" I asked. "How has that been developed?"  "As naturally as the silent speech. We have it, and we feel it, in pictures, in flower gardens, and in landscapes; only with us it is a frozen music. Living music exists on the earth only in the form of sonorous vibrations because we have not developed our sense of the harmony of colors except when they lie dead and motionless before us. A great painting by Raphael or Turner is to one of these color hymns of Venus like a printed score, which merely suggests its harmonies, compared with the same composition when poured forth from a perfect instrument under the fingers of a master player."  "Well, Edmund," interposed Jack, "I've no doubt it's all as you say, and I'd like to know just enough of their speechless speech to tell Ingra what he ought to hear; and if I understood their music, I'd play him a dead march, sure."  "But," continued Edmund, disregarding Jack's interruption, "mark me, there's something else behind all this. I have a dim foreglimpse of it, and if we have luck, we'll know more before long."  I find that the enthusiasm which these wonderful memories arouse, as they flood back into my mind, is leading me to dwell upon too many details, and I must sum up in fewer words the story of the events which immediately followed our acquittal, although it involves some of the most astonishing discoveries that we made in the world of Venus.  As Edmund had surmised, Ala lost no time in seeking more light upon the mystery surrounding us. Within twenty-four hours after the dramatic scene in the hall of judgment, we were summoned before her, in a splendid apartment, which was apparently an audience chamber, where we found her surrounded by several of her female attendants, as well as by what seemed to be high officers of the court; and among them, to our displeasure, was Ingra. He, in fact, appeared to be the most respected and important personage there, next to the queen herself, and he kept close by her side. Edmund glanced at him, and half turning to us, shook his head. I took his meaning to be that we were not to manifest any annoyance over Ingra's presence.  The queen was very gracious, and seats were offered to us. Immediately she began to question Edmund, as I could see; but with all my efforts I could make out nothing of what was "said." But Juba evidently was able to follow much of the conversation, in which he manifested the liveliest interest. The conference lasted about an hour, and at its conclusion, we retired to our apartments. There we eagerly questioned Edmund concerning what had occurred.  He seemed to be greatly impressed and pleased. He told us that he had learned more than he had communicated, but that he had succeeded, as he believed, in making clearer to Ala our celestial origin. Still, he doubted if she fully comprehended it, while as for Ingra, he was sure that the fellow rejected our claim entirely, and persisted in regarding us as inhabitants of the dark hemisphere.  "Bosh!" cried Jack. "He's too stupid to understand anything above the level of his nose, and I'd like to flatten that for him!"  "No," said Edmund, "he's not stupid, but I'm afraid he's malicious. If he were a little more stupid, it would be the better for us."  "But does Ala comprehend the difference between us and Juba--I mean in regard to origin?" I asked.  "I think so. In fact Juba bears unmistakable signs that he is of their world, although so different in physical appearance. His remarkable comprehension of their method of mental communication is alone sufficient to stamp him as ancestrally one of them. And yet," Edmund continued, musing, "think of the vast stretch of ages that separates the inhabitants of the two sides of this planet, the countless eons of evolution that have brought about the differences now existing! I am delighted to find that Ala has some understanding of all this. She has had good teachers--do not smile--for what you have seen of their mechanical achievements proves that science exists and is cultivated here; and from her savants she has learned--what our astronomers have deduced--that formerly Venus turned rapidly on her axis, and had days and nights swiftly succeeding one another. But they do not know the scientific reasons as completely as we do. With them this is knowledge based largely upon tradition, 'ancestral voices' echoing down through periods of time so vast that our most ancient legends seem but tales of yesterday. Whatever may be the measure of man's antiquity on the earth, I am certain that here intellectual life has existed for millions upon millions of years, and its history stretches back beyond the time when the brake of tidal friction had so far destroyed the rotation of the planet that its surface became permanently divided between the reigns of day and night."  I listened with amazement and could not help exclaiming:  "But, Edmund, how could you learn all this in so short a time?"  "Because," he replied, smiling, "the language of the mind, unhampered by dragging words and blundering sentences, plays back and forth with the quickness of thought. There is another thing, too, which I have learned, a thing so amazing that it daunts me. I have found, I believe, the explanation of that minor note of infinite sadness which, as I told you, I always feel, even in the most joyous-seeming paeans of their color music. I think it is due to their forereaching science, which assures them that this world has entered upon the last stage of its existence which began with the arrest of its axial rotation, and which will end with the total extinction of life through the evaporation of all the waters under the never-setting sun, and the consequent complete desiccation of this now so beautiful land."  "But," I objected, "you have said that they never see the sun."  "That was, I believe, a mistake, I am sure that they never see the stars or the planets, but I think that sometimes they see the sun, or, at least that there is a tradition of its having been seen. The whole thing is yet obscure to me, but I have received an inkling of something very, very strange in that regard."  "Then, Ala may think that it is from the sun that we claim to come," I said, disregarding his last remark, which had a significance which even he could not then have appreciated.  "I am not sure; we must wait for further light. But I have still another communication not so instinct with mystery. We are to be shown the sources of their mechanical power--the means by which they run all their motors."  "Hurrah," cried Jack. "Now, that's something I like! I can understand a machine--if you don't ask me to run it--but as for this talking through the eyes, and playing Jim Crow with rainbows, it's too much for me."  It was not many hours later when we were conducted by Ala, accompanied as usual by the inevitable Ingra, and a brilliant cortege of attendants, upon our first excursion through the capital. We embarked in a gorgeous air ship, and flying low at first, skirted the roofs of the innumerable houses which constituted the bulk of the city resting on the ground. The oriental magnificence of the views which we caught in the winding streets and frequent squares crowded with people, excited our interest to the utmost. But we kept on without descending or stopping until, at length, we passed the limits of the immense metropolis, and, flying more rapidly, and at a greater elevation, soon approached what, at a distance, appeared to be a waterfall, greater than Niagara, pouring out of the air!  "What marvel can this be?" I asked.  "A fountain," responded Edmund.  "A cataract turned upside down," exclaimed Jack. "Well, I've ceased to be surprised at anything I see here. I wouldn't be astonished now to find that their whole old planet was hollow, and full of gnomes, or whatever you call 'em."  When we got nearer we saw that Edmund's description was substantially correct. The vast mass of water gushed from the top of a broad plateau, in the form of a gigantic vertical fountain, with a roar so stupendous that Ala and her attendants immediately covered their ears with protectors, and we should not have been sorry to follow their example, for our eardrums were almost burst by the billowing force of the sound waves. The water shot upward four or five hundred feet with geyser-like plumes reaching a thousand feet, and then descended in floods on all sides. But the slope of the ground was such that eventually it was all collected in a river, which flowed away with great swiftness, past the distant city, and disappeared in the direction of the sea from which we had come. The solid column of rising water must have been, at its base, three hundred feet in diameter!  But our amazement was redoubled when we recognized, at various points of vantage, squat, metallic towers of enormous strength, which caught the descending water, allowing it to issue in roaring torrents from their bases.  "Those," shouted Edmund in our ears, "are power houses. I knew already that these people had learned the mechanical uses of electricity; and if we have seen no electric lights as yet, it is because, in a world of perpetual daylight, they have little or no use for them. They employ the power for other purposes."  "But how do you account for this incredible fountain?" I asked.  "It must be due to geological causes, if I may use a terrestrial term. You observe that the land all has a slope hitherward from the distant range of mountains, and that between us and the sea there is a chain of hills. The metropolis lies at the lower edge of a vast basin, and it must be that the relatively porous surface, over many thousands of square miles, is underlain by an almost unbroken shell of rock, impermeable to water. The result is that the drainage of this whole immense region, after being collected under ground, flows together to this point, where the existence of a huge vent in the upper layer offers it a way of escape, and it comes spouting out of the great crater with the consequences which you behold."  Many objections to Edmund's theory occurred to my mind; but he spoke so confidently, the course of things on this strange planet had so often followed his indications, and I felt myself so incapable of suggesting a more satisfactory hypothesis, that I made no reply, as a geologist, perhaps, would have done. At any rate the wonderful phenomenon existed before our eyes, explanation or no explanation. We learned afterwards that the river formed by the giant fountain passed through a gap in the hills to the seaward, and the more I reflected upon Edmund's idea the more acceptable I found it.  A great deal of the water was led away from the foot of the plateau out of which the fountain issued by ditches constructed to irrigate the rich gardens surrounding the metropolis and the open agricultural country for many miles around. At the queen's invitation, although she did not accompany us, we inspected one of the power houses, and Edmund found the greatest delight in studying the details of the enormous dynamos and the system of cables by which, quite in our own manner, the electric power was conveyed to the city. We noticed that everywhere the most ingenious devices were employed for killing noise.  "I knew we should find all this," said Edmund--"although I did not precisely anticipate the form that the natural supply of energy would take--as soon as I saw the aerial screws that give buoyancy to the great towers. In fact, I foresaw it as soon as I found, in inspecting the machinery of the air ship which brought us from the sea, that their motors were driven by storage batteries. It was obvious, then, that they had some extraordinary source of energy."  "Oh, of course, you knew it all!" muttered Henry under his breath. "But if you were as omniscient as you think yourself, you'd not be in this fool's paradise."  "What's that you're saying?" demanded Jack, partly catching the import of Henry's remark, and beginning to ruffle his feathers.  "Oh, nothing," mumbled Henry, and I shook my head at Jack to keep quiet. We all felt at times Edmund's assumption of superiority, but Jack and I were willing to put up with it as one of the privileges of genius. If Edmund had not believed in himself, he would never have brought us through. And besides, we always found that he was right, and if he sometimes spoke rather boastingly of his knowledge and foresight, at least it was real knowledge and genuine foresight.    CHAPTER XIII   WE FALL INTO TROUBLE AGAIN  It was not long after our visit to the marvelous fountain when Jack proposed to me that he and I should make a little excursion on our own account in the city. Edmund was absent at the moment, engaged in some inquiries which interested him, under the guidance of Ala and her customary attendants. I forget why Jack and I had stayed behind, since both Juba and Henry had accompanied Edmund, but it was probably because we wished to make some necessary repairs to our garments for I confess that I shared a little of the coquettishness of Jack in that matter. At any rate, we grew weary of being alone, and decided to venture just a little way in search of adventure. We calculated that the tower of the palace, which was so conspicuous, would serve us as a landmark, and that there was no danger of getting lost.  Nobody interfered with us at our departure, as we had feared they might, and in a short time we had become so absorbed in the strange spectacles of the narrow streets, lined with shops and filled with people on foot, while small air ships continually passed just above the roofs, that we forgot the necessity of keeping our landmark constantly in view, and were lost without knowing it.  One thing which immediately struck us was the entire absence of beasts of burden--nothing like horses or mules did we see. There were not even dogs, although, as I have told you, some canine-like animals dwelt with the people of the caverns. Everybody went either on foot or in air ships. There were no carriages, except a kind of palanquin, some running on wheels and others borne by hand.  "I should think they would have autos," said Jack, "with all their science and ingenuity which Edmund admires so much."  But there was not a sign of anything resembling an auto; the silence of the crowded streets was startling, and made the scene more dreamlike. Everybody appeared to be shod with some noise-absorbing material. We strolled along, turning corners with blissful carelessness, staring and being stared at (for, of course, everybody knew who we were), peering into open doors and the gaping fronts of bazaars, chattering like a couple of boys making their first visit to a city, and becoming every moment more hopelessly, though unconsciously, lost, and more interested by what we saw. The astonishing display of pleasing colors and the brilliancy of everything fascinated us. I had never seen anything comparable to this in beauty, variety, and richness. We passed a market where we saw some of the bright-plumaged birds that we had eaten at our first repast hung up for sale. They had a way of serving these birds at table with the brilliant feathers of the head and neck still attached, as if they found a gratification even at their meals in seeing beautiful colors before them.  Other shops were filled with birds in gilded cages, which we should have taken for songsters but for the fact that, although crowds gathered about and regarded them with mute admiration, not a sound issued from their throats--at least we heard none. A palanquin stopped at one of these shops, and a lady alighted and bought three beautiful birds which she carried away in their cages, watching them with every indication of the utmost pleasure, which we ascribed to the splendor of their plumage and the gracefulness of their forms. As a crowd watched the transaction without interference on the part of the shopkeeper, or evidence of annoyance on that of the lady, we took the liberty of a close look ourselves. Then we saw their money.  "Good, yellow gold," whispered Jack.  Such, indeed, it seemed to be. The lady took the money, which consisted of slender rings, chased with strange characters, from a golden purse, and the whole transaction seemed so familiar that we might well have believed ourselves to be witnessing a purchase in a bazaar of Cairo or Damascus. This scene led to a desire on Jack's part to buy something himself.  "If I only had some of their money," he said, "I'd like to get some curiosities to carry home. I wonder if they'd accept these?" and he drew from his pocket some gold and silver coins.  "No doubt they'd be glad to have a few as keepsakes," I said.  "By Jo! I think I'll try it," said Jack, "but not here. I'm not a bird fancier myself. Let's look a little farther."  We wandered on, getting more and more interested, and followed by a throng of curious natives, who treated us, I must say, much more respectfully than we should have been treated in similar circumstances at home. Many of the things we saw, I cannot describe, because there is nothing to liken them to, but all were as beautiful as they were strange. At last we found a shop whose contents struck Jack's fancy. The place differed from any that we had yet seen; it was much larger, and more richly fitted up than the others, and there were no counters, the things that it contained being displayed on the inner walls, while a single keeper, of a grave aspect, and peculiarly attired, all in black, occupied a seat at the back. The objects on view were apparently ornaments to be hung up, as we hang plaques on the wall. They were of both gold and silver, and in some the two metals were intermixed, with pleasing effects. What seemed singular was the fact that the _motif_ of the ornaments was always the same, although greatly varied in details of execution. As near as I could make it out, the intention appeared to be to represent a sunburst. There was invariably a brilliant polished boss in the center, sometimes set with a jewel, and surrounding rays of crinkled form, which plunged into a kind of halo that encircled the entire work. The idea was commonplace, and it did not occur to me amidst my admiration of the extreme beauty of the workmanship that there was any cause for surprise in the finding of a sunburst represented here. Jack was enthusiastic.  "That's the ticket for me," he said. "How would one of those things look hanging over the fireplace of old Olympus? You bet I'm going to persuade the old chap to exchange one for a handful of good solid American money."  I happened to glance behind us while Jack was scooping his pocket, and was surprised to see that the crowd of idlers, which had been following us, had dispersed. Looking out of the doorway, I saw some of them furtively regarding us from a respectful distance. I twitched Jack by the sleeve:  "See here," I said, "there's some mistake about this. I don't believe that this is a shop. You'd better be careful, or we may make a bad break."  "Oh, pshaw!" he replied; "it's a shop all right, or if it isn't exactly a shop that old duffer will be glad to get a little good money for one of his gimcracks."  My suspicion that all was not right was not allayed when I noticed that the old man, whose complexion differed from the prevailing tone here, and who was specially remarkable by the possession of an eagle-beaked nose, a peculiarity that I had not before observed among these people, began to frown as Jack brusquely approached him. But I could not interfere before Jack had thrown a handful of coin in his lap, and, reaching up, had put his hand upon one of the curious sunbursts, saying:  "I guess this will suit; what do you say, Peter?"  Instantly the old fellow sprang to his feet, sending the coins rolling over the polished floor, and with eyes ablaze with anger, seized Jack by the throat. I sprang to his aid, but in a second four stout fellows, darting out of invisible corners, grappled us, and before we could make any effective resistance, they had our arms firmly bound behind our backs! Jack exerted all his exceptional strength to break loose, but in vain.  "I tried to stop you, Jack--" I began, in a tone of annoyance, but immediately he cut me off:  "This is on _me_, Peter; don't you worry. _You_ haven't done anything."  "I'm afraid it's on all of us," I replied. "The whole party, Edmund and all, may have to suffer for our heedlessness."  "Fiddlesticks," he returned. "I haven't got his old ornament, but he's got my coin. This looks like a skin game to me. What in thunder did he hang the things up for if he didn't want to sell 'em?"  "But I told you this wasn't a shop."  "No, I see it isn't; it's a trap for suckers, I guess."  Jack's indignation grew hotter as we were dragged out into the street, and followed by a crush of people drawn to the scene, were hurried along, we knew not whither. In fact, his indignation swallowed up the alarm which he ought to have experienced, and which I felt in full force. I beat my brains in vain to find some explanation for the merciless severity with which we were treated so out of all proportion to the venial fault that had unconsciously been committed, and my perplexity grew when I saw in the faces of the crowd surrounding us, and running to keep up, a look of horror, as if we had been guilty of an unspeakable crime. We were too much hurried and jolted by our captors to address one another, and in a short time we were widely separated, Jack being led, or rather dragged, ahead, as if to prevent any communication between us. Once in a while, to my regret, I observed him exerting all his force to break his bonds and slinging his custodians about; but he could not get away, and at last, to my infinite comfort, he ceased to struggle, and went along as quietly as the rapid pace would permit.  Presently an air ship swooped down from above, and alighted in a little square which we had just entered. Immediately we were taken aboard, with small regard to our comfort, and the air ship rose rapidly, and bore off in the direction of the great tower of the palace which we could now see. Upon our arrival we were taken through the inevitable labyrinth of corridors, and finally found ourselves in a place that was entirely new to us.  It was a round chamber, perhaps two hundred feet in diameter, lighted, like the Roman Pantheon, by a huge circular opening in the vaulted roof, through which I caught a glimpse of the pearl-tinted cloud dome, which seemed infinitely remote. No opposition was made when I pushed ahead in order to be at Jack's side, and as a throng quickly hedged us round, our conductors released their hold, although our arms remained bound. When at last we stood fast we were in front of a rich dais, containing a thronelike seat occupied by a personage attired in black, the first glimpse of whose face gave me such a shock as I had not experienced since the priest of the earth-worshipers seized me for his prey. I have never seen anything remotely resembling that face. It was without beard, and of a ghastly paleness. It was seen only in profile, except when, with a lightning-like movement, it turned, for the fraction of a second, toward us, and was instantly averted again. It made my nerves creep to look at it. The nose was immense, resembling a huge curved beak, and the eyes, as black and glittering as jet, were roofed with shaggy brows, and seemed capable of seeing crosswise.  Sometimes one side of the face and sometimes the other was presented, the transition being effected by two instantaneous jerks, with a slight pause between, during which the terrible eyes transfixed us. At such moments the creature--though he bore the form of a man--seemed to project his dreadful countenance toward the object of his inspection like a monstrous bird stretching forth its neck toward its prey. The effect was indescribable, terrifying, paralyzing! The eyes glowed like fanned embers.  "In God's name," gasped Jack, leaning his trembling shoulder upon me, "what is it?"  I was, perhaps, more unmanned than he, and could make no reply.  Then there was a movement in the throng surrounding us, and the old man of the sunbursts appeared before the throne, and, after dropping on his knees and rising again, indicated us with his long finger, and, as was plain, made some serious accusation. The face turned upon us again with a longer gaze than usual, and we literally shrank from it. Then its owner rose from his seat, towering up, it seemed, to a height of full seven feet, shot his hand out with a gesture of condemnation, and instantly sat down again and averted his countenance. There seemed to have been a world of meaning in this brief act to those who could comprehend it. We were seized, even more roughly than before, and dragged from the chamber, and at the end of a few minutes found ourselves thrown into a dungeon, where there was not the slightest glimmer of light, and the door was locked upon us.  It was a long time before either of us summoned up the courage to speak. At length I said faintly:  "Jack, I'm afraid it's all over with us. We must have done something terrible, though I cannot imagine what it was."  But Jack, after his manner, was already recovering his spirits, and he replied stoutly:  "Nonsense, Peter, we're all right, as Edmund says. Wait till he comes and he'll fix it."  "But how can he know what has happened? And what could he do if he did? More likely they will all be condemned along with us."  Jack felt around in the dark and got me by the hand, giving it a hearty pressure.  "Remember Ala," he said. "She's our friend, or Edmund's, and they'll bring us out of this. You want to brace up."  "Remember Ingra!" I responded with a shiver, and I could feel Jack start at the words.  "Hang him!" he muttered. "If I'd only finished him when I had the drop!"  After that neither spoke. If Jack's thoughts were blacker than mine he must have wished for his pistol to blow out his own brains. At no time since our arrival on the planet had I felt so depressed. I had no courage left; could see no lightening of the gloom anywhere. In the horror of the darkness which enveloped us, the _horror of space_ came over my spirit. One feels a little of that sometimes when the breadth of an ocean separates him from home, and from all who really care for him--but what is the Atlantic or the Pacific to millions upon millions of leagues of interplanetary space! To be cast away among the inhabitants of another world than one's own! To have lost, as we had done (for in that moment of despair I was _sure_ Edmund could never repair the car), the only possible means of return! To have offended, just _because_ we were strangers, and _could_ not know better, some incomprehensible social law of this strange people, who owned not a drop of the blood of our race, or of any race whatsoever dwelling on the earth! To lie under the condemnation of that goblin face, without the possibility of pleading even the mercy that our hearts instinctively grant to the smallest mite of fellow life on our own planet! To be alone! friendless! forsaken! condemned!--in a far-off, kinless world! I could have fallen down in idolatry before a grain of sand from the shore of the Atlantic!  In the murkiest depth of my despair a sound roused me with a shock that made my heart ache. In a moment the door opened, light streamed in, and Edmund stood there.    CHAPTER XIV   THE SUN GOD  Strangely enough, I, who have an exceptional memory for spoken words, cannot, by any effort, recall what Edmund said, as his face beamed in upon us. I have only a confused recollection that he spoke, and that his words had a marvelous effect upon my broken spirit. But I can see, as if it were yet before me, the smile that illumined his features. My heart bounded with joy, as if a messenger had come straight from the earth itself, bearing a reprieve whose authority could not be called in question.  Jack's joy was no less than mine, although he had not suffered mentally as I had done. And the sight of Ala was hardly less reassuring to us, but to find Ingra, too, present was somewhat of a shock to our confidence in speedy delivery from trouble. And, in fact, we were not at once delivered. We had to spend many weary hours yet in our dark prison, but they were rendered less gloomy by Edmund's assurance that he would save us. The confidence that he always inspired seems to me to have been another mark of his genius. We had an instinct that he could do in any circumstances what was impossible to ordinary men.  At last the welcome moment came, and we were led forth, free, and rejoined Edmund, Henry, and Juba in our apartments. Then, for the first, we learned what we had done, and how narrow had been our escape from a terrible doom. It was a new chapter of wonder that Edmund opened before us. I shall tell it in his own words.  "When I returned to the palace and found you missing I was greatly wrought up. Immediately I applied to Ala for aid in finding you. She was quickly informed of all the circumstances of your arrest, and I saw at once, by the expression of her features, that it was a matter of the utmost gravity. I was not reassured by Ingra's evident joy. I could read in his face the pleasure that the news gave him, and I perceived that there was again opposition between him and Ala, and that she was trying, with less success than I hoped for, to bring him round to her view.  "With no little trouble I finally discovered the nature of your offense. I understood it the more readily because I had already begun to suspect the existence among these people of a strange form of idolatry, in some respects akin to the earth-worship of the cavern dwellers. I have told you that certain things had led me to think that they occasionally see the sun here. It is a phenomenon of excessive rarity, and whole generations sometimes pass without its recurrence. It is due to an opening which at irregular periods forms for a brief space of time in the cloud dome. I imagine that it may be in some way connected with sunspots, but here they have no notion of its cause, and look upon it as entirely miraculous.  "Whenever this rare event occurs it gives rise to extraordinary religious excitement, and ceremonies concerning which there is some occult mystery that I have not yet penetrated. I suspect that the ceremonies are not altogether unlike the Bacchanalian festivals of ancient Greece. At any rate the momentary appearance of the sun at these times is regarded as the avatar of a supreme god, and their whole religious system is based upon it. So universal and profound is the superstition to which it gives rise that the most instructed persons among them are completely under its dominion. The eagle-beaked individual who condemned you, and whom I have since seen, is the chief priest of this superstition, and within his sphere his power is unlimited. It is solely to the belief--which, through Ala, I have succeeded in impressing upon him--that we are _children of the sun_ that I owe the success of my efforts in your behalf. Without that you would surely have been sacrificed, and we with you.  "One of the forms which this superstition takes is a belief that the anger of the sun god can be mollified by offerings of images, made in his likeness, which are first consecrated by the chief priest, and then hung up on the walls of certain small temples, which are scattered through the city, and are always kept open to the air under the guard of a minor priest and his attendants. A whole family, as I understand it, deems itself protected by one of these images, which are made by artists who never touch any other work, and which are only granted to those who have undergone a painful series of purifications in the great temple. The preliminary ceremonies finished, the images are suspended, and at certain times those to whom they belong go and kneel and pray before them, as before their guardian saints."  "What a fool I was not to understand it," I murmured.  "You will understand now," Edmund continued, "how serious was Jack's offense in insulting a priest, and laying impious hands upon a sacred image, belonging, no doubt, to a family whose antiquity of descent would make our oldest pedigrees on the earth seem as ephemeral as the existence of a May fly; for I am convinced that here life has gone on, uninterrupted by wars and changes of dynasty, for untold ages.  "It is a marvel that you escaped, for already they were preparing the awful sacrifice. The chief priest was amazed when an interposition was made on your behalf. Such a thing had never been known, and, as I have said, it was only by acting upon his superstition that I succeeded, with Ala's assistance, in obtaining a reprieve. As the case stands, we find ourselves occupying a dangerous eminence, which it may be difficult for us to maintain. I must beseech you to be on your guard, and to act only under my direction. It is all the more serious for us because I am convinced that Ingra has no faith whatever in the legend which protects us. He persists in believing that we are simply interlopers from the dark hemisphere, and the opposition between him and Ala has now become so sharp that he would gladly witness our destruction. I am sure that he will do his utmost to unmask us, and thus send us to our death."  "But--" I began.  "Wait a moment," said Edmund, "I have not yet finished. I must now tell you who Ingra is. _He is the destined consort of Ala._ That explains his influence over her. From what I can make out, it appears that he is of the royal blood, and that the marriage of the queen is arranged, not by her preference, but by an unwritten law, administered by the chief priest. She has no choice in the matter."  "I should say not," broke in Jack. "She never would have chosen that jackanapes! If you hadn't spoiled my aim I'd have relieved her of the burden."  "Not another word of that!" said Edmund severely. "In no manner, not even by a look, are you ever to express your dislike of him. And remember, you must govern your very thoughts, for here they lie open, as legible as print."  "Hang me," growled Jack, "if I like a world where a man can't even think his own thoughts because his mind goes bare! Take me back where you have to speak before you are understood."  "When you have wicked thoughts don't look them in the eyes," said Edmund, half smiling, "and then you will run no danger. It is through the eyes that they read. Now, to resume what I was saying, I am more than ever anxious to recover the car, and to find the materials that will enable me to repair its machinery. With it in our possession, and in good shape, we shall be in a position to run away whenever it may seem necessary to do so, and in the meantime to impose our legend upon them by the possession of so apparently miraculous a means of conveying ourselves through space. It will be overwhelming proof of the truth of our assertion of an origin outside their world, and perhaps, upon the whole, it is just as well that they should think that we belong to the sun, of whose existence they have some knowledge, rather than to the earth, of which they know nothing, in spite of the inkling that Juba succeeded in conveying to them."  "The car is here, isn't it?" I asked.  "Yes, it is in the great tower, but it is useless in its present condition."  "And what materials do you want to find?"  "Primarily nothing but uranium. They understand chemistry here. They have the apparatus that I need, but they do not know how to use it as I do. The uranium certainly exists somewhere. They mine gold and silver, and other things, and when I can find their mines, without exciting their suspicion, and can get the use of a laboratory in secret, I shall soon have what I need. But I must be very circumspect, for it would not do to let them perceive that chemistry really lies at the basis of our miracle. It is this necessity for secrecy which troubles me most. But I shall find a way."  "For God's sake, find it quick," Henry burst out. "And then get away from this accursed planet."  Edmund looked at him a moment before replying:  "We shall go when the necessity for going arises, and not before. We have not yet seen all the interesting things of this world."  I believe that even Jack and I shared to some extent Henry's disappointment on hearing this announcement. We should have been glad to know that we were to start on the return journey as soon as the car was in shape to transport us. But the event proved that Edmund's instinct was, as usual, right, and that the things which were yet to be seen and experienced were well worth the fearful risk we ran in remaining.  While Edmund undertook the delicate inquiries which were necessary in order to determine the direction that his search for uranium should take, and to enable him to conduct his chemical processes without awaking suspicion as to his real purpose, we were left much of the time in charge of a party of attendants who, by his intercession, had been selected to act as our guides when we wished to examine the wonders of the palace and the capital. Sometimes he accompanied us; but more often he was with Ala and her suite, including her uneludable satellite, Ingra.  "I bless my stars that he doesn't favor _us_ with his delightful company," was Jack's comment, when he saw Ingra tagging along after Ala and Edmund.  I privately believed that Ingra had his spies among our attendants, but I was careful not to mention my suspicions to Jack.  But, oh, the delight of those excursions! Those streets; and those aerial towers, which rose like forests of coral in a gulf of liquid ether! They shine often in my dreams. A thousand times I have tried to put into words, simply for my own satisfaction, a description of the things that we saw, and the impressions that they made on my mind--but it is impossible. I understand now why the tales of travelers into strange lands never convey a tithe of what is in the writers' minds; they simply cannot; the necessary words and analogies do not exist. I can only use general terms, ransacking the vocabulary of adjectives--"beautiful," "wonderful," "fascinating," "marvelous," "indescribable," "magical," "enchanting," "amazing," "inexplicable," "_sans pareil_"--what you will--but all that says nothing except to my own mind. Only the language of Venus could describe the charms and the wonders of Venus!  There was one thing, however, which was sufficiently comprehensible--_the great library_. Edmund was not with us when we paid our first visit to it; but he had predicted its existence during one of our conversations, when we were talking of the silent language.  "This people," he had said, "has a great history behind it, extending over periods which would amaze our disinterrers of human antiquity, but an intelligent race cannot make history without also keeping records of it. Tradition alone, handed on from mind to mind, would not answer their requirements. The possession of the power to communicate thought without spoken language does not presuppose a power of memory any more perfect than we have. The brain forgets, the imagination misleads, with them as with us, and consequently they must have books of some kind--which implies a written or printed language. It is probable that this language does not correspond with the very meager one of which we occasionally hear them pronounce a few words. The latter is, I am convinced, used only for names and interjections, and sometimes to call the attention of the person addressed, while the former must be a rich and carefully elaborated system of literary expression, which may not be phonetic at all. We shall find that this is so; and there are unquestionably libraries--probably a great imperial library--devoted to history and science. There must be schools also."  Thus Edmund had spoken, and thus we found it to be. The great library was in a building separate from the palace. It was admirably lighted from without, and its nature was apparent the moment we were led into it. The "books" were long scrolls, which might have been taken for parchment or papyrus, and the characters written on them resembled those of the Chinese language, but worked out in exquisite colors, which might themselves have had a meaning. The rolls were kept in proper receptacles under the charge of librarians, and we saw many grave persons at desks poring over them. Absolute silence reigned, and as I gazed at the scene I found admiration for this extraordinary people taking the place of the prejudice which I had recently been led to feel against them.  Jack, unusually impressed, whispered to me that Edmund must have been playing us some Hindoo bedevilment trick, for he could not believe that we were actually in a foreign world. The same impression came over me. This was too earthlike; too much as if, instead of being on the planet Venus, we had been transported to some land of antique civilization in our own world. But, after all, we _knew where we were_, and as the realization of that fact came to us we could only stare with increasing astonishment at the scene before us. I may say here that Edmund subsequently visited this great library, and also some of the schools, and I know that he made notes of what he discovered and learned in them, with the purpose, as I supposed, of writing upon the subject after his return. But the expected book, which would have supplemented and clarified much of what I have undertaken to tell, with but a half understanding of what we saw, never appeared.  Our wonderful excursions came to an end when Edmund at length announced that he had obtained the information he needed, and that we were about to make a trip to some of the mines of Venus.  "I have discovered," he said, "that Venus is exceedingly rich in the precious metals, as well as in iron and lead. They mine them all, and we shall visit the mines under Ala's escort. My real purpose, of course, is to find uranium, of whose properties, strangely--and for us luckily--enough, they seem to have no knowledge. Nevertheless, they are capital chemists as far as they go, and possess laboratories provided with all that I shall need. They refine the metals at the mines themselves, so that I am sure of finding everything necessary to do my work right on the ground. The substance which I obtain from uranium is so concentrated that I can carry in my pocket all that will be required to repair the damage done to the transformers in the car. A careful examination, which I have made of the car, proves that the terrific shocks the machinery suffered in the crystal mountains caused an atomic readjustment which destroyed the usefulness of the material in the transformers, and while I might, by laboratory treatment, possibly restore its properties, I think it safer to obtain an entirely fresh supply. We shall start with the queen's ship within a few hours; so you had better make your preparations at once."    CHAPTER XV   AT THE MERCY OF FEARFUL ENEMIES  If we could have foreseen what was to happen during this trip, even Edmund, I believe, would have shrunk from undertaking it. But we all embarked upon it gladly, because we had conceived the highest expectations of the delight that it would afford us; and at the news that we were to visit mines of gold richer than any on the earth, Henry exhibited the first enthusiasm that he had shown since our departure from home.  Embarked on Ala's splendid "yacht," as Jack called it, and attended by her usual companions, we rapidly left the city behind, and sped away toward the purple mountains, so often seen in the distance. The voyage was a long one, but at length we drew near the foothills, and beheld the mountains towering into peaks behind. Lofty as they looked, there was no snow on their summits. We now descended where plumes of smoke had for some time attracted our attention, and found ourselves at one of the mines. It was a gold mine. The processes of extracting the ore, separating the metal, etc., were conducted with remarkable silence, but they showed a knowledge of metallurgy that would have amazed us if we had not already seen so much of the capacity of this people. Yet similarly to the scene in the library, its earth-likeness was startling.  "This sort of thing is uncanny," said Jack, as we were led through the works. "It makes me creep to see them doing things just as we do them at home, except that they are so quiet about it. If everything was different from our ways it would seem more natural."  "Anyhow," I replied, "we may take it as a great compliment to ourselves, for it shows that we have found out ways of doing things which cannot be improved even in Venus."  I should like to describe in detail the wonders of this mine, but I have space for only a few words about it. It was, Edmund learned, the richest on the planet, and was the exclusive property of the government, furnishing the larger part of its revenues, which were not comparable with those of a great terrestrial nation because of the absence of all the expenditures required by war. No fleets and no armies existed here, and no tariffs were needed where commerce was free. This great mine was the Laurium of Venus. The display of gold in the vaults connected with it exceeded a hundredfold all that the most imaginative historian has ever written of the treasures of Montezuma and Atahualpa. Henry's eyes fairly shone as he gazed upon it, and he could not help saying to Edmund:  "You might have had riches equal to this if you had stayed at home and developed your discovery."  Edmund contemptuously shrugged his shoulders, and turned away without a word.  We were afterwards conducted to a silver mine, which we also inspected, and finally to a lead mine in another part of the hills. This was in reality the goal at which Edmund had been aiming, for he had told us that uranium was sometimes found in association with lead. Our joy was very great when, after a long inspection, he informed us that he had discovered uranium, and that it now remained only to submit it to certain operations in a laboratory in order to prepare the substance that was to give renewed life to those lilliputian monsters in the car, which fed upon men's breath and begot power illimitable.  "I must now contrive," said Edmund, "to get admission to the laboratory connected with the mine, and to do my work without letting them suspect what I am about."  He managed it somehow, as he managed all things that he undertook, and within forty-eight hours after our arrival he was hard at work, evidently exciting the admiration of the native chemists by the knowledge and skill which he displayed. At first they crowded around him so that he was hampered in his efforts to conceal the real object of his labors; but at last they left him comparatively alone, and I could see by his expression whenever I visited the laboratory that things were going to his liking. But the work was long and delicate. Edmund had to fabricate secretly some of the chemical apparatus he needed, destroying it as fast as it served its purpose, so that weeks of time rolled by before he had what he called the "thimbleful of omnipotence" that was to make us masters of our fate. As fast as he produced it he put it in a metal box, shaped like a snuffbox, and covertly he showed it to us. It consisted of brilliant black grains, finer than millet seeds.  "Every one of those minute grains," he told us, "is packed with as much potential energy as that of a ton's weight suspended a mile above the earth."  But while the little box was being gradually filled with crystallized powder, we, who could lend no aid in the fabrication of Edmund's miracle, improved the opportunity to make acquaintance with the beauties of the surrounding country. Ala had returned to the capital, leaving an air ship at our disposal, and, of all persons in the world, _Ingra in command_! We refused all invitations to accompany him in the air ship, preferring to make our excursions on foot, accompanied at first by some of the attendants that Ala had left. Edmund did not share our fears that Ingra meditated mischief.  "He doesn't dare," was his reply to all our representations. But nothing could induce Jack and me to trust to Ingra's tender mercies.  Among the favorite spots which we had found to visit in the neighborhood of the mine was a little knoll crowned with a group of the most beautiful trees that I ever saw, and washed at its base by a brook of exquisitely transparent water which tinkled over a bed of white and clear-yellow pebbles, sparkling like jewels. More than once at the beginning I fished some of them out in the belief that they were nuggets of pure gold polished by the water. In a pool under the translucent shadow of the overhanging trees played small fish so splendid in their varied hues that they looked like miniature rainbows darting about beneath the water. Birds of vivid color sometimes flitted among the branches overhead. There was but one "rainy day" while we were at the mine; all the rest of the time not a cloud appeared under the great dome, and a scented zephyr continually drew down from the mountains and fanned us. Here, then, we passed many hours and many days, chatting of our adventures and our chances, drowsily happy in the pure physical enjoyment which this charming spot afforded.  When at last Edmund informed us that his box was full, and he was ready to return to the capital, we would not let him go without first conducting him to our little paradise. All together, then, with the exception of Juba, who, by some interference of an overlooking providence, was left at the mine, we set out in the highest spirits to be for once our leader's leaders in the exploration of some of the charms of Venus. Edmund was no less delighted than we had been with the place, and yielding to its somnolent influences we were soon stretched side by side on the spreading roots of a giant tree, and sleeping the sleep of sensuous languor.  Our waking was as terrible as it was sudden. I heard a cry, and at the same instant felt an irresistible hand grasping me by the throat. As I opened my eyes I saw that the whole party were prisoners. Nearby an air ship was quivering, as, held in leash, it lightly touched the ground; and a dozen gigantic fellows, whipping our hands behind our backs, hurried us aboard, the great mechanical bird, which instantly rose, describing a circle that carried us above the treetops. I did not try to struggle, for I felt how vain would be any effort that I could make.  Glancing about me, the very first features I recognized were those of Ingra. At last he had us in his power!  I looked at Edmund, but his face was set in thought, and he did not return my glance. Henry, as usual, had plunged into silent hopelessness, and Jack was a picture of mingled rage and despair. Although we were loosely fastened side by side to a rail on the deck, neither of us spoke for perhaps half an hour. In the meantime the air ship rose to a height greater than that of the nearby mountains, and then more slowly approached them. At last it began to circle, as if an uncertainty concerning the route to be chosen had arisen, and I observed, for we could look all about in spite of our bonds, that Ingra and one who appeared to be his lieutenant were engaged in an animated discussion. They pointed this way and that, and the debate grew every moment more earnest. This continued for a long time, while the ship hovered, running slowly in the wide circles. We could not then know how much this hesitation meant for us. If Ingra had been as rapid in his decision now as he was in the act of taking us prisoners, this history would never have been written. I watched Edmund, and saw that his attention was absorbed by what our captors were about, and even in that emergency I felt a touch of comfort through my unfailing confidence in our leader.  Finally a decision seemed to have been reached, and we set off over the crest of the range. As its huge peaks towered behind us and we descended nearer the ground, my heart sank again, for now we were cut off from the world beyond, and in the improbable event of any pursuit, how could the pursuers know what course we had taken, or where to look for us? And, then, who would pursue? Juba could do nothing, Ala was far away at the capital, even supposing that she should be disposed to set out in search of us, and hours, perhaps days, must elapse before she could be informed of what had happened. Not even when Jack and I were in the dungeon had our case seemed so desperate.  But how the gods repent when they have sunk men in the blackest pit of despair, sending them a messenger of hope to steady their hearts!  Good fortune had willed that we should be so placed upon the deck that we faced most easily sternward. Suddenly, as I gazed despondently at the serrated horizon receding in the distance, a thrill ran through my nerves at the sight of a dark speck in the sky, which seemed to float over one of the highest peaks. A second look assured me that it was moving; a third gave birth to the wild thought that it was in chase. Then I turned to Edmund and whispered:  "There is something coming behind us."  "Very well, do nothing to attract attention," he returned. "I have seen it. They are following us."  I said nothing to Jack or Henry, who had not yet caught sight of the object; but I could not withdraw my eyes from it. Sometimes I persuaded myself that it was growing larger, and then, with the intensity of my gaze, it blurred and seemed to fade. At last Jack spied it, and instantly, in his impetuous way, he exclaimed:  "Edmund! Look there!"  His voice drew Ingra's attention, and immediately the latter observed the direction of our glances, and himself saw the growing speck. He turned with flushed face to his lieutenant and in a trice the vessel began fairly to leap through the air.  "Ah, Jack," said Edmund reproachfully, but yet kindly, "if only you could always think before you speak! It is certain from Ingra's alarm that we are pursued by somebody whom he does not wish to meet. Most likely it is the queen, although it seems impossible that she could so quickly have learned of our mishap. Peter and I have been watching that object, which is unquestionably an air ship, in silence for the last twenty minutes, during which it has perceptibly gained upon us. But for your lack of caution it might have come within winning distance before it was discovered by Ingra, but now--"  The rebuke was deserved, perhaps, but yet I wished that Edmund had not given it, so painful was the impression that it made upon Jack's generous heart. His countenance was convulsed, and a tear rolled down his cheek--all the more pitiful to see because his arms were pinioned, and he could do nothing to conceal his agitation. Edmund was stricken with remorse when he saw the effect of his words.  "Jack," he said, "forgive me; I am sorry from the bottom of my heart. I should not have blamed you for a little oversight, when I alone am to blame for the misfortunes of us all."  "All right, Edmund, all right," returned Jack in his usual cheerful tones. "But, see here, I don't admit that you are to blame for anything. We're all in this boat together and hanged if we won't get out of it together, too, and you'll be the man to fetch us out."  Edmund smiled sadly, and shook his head.  Meanwhile Ingra, with the evident intention of concealing the movements of the vessel, dropped her so low that we hardly skipped the tops of the trees that we were passing over, for now we had entered a wide region of unbroken forest. Still that black dot followed straight in our wake, and I easily persuaded myself that it was yet growing larger. Edmund declared that I was right, and expressed his surprise, for we were now flying at the greatest speed that could be coaxed out of the motors. Suddenly a shocking thought crossed my mind. I tried to banish it, fearing that Ingra might read it in my eyes, and act upon it. Suppose that he should hurl us overboard! It was in his power to do so, and it seemed a quick and final solution. But he showed no intention to do anything of the kind. He may have had good reasons for refraining, but, at the time I could only ascribe his failure to take a summary way out of his difficulty to a protecting hand which guarded us even in this extremity.  On we rushed through the humming air, and still the pursuing speck chased us. And minute by minute it became more distinct against the background of the great cloud dome. Presently Edmund called our attention to something ahead.  "There," he said, "is Ingra's hope and our despair."  I turned my head and saw that in front the sky was very dark. Vast clouds seemed to be rolling up and obscuring the dome. Already there was a twilight gloom gathering about us.  "This," said Edmund, "is apparently the edge of what we may call the temperate zone, which must be very narrow, surrounding in a circle the great central region that lies under the almost vertical sun. The clouds ahead indicate the location of a belt of contending air currents, resembling that which we crossed after floating out of the crystal mountains. Having entered them, we shall be behind a curtain where our enemy can work his will with us."  Was it knowledge of this fact which had restrained Ingra from throwing us overboard? Was he meditating for us a more dreadful fate?  It was, indeed, a land of shadow which we now began to enter, and we could see that ahead of us the general inclination of the ground was downward. I eagerly glanced back to see if the pursuers were yet in sight. Yes! There was the speck, grown so large now that there could be no doubt that it was an air ship, driven at its highest speed. But we had entered so far under the curtain that the greater part of the dome was concealed, the inky clouds hanging like a penthouse roof far behind. We could plainly perceive the chasers; but could they see us? I tried to hope that they could, but reason was against it. Still they were evidently holding the course.  But even this hope faded when Ingra cunningly changed our course, turning abruptly to the left in the gloom. He knew, then, that we were invisible to the pursuers. But not content with one change, he doubled like a hunted fox. We watched for the effect of these maneuvers upon those behind us, and to our intense disappointment, though not to our surprise, we saw that they were continuing straight ahead. They surely could not have seen us, and even if they anticipated Ingra's ruse, how could they baffle it, and find our track again? At last the spreading darkness swallowed up the arc of illuminated sky behind, and then we were alone in the gloom.  This, you will understand, was not the deep night of the other side of the planet; it was rather a dusky twilight, and as our eyes became accustomed to it, we could begin to discern something of the character of our surroundings. We flew within a hundred yards of the ground, which appeared to be perfectly flat, and soon we were convinced by the pitchy-black patches which frequently interrupted the continuity of the umbrageous surface beneath, that it was sprinkled with small bodies of water--in short, a gigantic Dismal Swamp, or Everglade. I need hardly say that it was Edmund who first drew this inference, and when its full meaning burst upon my mind I shuddered at the hellish design which Ingra evidently entertained. Plainly, he meant to throw us into the morass, either to drown in the foul water, whose miasma now assailed our nostrils, or to starve amidst the fens! But his real intention, as you will perceive in a little while, was yet more diabolical.  The bird ship stooped lower, just skimming the tops of strange trees, the most horrible vegetable forms that I have ever beheld. And then, without warning, we were seized and pushed overboard, while the vessel, making a broad swoop, quickly disappeared. Henry alone uttered a loud cry as we fell.  We crashed through the clammy branches and landed close together in a swamp. Fortunately the water was not deep, and we were able to struggle upon our feet and make our way to a comparatively dry open place, perhaps half an acre in extent. No sooner were we all safe on the land than I noticed Edmund struggling violently and then he exclaimed:  "Here, quick! Hold a hand here!"  As he spoke he backed up to me.  "Take a match from this box which I have twisted out of my pocket, and while I hold the box, scratch it, and hold the flame against the bonds around my wrists."  I managed to get out a match, and scratched it. But the match broke. Edmund, with the skill of a prestidigitator, got out another match, and pushed it into my fingers. It failed again.  "It's got to be done!" he said. "Here, Jack, you try."  Again he extracted a match, as Jack backed up in my place. Whether his hands happened to be less tightly bound, or whether luck favored him, Jack, on a second attempt, succeeded in illuminating a match.  "Don't lose it," urged Edmund, as the light flashed out; "burn the cord."  Jack tried. The smell of burning flesh arose, but Edmund did not wince. In a few seconds the match went out.  "Another!" said Edmund, and the operation was repeated. A dozen separate attempts of this kind had been made, and I believe that I felt the pain inflicted by them more than Edmund did, when, making a tremendous effort, he burst the charred cord. His hands and wrists must have been fearfully burned, but he paid no attention to that. In a flash he had out his knife and cut us all loose. It was a mercy that they had not noticed the flame of the matches from the air ship, for if they had, unquestionably Ingra would have returned and made an end of us.  After our release we stood a few moments in silence, awaiting our leader's next move. Presently a sonorous sign startled us, followed by a sticky, tramping sound.  "In God's name, what's that?" exclaimed Jack.  [Illustration: "It curled itself over the edge of the hovering air ship and drew it down."]  "We'll see," said Edmund quietly, and threw open his pocket lantern.  As the light streamed out there was a rustle in the branches above us, and the form of an air ship pushed into view.  Ingra!  No, it was not Ingra! Thank God, there was the bushy head of Juba visible on the deck as the ship drifted over us! And near him stood Ala and a half dozen attendants.  As one man we shouted, but the sound had not ceased to echo when, out of the horrible tangle about us, rose, with a swift, sinuous motion, a monstrous anacondalike arm, flesh pink in the electric beam, but covered with spike-edged spiracles! It curled itself over the edge of the hovering air ship and drew it down.    CHAPTER XVI   DREADFUL CREATURES OF THE GLOOM  The deck of the air ship was tipped up at an angle of forty-five degrees by the pressure, and with inarticulate cries most of those on board tumbled off, some falling into the water and some disappearing amidst the tangled vegetation. Ala was visible, as the machine sank lower, and crashed through the branches, clinging to an upright on the sloping deck, while Juba, who hung on like a huge baboon, was helping her to maintain her place.  Almost at the same moment I caught sight of the head of the monstrous animal which had caused the disaster. It was as massive as that of an elephant or mammoth; and the awful arm resembled a trunk, but was of incredible size. Moreover, it was covered with sucking mouths or disks. The creature apparently had four eyes ranged round the conical front of the head where it tapered into the trunk, and two of these were visible, huge, green, and deadly bright in the gleam of the lantern.  For a moment we all stood as if petrified; then the great arm was thrown with a movement quick as lightning round both Ala and Juba as they clung to the upright! My heart shot into my mouth, but before the animal could haul in its prey, a series of terrific reports rattled like the discharge of a machine gun at my ear. The monstrous arm released the victims, and waved in agony, breaking the thick, clammy branches of the vegetation, and the vast head disappeared. Edmund had fired all the ten shots in his automatic pistol with a single pressure of the double trigger and an unvarying aim, directed, no doubt, at one of the creature's eyes.  "Quick!" he shouted, as the air ship, relieved from the stress, righted itself; "climb aboard."  The vessel had sunk so low, and the vegetation was so crowded about it, that we had no great difficulty in obeying his commands. He was the last aboard, and instantly he grasped the controlling apparatus, and we rose out of the tangle. We could hear the wounded monster thrashing in the swamp, but saw only the reflection of its movements in the commotion of the branches.  I had expected that Edmund would immediately fly at top speed away from the dreadful place, but, instead, as soon as we were at a safe elevation, he brought the air ship to a hover, circling slowly above the comparatively open spot of dry ground at the edge of the swamp.  "We cannot leave the poor fellows who have fallen overboard," he said, as quietly as if he had been safely aboard his own car. "We must stay here and find them."  Soon their cries came to our ears, and turning down the light of the lantern we saw five of them collected together on the solid ground, and gesticulating to us in an agony of terror. Edmund swept the ship around until we were directly over the poor fellows, and then allowed it to settle until it rested on the ground beside them. I trembled with apprehension at this bold maneuver, but Edmund was as steady as a rock. Ala instantly comprehended his intention, and encouraged her followers, who were all but paralyzed with fright, to clamber aboard. A momentary communication of the eyes took place between Edmund and Ala, and I understood that he was demanding if all had been found.  There was another--and not a trace of him could be seen.  "We must wait a moment," said Edmund, reloading the chamber of his pistol while he spoke. "I'll look about for him."  "In God's name, Edmund! You don't think of going down there!"  "But I do," he said firmly, and before I could put my hand on his arm he had dropped from the deck. The gigantic creature that he had wounded was still thrashing about a little distance off, occasionally making horrible sounds, but Edmund seemed to have no fear. We saw him, with amazement, walk collectedly round the ground encircled by the swamp, peering into the tangle, and frequently uttering a call. But his search was vain, and after five minutes of the most intense nervous strain that I ever endured, I thanked Heaven for seeing him return in safety, and come slowly aboard. There was another consultation with Ala, which evidently related to the ability of the engineer of the ship to resume his functions. This had a satisfactory result, for the fellow took his place, and the vessel finally quitted the ground. But, at Edmund's request, it rose only to a moderate height, and then began again to circle about. He would not yet give up the search.  We flew in widening circles, Edmund keeping his lantern directed toward the ground, and the full horror of these interminable morasses now became plain. I was in a continual shudder at the evidence of Ingra's pitiless scheme for our destruction. He had meant that we should be the prey of the unspeakable inhabitants of the fens, and had believed that there was no possibility of escape from them. We became aware that there was a great variety of them in the swamps and thickets beneath through the noises that they made--heart-quaking cries, squealing sounds, gruntings, and, most trying of all, a loud, piercing whistle whose sibilant pulsations penetrated the ear like thrusts of a needle. I pictured to myself a colossal serpent as the most probable author of this terrifying sound, but the error of my fancy was demonstrated by a tragedy which shook even Edmund's iron nerves.  Always circling, and always watching what was below by the light of the lantern, which was of extraordinary power for so small an instrument, we saw occasionally a curling trunk uplifted above the vegetation, as if its owner imagined that the strange light playing on the branches was some delicate prey that could be grasped, and sometimes a gliding form whose details escaped detection, when, upon passing over a relatively open place, like that where our adventure had occurred, a blood-curdling sight met our eyes.  Directly ahead, in the focus of the reflector of the lantern, and not more than a hundred feet distant, stood a prodigious black creature, on eight legs, rolling something in its mandibles, which were held close to what seemed to be its mouth.  "Good Lord!" cried Jack. "It's a tarantula as big as a buffalo!"  "It has caught the missing man!" said Edmund. "Look!"  He pointed to a shred of garment dangling on a thorny branch. I felt sick at heart, and I heard a groan from Jack. After all, these people were like us, and our feelings would not have been more keenly agitated if the victim had been a descendant of Adam.  "He is beyond all help," I faltered.  "But he can be avenged," said Edmund, in a tone that I had never heard him use before.  As he spoke he whipped out his pistol, and crash! crash! crash! sounded the hurrying shots. As their echo ceased, the giant arachnid dropped his prey, and then there came from him--clear, piercing, quivering through our nerves--that arrowy whistle that had caused us to shudder as we unwillingly listened to it darting out of the gloom of the impenetrable thickets.  Then, to our horror, the creature, which, if touched at all by the shots, had not been seriously injured, picked up its prey and bounded away in the darkness. Edmund instantly turned to Ala, and I knew as well as if he had spoken, what his demand was. He wished to follow, and his wish was obeyed. We swooped ahead, and in a minute we saw the creature again. It had stopped on another oasis of dry land, and it still carried its dreadful burden. Its head was toward us, and it appeared to be watching our movements. Its battery of eyes glittered wickedly, and I noticed the bristle of stiff hairs, like wires, that covered its body and legs.  Again Edmund fired upon it, and again it uttered its stridulous pipe of defiance, or fear, and leaped away in the tangle. We sped in pursuit, and when we came upon it for the third time it had stopped in an opening so narrow that the bow of the air ship almost touched it before we were aware of its presence. This time its prey was no longer visible. There was no question now that its attitude meant defiance. Cold shivers ran all over me as, with fascinated eyes, I gazed at its dreadful form. It seemed to be gathering itself for a spring, and I shrank away in terror.  Crash! bang! bang! bang! sounded the shots once more, and in the midst of them there came a blinding tangle of bristled, jointed legs that thrashed the deck, a thud that shook the air ship to its center, and a cry from Jack, who fell on his back with a crimson line across his face.  "Give me your pistol!" shouted Edmund, snatching my arm.  I hardly know how I got it out of my pocket, I was so unnerved, but it was no sooner in Edmund's hand than he was leaning over the side of the deck and pouring out the shots. When the pistol was emptied he straightened up, and said simply:  "_That_ devil is ended."  Then he turned to where Jack lay on the deck. We all bent over him with anxious hearts, even Ala sharing our solicitude. He had lost his senses, but a drop from Edmund's flask immediately brought him round, and he rose to his feet.  "I'm all right," he said, with a rather sickly smile; "but," drawing his hand across his brow and cheek, "he got me here, and I thought it was a hot iron. Where is he now?"  "Dead," said Edmund.  "Jo, I'd have liked to finish him myself!"  We were worried by the appearance of the wound, like a long, deep scratch, on Jack's face, but, of course, we said nothing about our worriment to him. Edmund bound it up, as best he could, and it afterwards healed, but it took a long time about it, and left a mark that never disappeared. There was probably a little poison in it.  Edmund himself needed the attention of a surgeon, for his wrists had been cruelly burned by the matches, but he would not allow us to speak of his sufferings, and putting on some slight bandages, he declared that it was time now to get out of this wilderness of horrors. He communicated with Ala, and in a few minutes we were speeding, at a high elevation, toward the land of the opaline dome. So far above the morasses we no longer heard the brute voices of its terrible inhabitants, nor saw the swaying of the branches as they looked about in search of prey.  "This," said Edmund, "exceeds everything that I could have imagined. I do not know in what classification to put any of the strange beasts that we have seen. They can only be likened to the monsters of the early dawn on the earth, in the age of the dinosaurs. But they are _sui generis_, and would make our anatomists and paleontologists stare. I am only surprised that we have encountered no flying dragons here."  "But was it really a--a giant spider that captured Ala's man?" I asked with a shudder.  "God knows what it was! It had the form of a spider, and it leaped like one. If it had been armored I could never have killed it. I think the shock of its impact against the air ship helped to finish it."  It was only after we had issued from under the curtain of twilight that we learned the story of the chase which had brought our salvation. Edmund first obtained it from Ala and Juba, filling out the outlines of their wordless narrative with his ready power of interpretation, and then he told it to us."  "We owe our lives to Juba," he said. "Ala had just returned to the mine from the capital when our abduction took place. Juba, who had wandered out on our track, saw from a distance the seizure, and a few minutes afterwards Ala's air ship arrived. He instantly communicated the facts to her, and without losing an instant the chase was begun. Ingra's delay in choosing his course was the thing that saved us. They knew that they must not lose sight of us for an instant, and their motors were driven to their highest capacity. Fortunately, Ala's vessel is one of the speediest, and they were able to gain on us from the start. Slowly they drew up until the border of the twilight zone was reached. Then as we entered under the clouds we were swallowed from the sight of all except Juba. But for his wonderful eyes, there would have been no hope of continuing the chase. He had lived all his life in a land of darkness and now he began to feel himself at home. Throwing off the shades which he has worn since our arrival, he had no difficulty in following the movements of Ingra, even after our vessel had completely faded from the view of all the others. So, without abating their fearful speed, they plunged into the gloom straight upon our track. The nose of the bloodhound is not more certain in the chase than were Juba's eyes in that terrible flight through the darkness. When Ingra changed his course and doubled, Juba saw the maneuver and turned the dodge against its inventor, for now Ingra could not see them, and did not know that they were still on his track. They cut off the corners, and gained so rapidly that they were close at hand when Ingra rose from the swamp after pitching us overboard. They had heard Henry's cry, which served to tell them what had happened, and to direct them to the spot. But even Juba could not discern us in the midst of the vegetation, and it was the sudden flashing out of our lamp which revealed our location when they were about to pass directly over us."  I need not say with what breathless attention we listened to this remarkable story, which Edmund's scientific imagination had constructed out of the bones of fact that he had been able to gather.  "Jo," said Jack, "our luck is simply outlandish!"  Then he broke out in one of his fits of enthusiasm. Slapping Juba on the shoulder, he danced around him, laughing joyously, and exclaiming:  "Bully old boy! Oh, you're a trump! Wait till I get you in New York, and I'll give you the time of your life! Eh, Edmund, won't we make him a member of Olympus? Golly, won't he make a sensation!"  And Jack hugged himself again with delight. His reference to home threw us into a musing. At length I asked:  "Shall we ever see the earth again, Edmund?"  "Why, of course we shall," he replied heartily. "I have the material I need, and it only remains to repair the car. I shall set about it the moment we reach the capital. Do you know," he continued, "this adventure has undoubtedly been a benefit to us."  "How so?"  "By increasing our prestige. They have seen the terrible power of the pistols. They have seen us conquer monsters that they must have regarded as invincible. When they see what the car can do, even Ingra will begin to fear us, and to think that we are more than mortal."  "But what will Ala think of Ingra now?"  "Ah, I cannot tell; but, at any rate, he cannot have strengthened himself in her regard, for it is plain that she, at least, has no desire to see us come to harm. But he is a terrible enemy still, and we must continue to be on our guard against him."  "I should think that he would hardly dare to show himself now," I remarked.  "Don't be too sure of that. After all, we are interlopers here, and he has all the advantages of his race and his high rank. Ala is interested in us because she has, I believe I may say, a philosophical mind, with a great liking for scientific knowledge. It was she who planned and personally conducted the expedition toward the dark hemisphere. From me she has learned a little. She appreciates our knowledge and our powers, and would ask nothing better than to learn more about us and from us. Her prompt pursuit and interference to save us when she must have understood, perfectly, Ingra's design, shows that she will go far to protect us; but we must not presume too much on her ability to continue her protection, nor even on her unvarying disposition to do so. For the present, however, I think that we are safe, and I repeat that our position has been strengthened. Ingra made a great mistake. He should have finished us out of hand."  "His leaving us to be devoured by those fearful creatures showed an inexplicable cruelty on his part; he chose the most horrible death he could think of for us," I said.  "Oh, I don't know," replied Edmund. "Did you ever see a laughing boy throw flies into a spider's den? It is my idea that he simply wished to have us disappear mysteriously, and then _he_ would never have offered an explanation, unless it might have been the malicious suggestion that we had suddenly decamped to return to the world we pretended to have come from. And but for Ala's unexpected return to the mine he would have succeeded. No doubt his crew were pledged to secrecy."    CHAPTER XVII   EARTH MAGIC ON VENUS  We were no sooner installed again at the capital than Edmund began his "readjustment of the atomic energies."  "Blessed if I know what he means," said Jack; "but he gets the goods, and that's enough for me."  In reality I did not understand it any better than Jack did, only I had more knowledge than he of the nature of the forces that Edmund employed. We went with him to the place in the great tower where the car had been stored, and where it seemed to be regarded with a good deal of superstitious awe. But they had not yet the least idea of its marvelous powers. We were preparing for them the greatest surprise of their lives, and our impatience to see the effect that would be produced when we made our first flight grew by day, while Edmund, shut up alone in the car, labored away at his task.  "I wonder what they think he is doing in there," I said, the third day after our return, as we sat on a balcony of the floating tower, with our feet nonchalantly elevated on a railing, and our eyes drinking in the magnificent prospect of the vast city, as brilliant in variegated colors as a flower garden, while a soft breeze, that gently swayed the gigantic gossamer, soothed us like a perfumed fan.  "Worshipping the sun god, I reckon," laughed Jack. "But, see here, Peter, what do you make of this religion of theirs, anyway?"  "I don't know what to make of it," I replied. "But if the sun really does appear to them once in a lifetime, or so, as Edmund thinks, it seems to me natural enough that they should worship it. We have done more surprising things of the kind on the earth."  "Not civilized people like these."  "Oh, yes. The Egyptians were civilized, and the Romans, and they worshipped all sorts of strange things that struck their fancy. And what can you say to the Greeks--they were civilized enough, and look what a collection of gods they had."  "But the wise heads among them didn't really believe in their gods."  "I'm not sure of that; at any rate they had to pretend that they believed. No doubt there were some who secretly scoffed at the popular belief, and it may be the same here. I shouldn't wonder if Ingra were one of the scoffers. Edmund has a great opinion of his intelligence, and if he really doesn't believe in the thing, he is all the more dangerous for us, because you know that now we are depending a good deal on their superstition for our safety."  "But Ala is very intelligent, a regular wonder, I should think, from what Edmund says; and yet she accepts their superstition as gospel."  "Lucky for us that she does believe," I said. "But there's some great mystery behind all this; Edmund has convinced me of that. We don't begin to understand it yet, and there are moments when I think that Edmund is afraid of the whole thing. He seems dimly to foresee some catastrophe connected with it, though what it may be I cannot imagine, and I think he doesn't know himself."  Henry listened to our conversation without proffering a remark--quite the regular thing with him--and at this point Jack, yielding to the overpowering sense of well-being, and the soothing influence of the delicious air and delightful view, closed his eyes for a nap.  Presently Edmund came and roused us all up with the remark that he had finished his work. Jack was instantly on his feet:  "Hurrah!" he exclaimed. "Now for another trip that will open the eyes of these Venusians. Where shall we go, Edmund?"  "We shall go nowhere just at present. I want first to make sure by a trial trip that everything is in perfect shape. For that purpose I shall wait for the hours of repose when there will be nobody to watch us."  I must here explain more fully what I have already said--that in this land of unceasing daylight, everybody took repose as regularly as on the earth. That is a necessity for all physical organisms. When they slept, they retired into darkened chambers, and passed several hours in peaceful slumber. We had learned the time when this periodical need for sleep seized upon the entire population, and although, naturally, there were a few wide-awakes who kept "late hours," yet within a certain time after the habitual hour for repose had arrived it was a rare thing to see anybody stirring. We had, then, only to wait until "the solemn dead of night" came on in order that Edmund might try his experiment with almost a certainty of not being observed. This was the easier, since latterly there had been no guard kept over our movements. We were not confined in any way, and could go and come as we pleased. Evidently, if anybody thought of such a thing as an attempt to escape on our part, they trusted to the fact that we had no means of getting away, for after our first exploit of that kind, all the air ships were carefully guarded, and placed beyond our reach. As to the car, there was nothing about it to suggest that it could fly, and probably they took it simply for some kind of boat, since they had seen us employ it only in navigating the sea. I have often thought, with wonder, of their unsuspiciousness in permitting Edmund to spend so much time alone and undisturbed in the car. Possibly, there was something in Jack's suggestion, that they supposed it to be connected with our religious observances. Anyhow, so it was; and I can only ascribe the fact to the kindness of that overlooking Power which so often interfered in our behalf, making it no disparagement of our claim upon its protection that we had abandoned our mother earth and ventured so far away into space!  One thing decidedly in our favor was that, since our return from the mine (the adventure in the land of bogs and monsters was, as far as Edmund could ascertain, unknown at the capital, except by those who had taken part in it), we had been accustomed to pass the hours of repose in the tower. We should thus be close to the car when we got ready to start. Another equally favorable circumstance--and perhaps it was even more important--was the absence of Ingra, who, either because he did not care just now to face Ala, or because he had gone off somewhere after throwing us to the animals and was not yet aware of our escape, had not shown himself. If he had been present it might not have been so easy for Edmund to make his preparations.  Never had the great city seemed to me so long in quieting down for its periodical rest as on this occasion. After all was deserted in the streets below, people were still moving about on the tower, and it did seem as if they had taken a fit of wakefulness expressly to annoy us and interfere with our plans. We kept stealing out of our sleeping room, and looking cautiously about, for at least two hours, but always there was some one stirring in the immediate neighborhood. At last a tall fellow, who had been standing an interminable time at the rail directly in front of the storage place of the car, and whom Jack had half seriously threatened to throttle if he stood there any longer, turned and went yawning away. No sooner was he out of sight than Edmund led the way, and with the slightest possible noise, aided by Juba, who was as strong as three men, we got the car out on the platform. I was in a fever lest there should be a squeak from the little wheels that carried it. But they ran as still as rubber.  "Get in," whispered Edmund; and we obeyed him with alacrity.  Would it go?  Even Edmund could not answer that question. He pulled a knob, and I held my breath. There was the slightest perceptible tremor. Was it going to balk? No, thank Heaven! It was under way. In a few seconds we were off the tower in the free air. Edmund pressed a button, and the speed instantly increased. The gorgeous tower seemed to be flying away from us like a soap bubble. Jack, in ecstasy, could hardly repress a cheer.  "Hurrah, if you want to,"' said Edmund.  "They won't hear you, and now I don't care if they do. The apparatus is all right, and we'll give them something to wake up for. My only anxiety was lest they should witness a failure, which might have led to disagreeable consequences. There must be no dropping of knives in our juggling."  "Good!" cried Jack. "Then let's give 'em a salute."  Edmund smiled and nodded his head:  "The guns are in the locker," he said.  Jack had one of the automatic rifles out in a hurry.  "Shoot high," said Edmund, "and off toward the open country. The projectiles fly far, and I guess we can take the risk."  He threw both windows open, and Jack aimed skyward and began to pull the trigger.  Bang! bang! bang! Heavens, what a noise it was! The car must have seemed a flying volcano. And it woke them up! The sleeping city poured forth its millions to gaze and wonder. Surely they had never heard such a thundering. Within five minutes we saw them on the roofs and in the towers. Many were staring at us through a kind of opera glasses which they had. Then from a dozen aerial pavilions the colors broke forth and quivered through the air.  "Saluting us!" exclaimed Jack, delighted.  "Asking one another questions, rather," said Edmund.  They certainly asked enough of them, and I wondered what answers they returned.  "Probably they think we're off for good," said I.  "And aren't we?" asked Henry anxiously.  "Not yet," Edmund replied, and Henry's countenance fell.  The car turned and approached the great tower again. We swept round it within a hundred yards, and could see the amazement in the faces that watched us. But if they were astonished they were not terror-stricken. Within ten minutes twenty air ships were swiftly approaching us. Edmund allowed them to come within a few yards, and then darted away, rushed round the whole city like a flying cloud, and finally rose straight up with dizzying velocity, which made the vast metropolis shrink to a colored patch, as if we had been viewing it through the wrong end of a telescope.  "I'll go right up through the cloud dome now," he said. "Nothing could more impress them with a sense of our power than that; and when we come back again they will know that we have no fear, and the very act will be a proof of origin from the sky."  When we were in the midst of the mighty curtain of vapor, I was interested in noticing the peculiar quality of the light that surrounded us. We seemed to be immersed in a rose-pink mist.  "I do not understand," I said to Edmund, "how this dome is maintained at so great an elevation, and in apparent independence of the rain clouds which sometimes form beneath. No rain ever falls from the dome itself, and yet it consists of true clouds."  "I think," he replied, "that the dome is due to vapors which assemble at a general level of condensation, and do not form raindrops, partly because of the absence of dust to serve as nuclei at this great height, and partly because of some peculiar electrical condition of the air, arising from the relative nearness of Venus to the sun, which prevents the particles of vapor from gathering into drops heavy enough to fall. You will observe that there is a peculiar inner circulation in the vapor surrounding us, marked by ascending and descending currents which are doubtless limited by the upper and lower surfaces of the dome. The true rain clouds form in the space beneath the dome, where there seems to be an independent circulation of the winds."  On entering the cloud vault Edmund had closed the windows, explaining that it was not merely the humidity which led him to do so, but the diminishing density of the air which, when we had risen considerably above the dome, would become too rare for comfortable breathing. In a little while his conjecture about a peculiar electrical condition was justified by a pale-blue mist which seemed to fill the air in the car; but we felt no effects and the mechanism was not disturbed. Owing to our location on Venus, still at a long distance from the center of the sunward hemisphere, the sun was not directly overhead, but inclined at a large angle to the vertical, so that when we began to approach the upper surface of the vault, and the vapor thinned out, we saw through one of the windows a pulsating patch of light, growing every moment brighter and more distinct, until as we shot out of the clouds it instantly sharpened into a huge round disk of blinding brilliance.  "The sun! The sun!" we cried.  We had not seen it for months. When it had gleamed out for a short time during our drift across the water from the land of ice into the belt of tempests, we had been too much occupied with our safety to pay attention to it; but now the wonder of it awed us. Four times as large and four times as bright and hot as it appears from the earth, its rays seemed to smite with terrific energy. Juba, wearing his eye shades, shrank into a corner and hid his face.  "It is well that we are protected by the walls of the car and the thick glass windows," said Edmund, "for I do not doubt that there are solar radiations in abundance here which scarcely affect us on the earth, but which might prove dangerous or even mortal if we were exposed to their full force."  Even at the vast elevation which we had now attained there was still sufficient air to diffuse the sunlight, so that only a few of the brightest stars could be glimpsed. Below us the spectacle was magnificent and utterly unparalleled. There lay the immense convex shield of Venus, more dazzling than snow, and as soft in appearance as the finest wool. We gazed and gazed in silent admiration, until suddenly Henry, who had shown less enthusiasm over the view than the rest of us, said, in a doleful voice:  "And now that we are here--free, free, where we can do as we like--with all means at our command--oh! why will you return to that accursed planet? Edmund, in the name of God, I beseech you, go back to the earth! Go now! For the love of Heaven do not drag us into danger again! Go home! Oh, go home!"  The appeal was pitiful in its intensity of feeling, and a shade of hesitation appeared on Edmund's face. If it had been Jack or I, I believe that he would have yielded. But he slowly shook his head, saying in a sympathetic tone:  "I am sorry, Henry, that you feel that way. But I _cannot_ leave this planet yet. Have patience for a little while and then we will go home."  I doubt whether afterwards, Edmund himself did not regret that he had refused to grant Henry's prayer. If we had gone now when it was in our power to go without interference, we should have been spared the most tragic and heart-rending event of all that occurred during the course of our wandering. But Edmund seemed to feel the fascination of Venus as a moth feels that of the candle flame.  When we emerged again on the lower side of the dome we were directly over the capital. We had been out of view for at least three hours, but many were still gazing skyward, toward the point where the car had disappeared, and when we came into sight once more there were signs of the utmost agitation. The prismatic signals began to flash from tower to tower, conveying the news of the reappearance of the car, and as we drew near we saw the crowds reassembling on every point of vantage. We went out on the window ledges to watch the display.  "Perhaps they think that we have been paying a visit to the sun," I suggested.  "Well, if they do I shall not undeceive them," said Edmund, "although it goes against the grain to make any pretense of the kind. Ala, particularly, is so intelligent, and has so genuine a desire for knowledge, that if I could only cause her to comprehend the real truth it would afford me one of the greatest pleasures of my life."  "I hope old Beak Nose is getting his fill of this show," put in Jack. "He'll be likely to treat us with more respect after this. By the way, I wonder what's become of my money. I think I'll sue out a writ of replevin in the name of the sun to recover it."  Nobody replied to Jack's sally, and the car rapidly approached the great tower.  "Are you going to land there?" I asked.  "I certainly shall," Edmund responded with decision.  "But they'll seize the car!" exclaimed Henry in affright.  "No, they won't. They are too much afraid of it."  Any further discussion was prevented by a sight which arrested the eyes of all of us. On the principal landing of the tower, whence we had departed with the car, stood Ala with her suite, and by her side was Ingra!  His sudden apparition was a great surprise, as well as a great disappointment, for we had felt sure that he was not in the city, and I, at least, had persuaded myself that he might be in disgrace for his attempt on our lives. Yet here he was, apparently on terms of confidence with her whom we had regarded as our only sure friend.  "Hang him!" exclaimed Jack. "There he is! By Jo, if Edmund had only invented a noiseless gun of forty million atom power, I'd rid Venus of _him_, in the two-billionth part of a second!"  "Keep quiet," said Edmund, sternly, "and remember what I now tell you; in no way, by look or act, is any one of us to indicate to him the slightest resentment for what he did. Ignore him, as if you had never seen him."  By this time the car had nearly touched the landing. Edmund stepped inside a moment and brought it completely to rest, anchoring it, as he whispered to me, by "atomic attraction." When the throng on the tower saw the car stop dead still, just in contact with the landing, but manifestly supported by nothing but the air--no wings, no aeroplanes, no screws, no mechanism of any kind visible--there arose the first _voice of a crowd_ that we had heard on the planet. It fairly made me jump, so unexpected, and so contrary to all that we had hitherto observed, was the sound. And this multitudinous voice itself had a quality, or timbre, that was unlike any sound that had ever entered my ears. Thin, infantine, low, yet multiplied by so many mouths to a mighty volume, it was fearful to listen to. But it lasted only a moment; it was simply a universal ejaculation, extorted from this virtually speechless people by such a marvel as they had never dreamed of looking upon. But even this burst of astonishment, as Edmund afterwards pointed out, was really a tribute to their intelligence, since it showed that they had instantly appreciated both the absence of all mechanical means of supporting the car and the fact that here was something that implied a power infinitely exceeding any that they possessed. And to have produced in a world where aerial navigation was the common, everyday means of conveyance, such a sensation by a performance in the _air_ was an enormous triumph for us!  No sooner had we gathered at the door of the car to step out upon the platform than an extraordinary thing occurred. The front of the crowd receded into the form of a semicircle, of which the point where we stood marked the center, and in the middle of the curve, slightly in advance of the others, stood forth the tall form of the eagle-beaked high priest with the terrible face, flanked on one side by Ala and on the other by the Jovelike front of the aged judge before whom our first arraignment had taken place. Directly behind Ala stood Ingra. The contrast between the three principal personages struck my eye even in that moment of bewilderment--Ala stately, blonde, and beautiful as a statue of her own Venus; the high priest ominous and terrifying in aspect, even now when we felt that he was honoring us; and the great judge, with his snow-white hair and piercing eyes, looking like a god from Olympus.  "Do you note the significance of that arrangement?" Edmund asked, nudging me. "Ala, the queen, yields the place of honor to the high priest. That indicates that our reception is essentially a religious one, and proves that our flight sunward has had the expected effect. Now we have the head of the religious order on our side. Human nature, if I may use such a term, is the same in whatever world you find it. Touch the imagination with some marvel and you awaken superstition; arouse superstition and you can do what you like."  It would be idle for me to attempt to describe our reception because Edmund himself could only make shrewd guesses as to the meaning of what went on, and you would probably not be particularly interested in his conjectures. Suffice it to say that when it was over, we felt that, for a time at least, we were virtually masters of the situation.  Only one thing troubled my mind--what did Ingra think and what would he do? At any rate, he, too, for the time being, seemed to have been carried away with the general feeling of wonder, and narrowly as I watched him I could detect in his features no sign of a wish to renew his persecution.    CHAPTER XVIII   WILD EDEN  The next day after our return from the trip above the cloud dome, and our astonishing reception (you will, of course, understand the sense in which I use the term "day"), Edmund sprang another surprise upon us.  "I have persuaded Ala," he said, "to make a trip in the car."  "You don't mean it!"  "Oh, yes, and I am sure she will be delighted."  "But she is not going alone?"  "Surely no; she will be accompanied by one of her women--and by Ingra."  "_Ingra_!"  "Of course. Did you suppose that he would consent to be left behind? Ala herself would refuse to go without him."  "Then," I said, with deep disappointment, "he has resumed all his influence over her."  "I'm not sure he ever lost it," returned Edmund. "You forget his rank, and his position as her destined consort. Whatever we do we have got to count him in."  Jack raged inwardly, but said nothing. For my part, I almost wished Jack's bullet had not gone astray at that first memorable shooting.  "Now," Edmund continued, "the car, as you know, has but a limited amount of room. I do not wish to crowd it uncomfortably, but I can take six persons. Ala's party comprises three, so there is room for just two besides myself. You will have to draw lots."  "Is Juba included in the drawing?"  "Yes, and I'm half inclined to take him anyway, and let you three draw for the one place remaining."  "You can count me out," said Henry. "If there is another to stay with me I prefer to remain."  "Very well," said Edmund, "then Peter and Jack can draw lots."  "Since we can't all go," said Jack, "and since that fellow is to be of the party, I'll stay with Henry."  So it was settled without an appeal to chance, and I went with Edmund and Juba. As usual Edmund immediately put his project into execution. It showed an astonishing confidence in us that Ala should consent to make such a trip, and that her people, and especially Ingra, should assent to it, and I could not sufficiently wonder at the fact. But we were now at the summit of favor and influence, and it is impossible to guess what thoughts may have been in their minds. At any rate, it showed how completely Edmund had established himself in Ala's esteem, and I suspect that her woman's curiosity had played a large part in the decision. There was another thing which astonished me yet more, and, in fact, awakened a good deal of apprehension in my mind. I could not but wonder that Edmund, after all the precautions that he had previously taken, should now think of admitting these people into the car, where they could witness his manipulations of the mechanism. I spoke to him about it. "Rest your mind easy about that," he said. "Now that everything goes like a charm, they will suspect nothing. It will be all a complete mystery to them. Even the gods used natural agencies when they visited the earth without shaking the belief of mankind in them. I employ no force of which they have the least idea, and if they see me touch a button, or pull a knob, what can that convey to their minds except an impression of mysterious power?"  I said no more, but I was not convinced, and the sequel proved that, for once, Edmund had made a serious mistake, the more amazing because he had been the first to detect the exceptional intelligence and shrewdness of Ingra. But, no doubt, in the exultation of his recent triumph, he counted upon the strength of the superstitious regard in which we were held.  Our departure from the tower was the signal for the assembling of great crowds of spectators again, and we sailed away with the utmost _eclat_. Ala at once showed all the eager excitement of a child over so novel and enjoyable an experience. The motion of the car was entirely unlike that of the air ships. Perfectly steady, it skimmed along at a speed which filled her with amazement and delight. The city, with its towers, seemed to fly away from us by magic, and the trees and fields beneath ran into streaming lines. The windows were thrown wide open, and all stood by them, watching the scene. Finally Ala wished to go out on the window ledges, where one was perfectly secure if he kept a firm hold on the supports. Edmund was most of the time with us outside, only stepping within when he wished to change the course. I thought that he showed a disposition to conceal his manipulations as much as possible, as if what I had said had made an impression. But all were so much occupied with their novel sensations that, for the time at least, there was no danger of their taking note of anything else.  I believe that it must have been some intimation from Ala which finally led Edmund to hold his course toward the mountains, but in a direction different from that which led to the mines. When he had once chosen this direction he worked up the speed to fully a hundred miles an hour, and all were compelled to go inside on account of the wind created by our rush through the air. We held on thus for five hours. During this time Edmund spread a repast made up of dishes chosen from the supplies in the car, and, of course, utterly strange to our guests. They found them to their taste, however, and were delighted with Edmund's entertainment. We spent a long time at our little table, and I was surprised at the variety of delicious things which Edmund managed to extract from his stores. There was even some champagne, and I noticed that Edmund urged it upon Ingra, who, nothing loth, drank enough to make him decidedly tipsy, a fact which was not surprising since we had found that the wines of Venus were very light, and but slightly alcoholized.  At length we began to approach what proved to be the goal of our journey. Before us spread a vast extent of forest composed of trees of the most beautiful forms and foliage. Some towered up to a great height, spreading their pendulous branches over the less aspiring forms, like New England elms; others were low and bushy, and afire with scarlet blossoms, whose perfume filled the air; a few resembled gigantic grasses or great timothy stems, surmounted with nodding plumes of golden leaves, streaming out like gilt gonfalons in the breeze; but there was one species, as tall and massive as oaks, and scattered everywhere through the forest, that I could liken to nothing but enormous rose bushes in the full bloom of June. When we began to pass above this strange woodland, Ala made some communication to Edmund which caused him to slow down the movement of the car. By almost imperceptible touches he controlled the motive power, and presently we came to rest above a delightful glade, where a small stream ran at the foot of a gravelly slope, crowned with grass and overhung by trees.  Here the car was allowed to settle gently upon the ground, and all alighted. Ingra, over whom the influence of the champagne had been growing, tottered on his legs in a way that would have filled Jack with uncontrollable delight, but Edmund gravely helped him out of the car and steadied him to a seat on the soft turf under the tree. I saw Ala regarding Ingra with a puzzled look, and no wonder, for Edmund had been careful that no one else should take enough of the wine to produce more than the slightest exhilaration of spirits. It is possible that Edmund had plied Ingra with the idea of rendering him less observant, and it probably had that effect; but it resulted, as you will see presently, in a revelation which finally put Edmund on guard against the very danger to which he had seemed so insensible when I mentioned it to him before our start.  The place where we now were was, beyond comparison, the most charming that we had yet seen. A very Eden it seemed, wild, splendid, and remote from all cultivation. The air was loaded with indescribable fragrance shed from the thousands of strange blossoms that depended from trees and shrubs, and starred the rich grass. I learned afterwards from Edmund, who had it from Ala, that the spot was famous for its beauty and other attractions, and was sometimes visited in air ships from the capital. But for them, what took us but a few hours was a trip extending over several days of time. One would have said that the forest was imbedded in a garden of the most extraordinary orchids. The shapes of some of the flowers were so fantastic that it seemed impossible that Nature could have produced them. And their colors were no less unparalleled, inimitable, and incredible.  The flowery bank on which we had chosen our resting place was removed a few yards from the spot where the car rested, and the latter was hidden from view by intervening branches and huge racemes of gorgeous flowers, hanging like embroidered curtains about us. A peculiarity of the place was that little zephyr-like breezes seemed to haunt it, coming one could not tell whence, and they stirred the hanging blossoms, keeping them in almost continual rhythmic motion. The effect was wonderfully charming, but I observed that Ala was especially influenced by it. She sat with her maid beside her, and fixed her eyes, with an expression of ecstasy, upon the swinging flowers. I whispered to Edmund to regard her singular absorption. But he had already noticed it, and seemed to be puzzling his brain with thoughts that it suggested to him.  Thus as we sat, the leaves of a tree over our heads were lightly stirred, and a bird, adorned with long plumes more beautiful than those of a bird of paradise, alighted on a branch, and began to ruffle its iridescent feathers in a peculiar way. With every movement waves of color seemed to flow over it, merging and dissolving in the most marvelous manner. As soon as this bird appeared, Ala gave it all her attention, and the pleasure which she experienced in watching it was reflected upon her countenance. She seemed positively enraptured. After a few moments the conviction came to me that she was _listening!_ Her whole attitude expressed it. And yet not an audible sound came from the bird. At last I whispered to Edmund:  "Edmund, I believe that Ala hears something which we do not."  "Of course she does," was his reply. "There is music here, such music as was never heard on earth. That bird is _singing_, but our ears are not attuned to its strain. You know the peculiarity of this atmosphere with regard to sound, and that all of these people have a horror of loud noises. But their ears detect sounds which are beyond the range of the vibrations that affect ours. If you will observe the bird closely you will perceive that there is a slight movement of its throat. But that is not the greatest wonder, by any means. I am satisfied that there is _a direct relation here between sounds and colors_. The swaying of the flowers in the breeze and the rhythmic motion of the bird's plumage produce harmonious combinations and recombinations of colors which are transformed into sounds as exquisite as those of the world of insects. A cluster of blossoms, when the wind stirs them, shake out a kind of aeolian melody, and it was that which so entranced Ala a few moments ago. She hears it still, but now it is mastered by the more perfect harmonies that come from the bird, partly from its throat but more from the agitation of its delicate feathers."  You may imagine the wonder with which I listened to this. It immediately recalled what Jack and I had observed at the shop of the bird fancier, and when the lady carried off her seemingly mute pets in the palanquin.  "But," I said, after a moment of reflection, "how can such a thing be? To me it seems surely impossible."  "I can only try to explain it by an analogy," said Edmund. "You know how, by a telephone, sounds are first transmuted into electric vibrations and afterwards reshaped into sonorous waves. You know, also, that we have used a ray of light to send telephonic messages, through the sensitiveness of a certain metal which changes its electric resistance in accord with the intensity of the light that strikes it. Thus with a beam of light we can reproduce the human voice. Well, what we have done awkwardly and tentatively by the aid of imperfect mechanical contrivances, Nature has here accomplished perfectly through the peculiar composition of the air and some special adjustment of the auditory apparatus of this people.  "Light and sound, color and music, are linked for them in a manner entirely beyond our comprehension. It is plain to me now that the music of color which we witnessed at the capital, was something far more complete and wonderful than I then imagined. Together with the pleasure which they derive from the harmonic combinations of shifting hues, they drink in, at the same time, the delight arising from sounds which are associated with, and, in many cases, awakened by, those very colors. It is probable that all their senses are far more fully, though more delicately, developed than ours. The perfume of these wonderful flowers is probably more delightful to Ala than to us. As there are sounds which they hear though inaudible to us, and colors visible to them which lie beyond the range of our vision, so there may be vibrations affecting the olfactory nerves which make no impression upon our sense of smell."  "Well, well," I exclaimed, "this seems appropriate to Venus."  "Yes," said Edmund with a smile, "it is appropriate; and yet I am not sure that some day we may not arrive at something of the kind on the earth."  I was about to ask him what he meant when there came an exciting interruption. Ingra, who had fallen more and more under the influence of the champagne, had stumbled to the other side of the little glade, virtually unnoticed, and Juba had wandered out of sight. Suddenly there came from the direction of the car the sound of a struggle mingled with inarticulate cries. We sprang to our feet, and, running to the car, found both Ingra and Juba inside it. The former had his hands on one of the knobs controlling the mechanism, and Juba had grasped him round the waist and was trying to drag him away. Ingra was resisting with all his strength, and uttering strange noises, whose sense, if they had any, we, of course, did not comprehend. Just as we reached the door, Juba succeeded in wrenching his opponent from his hold, and immediately gave him a fling which sent him clear out of the car, tumbling in a heap at our feet. Juba's eyes were ablaze with a dangerous light, but the moment he encountered Edmund's gaze he quietly walked away and sat down on the bank. Ala was immediately by our side, and I thought that I could read embarrassment as well as surprise in her looks. Fortunately the knob that Ingra had grasped had been thrown out of connection; else he and Juba might have made an involuntary voyage through space.  We picked up Ingra, found a seat for him, and Edmund, going down to the brook, filled a pocket flask with water and flung it in the fellow's face. This was repeated several times with the effect of finally straightening out his muddled senses sufficiently to warrant us in embarking for the return trip. All the way home Ingra was in a sulky mood, like any terrestrial drunkard after a debauch, but he kept his eyes on all Edmund's movements with an expression of cunning, which he had not sufficient self-command to conceal, and which could leave no doubt in our minds as to the nature of the quest which had led him into the car. As to Juba--although his interference had been of no practical benefit, since Ingra, especially in his present state, could surely have made no discovery of any importance--the devotion which he had again shown to our interests endeared him the more to us. Ala's manner showed that she was deeply chagrined, and thus our trip, which had opened so joyously, ended in gloom, and we were glad when the car again touched the platform, and our guests departed.    CHAPTER XIX   THE SECRET OF THE CAR  Jack and Henry were overjoyed to see us again, for after our departure they had fallen into a despondent mood, and began to imagine all sorts of evil.  "Jo!" was Jack's greeting; "I never was so glad to see anybody in my life. Edmund, don't you ever go off and leave any of us alone again."  "I'll never leave you again," responded Edmund. "You can count on that."  Then we told them the story of what we had seen, and of what had happened in the wild Eden that we had visited. They were not so much interested in the most wonderful thing of all--the combination of sound and color--as they were in the conduct of Ingra. Jack laughed until he was tired over Ingra's drunkenness, but he drew a long face when he heard of the adventure in the car.  "Edmund," he said earnestly, "I am beginning to be of Henry's opinion; you had better get away from here without losing a moment."  "No," said Edmund, "we'll not go yet. The time hasn't come to run away. What difference does it make even if Ingra does suspect that the car is moved by some mechanism instead of by pure magic? He could not understand it if I should explain it to him."  "But you have said that he is extraordinarily intelligent."  "So he is, but his intelligence is limited by the world he lives in, and while there are many marvelous things here, nobody has the slightest conception of inter-atomic force. They have never heard even of radioactivity. At the same time I don't mean that they shall go nosing about the car. I'll take care of that."  "But," said Jack, "it grinds me to see that brute Ingra get off scot-free after trying to murder us. And what has he got against us, anyway? But for him we should never have had any trouble. He was against us from the beginning."  "I don't think he was particularly _against_ us at the start," said Edmund. "Only he was for treating us with less consideration than Ala was disposed to show. But after the first accidental shooting, and the drubbing that Juba gave him, naturally his prejudices were aroused, and he could hardly be blamed for thinking us dangerous. Then, when he found himself defeated, and his wishes disregarded, on all sides, he began to hate us. It is easy enough to account for his feelings. Now, since our recent astonishing triumph, being himself incredulous about our celestial origin, he will try to undermine us by showing that our seeming miracle is no miracle at all."  "And you gave him the chance by taking him in the car!" I could not help exclaiming.  "Yes," said Edmund, with a smile. "I admit that I made a mistake. I counted too much upon the influence of the sense of mystery. But it will come out all right."  "I doubt it," I persisted. "He will never rest now until he has found out the secret."  Nothing more was said on the subject, but Edmund was careful not to leave the car unguarded. It was always kept afloat, though in contact with the landing. The expenditure of energy needed to keep it thus anchored without support was, Edmund assured us, insignificant in comparison with the quantity stored in his mysterious batteries.  We were not long in finding, on all sides, evidence that our trip up through the cloud dome had been a master stroke, and that the presumable incredulity of Ingra with regard to our claims was not shared by others. He might have his intimates, who entertained prejudices against us resembling his own, but if so we saw nothing of them. In fact, Ingra was much less in evidence than before, but I did not feel reassured by that; on the contrary, it made me all the more fearful of some plot on his part, and Jack was decidedly of my opinion.  "Hang him!" he said, "he's up to some mischief, and I know it. Much as I detest him, I'd rather have him _in_ sight than _out_, just now. He makes me feel like a snake in a bush; if he'd only show his ugly head, or spring his rattle, I'd be more comfortable."  But the kindness and deference with which we were treated, and the new wonders that were shown to us in the capital, gradually drove Ingra from our minds. Now we were permitted to enter the temples without opposition, our presence there according with our new character of "children of the sun." We saw the worship that was offered before the solar images by family parties, and attended, as favored guests, the periodical ceremonies in the great temple. Edmund confessed that the high priest greatly embarrassed him by staring into his eyes, and plainly assuming that he knew things of which he was profoundly ignorant.  "The hardest thing I ever undertook," he said, "is to hold my mind in suspense during these trying interviews, when he endeavors to read the depths of my soul, and I to throw a veil over them which he cannot penetrate."  In some way, Edmund discovered that the high priest and all the priests connected with the sun worship (and they certainly bore a family likeness) belonged to a special race, whose roots ran back into the most remote antiquity, and about whose persons clung a sacredness that placed them, in some respects, above the royal family itself. We frequently visited the great library, where Edmund undertook a study of the language of the printed rolls, though what he made of it I never clearly understood. I do not think that he succeeded in deciphering any of it. He also spent much time studying their mechanics and engineering, for which he professed great admiration.  But most interesting of all to us was what Edmund himself accomplished. I have told you of his remark about the color-sound music, viz., that he thought it not impossible that even human senses might be enabled to appreciate it. Well, he actually realized that wildly improbable dream! He fitted up a laboratory of his own in which he labored sometimes for twenty hours at a stretch, and at last he brought to us the astonishing invention he had made.  I can make no pretense of understanding it; although Edmund declared that, in substance, it was no more wonderful than a telephone. The machine consisted of a little metal box. (He made three of them, and I have mine yet, but it will not work on the earth, and it lies on my table as I write, serving for the most wonderful paper weight that a man ever possessed.) When this box was pressed against the ear in front of one of the revolving disks that threw out blending colors, or in the presence of a "singing" bird, the most divine harmonies seemed to awake _in the brain_. I cannot make the slightest approach to a description of the marvelous phenomenon. One felt his whole being infused with ecstatic joy. It was the very soul of music itself, celestial, ineffable! The wonder-box also enabled us to catch many sounds peculiar to the atmosphere of Venus, formed of vibrations, as Edmund had explained, that lie outside our gamut. But to these, apart from the music, I could never listen. They were _too_ abnormal, filling one with inexplicable terror, as if he had been snatched out of nature and compelled to listen to the sounds of a preternatural world. The only sound that I ever heard with my natural ear which bore the slightest resemblance to these was the awful piercing whistle of the monster that killed Ala's man.  Yet we derived immense pleasure from the possession of those little boxes. With their aid, we could appreciate the exquisite melodies that were played everywhere--in great halls where thousands were assembled, in the temples great and small, and in the homes of the people, to which we were often admitted. In every house there was on one of the walls a "musical rose," whose harmonies entranced the visitor. And the variety of musical _motifs_ seemed to be absolutely without limit. One was never tired of the entertainment because there was so little repetition.  On one ever-memorable occasion we heard the great national, or, as Edmund preferred to call it, "racial" hymn, played in the air from the principal tower. When we had only beheld the play of colors characterizing this composition we had found it altogether delightful, although, as I have said, Edmund detected, even then, some underlying tone of sadness or despair; but when its _sounds_ broke into the brain the effect was overwhelming. The entire thing seemed to have been "written in a minor key," of infinite world-embracing pathos. The listener was plunged into depths of feeling that seemed unfathomable, eternal--and unendurable.  "Heavens!" whispered Jack to me in an awed voice, dropping the box from his ear, "I can't _stand_ it!"  I saw tears running down his face, and felt them on my own. Edmund and Henry were equally affected, and could not continue to listen. Edmund said nothing, but I recalled his words about the traditional belief of this people that their world had entered upon the last stage of its existence. Then I watched the countenances about us; they wore an expression of solemnity, and yet there was something which spoke of an uplifting pride, awakened by the great paean, and swelling the heart with memories of interminable ages of past glory.  "Come," said Edmund at last, turning away, "this is not for us. The measureless sadness we feel, but the triumphant reflection of ancestral greatness is for them alone. Heavens! what an artist he must have been who composed this!--if it be not like the Iliad, the work of an age rather than of a man."  We almost forgot the passage of time in the enjoyment of our now delightful and untroubled existence, but there came at last a rude awakening from this life, which had become for us like a dream.  As I have said, we had ceased to worry about Ingra, whom we seldom saw, and who, when we did see him, gave no indication of continued enmity. At first we had kept the car under continual surveillance, but as time went on we became careless in this respect, and at last we did not guard it at all.  One day, during the time of repose, I happened to be, with Juba, in our room on that stage of the great tower where the car was anchored, while Edmund and the others were below in the palace. Juba was already asleep, and I was lying down and courting drowsiness, when a slight noise outside attracted my attention. I stepped softly to the door and looked out. The door of the car was open! Supposing that Edmund was there I approached to speak to him. By good fortune I was wearing the soft slippers worn by everybody here, and which we had adopted, so that my footsteps made no sound.  As I reached the car door and looked in, I nearly dropped in the intensity of my surprise and consternation. There, at the farther end, was Ingra, on his knees before the mechanical mouths which swallowed the invisible elements of power from the air; and beside him was another, also on his knees, and busy with tools, apparently trying to detach the things. The explanation flashed over my mind; Ingra had brought a skilled engineer to aid him in discovering the secret of the car, and, no doubt, to rob it of its mysterious mechanism. They seemed to fear no interruption, because Ingra had undoubtedly informed himself of the fact that for a day or two past we had abandoned the use of our room in the tower, and taken our repose in our apartments in the palace. It was by mere chance that Juba and I had, on this occasion, remained so long aloft that I had decided to take our sleep in the tower room.  Anticipating no surveillance, Ingra was not on his guard, and had no idea that I was behind him. Instinctively I grasped for my pistol but instantly remembered that it was with my coat in the room. I tiptoed back, awoke Juba, making him a sign to be noiseless, got the pistol, and returned, without a sound, to the open door of the car with Juba at my heels. They were yet on their knees, with their heads under the shelf, and I heard the slight grating made by the tool that Ingra's assistant was using. The pistol was in my hand. What should I do? Shoot him down without warning, or trust to the strength of Juba to enable us to overcome them both and make them prisoners?  While I hesitated, and it was but a moment, Ingra suddenly rose to his feet and confronted us. An exclamation burst from his lips, and the other sprang up. I covered Ingra with the pistol and pulled the trigger. There was not a sound! The sickening remembrance then burst over me that I had not reloaded the pistol since Edmund had emptied its whole chamber in the closing fight with the tarantula of the swamps. Ingra, followed by his man, sprang upon me like a tiger. In a twinkling I lay on my back, and before I could recover my feet, I saw Juba and Ingra in a deadly struggle, while the other ran away and disappeared. Jumping up I ran to Juba's assistance, but the fight was so furious, and the combatants whirled so rapidly, that I could get no hold. I saw, however, that Juba was more than a match for his opponent, and I darted into the car to get one of the automatic rifles, thinking that I could use it as a club to put an end to the struggle if the opportunity should offer. But the locker was firmly closed and I could not open it. After a minute of vain efforts I returned to the combatants and found that Juba had nearly completed his mastery. He had Ingra doubled over his knee and was endeavoring to pinion his hands.  At this instant, when the victory seemed complete, and our enemy in our power, Juba uttered a faint cry and fell in a heap. Blood instantly stained the floor around him, and Ingra, with a bound, dropping a long knife, attained the door of a nearby chamber, and was out of sight before I could even start to pursue him. Nevertheless, I ran after him, but quickly became involved in a labyrinth where it was useless to continue the search, and where I nearly lost my way.  I then returned to see how seriously Juba had been wounded. He had crawled into the car. I bent over him--he was dead! The knife had inflicted a fearful wound, and it seemed wonderful that he could have made his way unassisted even over the short distance from where he was struck down to the door of the car.  _Juba dead!_ I felt faint and sick! But the critical nature of the emergency helped to steady my nerves by giving me something else to think of and to do. Edmund must be called at once. There were no "elevators" running regularly during the general hours of repose, and I did not know the way up and down the tower by the ladder-like stairways which connected the stages. But there were signals by which the little craft that served as elevators could be summoned in case of necessity, and I pulled one of the signal cords. It seemed an age before the air ship came, and another before I could reach Edmund.  His great self-control enabled him to conceal his grief at my news, but Jack was overcome. He had really loved Juba almost as if he had been human and a brother. The big-hearted fellow actually sobbed as if his heart would break. Then came the reaction, and I should never have believed that Jack Ashton could exhibit such malevolent ferocity. His lips all but foamed, as he fairly shouted, striking his big fists together:  "This'll be _my_ job! Edmund! Peter! You hear me! Don't either of you dare to lay a hand on _that devil!_ He's _mine!_ Oh! I'll--" But he could not finish his sentence for gnashing his teeth.  We calmed him as best we could and then summoned an air ship. While we waited, Edmund suddenly put his hand in his pocket, and withdrawing it quickly, said, with a bitter smile:  "What a fool I have been in my carelessness. Ingra has had the key abstracted from my pocket by some thief. That explains how he got the car open."  The moment the ship came we hurriedly ascended to the platform. When Edmund saw poor Juba's body lying in the car and learned how he had made his way there to die, he was more affected than when he first heard of his death.  "He has died for us," he said solemnly; "he has crawled here as to a refuge, and here he shall remain until I can bury him among his people in his old home. Would to God I had never taken him from it!"  "Then you will start at once for the dark hemisphere?" I asked.  "At the earliest possible moment; and it shall be on the way to our own home."  But we were not to depart before even a more terrible tragedy had darkened over us, for now the tide of fate was suddenly running at flood.    CHAPTER XX   THE CORYBANTIA OF THE SUN  I have several times mentioned Edmund's half-formed impression that there was some very remarkable ceremony connected with the cyclical apparition of the sun before the eyes of its worshipers. He had said, you may recall, that it seemed probable that the religious rites on these rare occasions bore some resemblance to the _bacchanalia_, or _dionysia_, of ancient Greece. How he had derived that idea I do not know, but it proved to have been but too well founded---only he had not guessed the full truth. The followers of Dionysus made themselves drunken with the wine of their god and then indulged in the wildest excesses. Here, as we were now to learn, the worshipers of the sun were seized with another kind of madness, leading to scenes that I believe, and hope, have never had their parallel upon the earth.  With our hearts sore for Juba, we had completed our preparations for departure within six hours after his tragic death. Ala had been informed of the tragedy, and had visited the car and looked upon the dead form, which I thought greatly affected her. Edmund held little communication with her, but it was evidently with her cooperation that he was able to procure a kind of coffin, in which we placed Juba's body. I do not know whether Edmund informed her of his purpose to quit the planet, but she must have known that we were going to convey our friend somewhere for interment.  We were actually on the point of casting loose the car, Ala and a crowd of attendants watching our movements, when there came the second great sound of united voices which we had heard in this speechless world. It rose like a sudden wail from the whole city. There was a rushing to and fro, Ala's face grew as pale as death, and her attendants fell upon their knees and began to lift their hands heavenward, with an expression of terror and wild appeal.  At the same time we noticed a sudden brightening about us, and Edmund stepping out on the platform, immediately beckoned, with the first signs of uncontrollable excitement that I had ever seen him display. I was instantly at his side, and a single glance told the story.  High in the heavens, the sun had burst forth in all its marvelous splendor!  A vast rift was open in the cloud dome, through which the gigantic god of day poured down his rays with a fierceness that was inconceivable. The heat was like the blast of a furnace, and I felt my head beginning to swim.  "Quick!" cried Edmund, grasping my sleeve and pulling me into the car. "These rays are fatal! My God, what a sight!"  As by magic the atmosphere had become crowded with air ships, and throngs of thousands were pouring from them upon the great platform and the other stages, as well as upon the surrounding towers. Every available space was filling up with people hastening from below. As fast as they arrived they threw themselves into the most extraordinary postures of adoration, lifting hands and eyes to the sun. I remember thinking, in a flash, that the intense glare of light must burn to the very sockets of their eyes--but they did not flinch. It was evident, however, that those who looked directly in the sun's face were blinded.  I looked round for Ala, and noticed with a thrill that her beautiful eyes were wide open and glancing with an expression that I cannot describe, over her kneeling people. Beside her was the towering form of the great priest, who was staring straight at the sun--and yet, although his eyes were open, it was evident that they were not rendered altogether sightless even by that awful light. They burned like coals. He was making strange gestures with his long arms, and in unison with his every movement a low, heart-thrilling sound came from the throats of the multitude.  Edmund, at my shoulder, muttered under his breath:  "Shall I try to save her from this?--But to what good?"  For a moment he seemed to hesitate, and I thought that he was about to rush out upon the platform and seize Ala in order to rescue her from some danger that he foresaw; when, all at once, the multitude rose to its feet, staggering, and began to rush to and fro, colliding with one another, falling, rising again, grappling, struggling, uttering terrible cries--and then I saw the flash of knives.  "Good heavens!" shouted Edmund. "It is the ultraviolet rays! They have gone mad!"  In the meantime the gigantic high priest whirled upon his heel, swinging his arms abroad and uttering a kind of chant which was audible above the dreadful clamor of the rabid multitude. Though he had no weapon, he seemed the inspirer of this Aceldama, and around him its fury raged. Presently he drew close to Ala, who still stood motionless, as if petrified by the awful scene. I felt Edmund give a violent start, and before I comprehended his intention, he had dashed from the car, and was forcing his way through the struggling throng toward the queen.  "Edmund!" I shouted. "For God's sake, come back!"  Jack started to follow him, but I held him back with all my strength.  "Let me go!" he yelled. "Edmund will be killed!"  "And you, too!" I answered. "Break open the locker and get the guns!"  Jack threw himself upon the door of the locker, and strove to wrench it open. Meanwhile, half paralyzed with excitement, I remained standing at the door. I saw Edmund hurl aside those who attacked him, and push on toward his goal. But a minute later a knife reached him, and he fell.  "Quick, Jack, quick!" I shouted; "Edmund is down!"  He had not got the locker open, but he darted to my side, and together we rushed out into the press. Shall I ever forget that moment! We were pushed, hustled, struck, hurled to and fro; but we had only a few steps to go, and we reached our leader where he lay. Seizing him, we succeeded somehow in carrying him into the car. Our clothes were torn, our hands and faces were bleeding, and there was blood on Jack's shoulder. Edmund was alive. We placed him on a bench, and then the fascination of the spectacle without again enchained us.  Suddenly my eyes fell upon Ingra, who had not previously made his appearance. He was as insane as the others, and like many of them had a knife in his hand. In a moment he pushed his way toward Ala, and my heart rose in my throat, for I did not know what mad thought might be in his mind. If I had had a weapon, I believe I should have shot him, but before he had arrived within three yards of the queen there came an explosion of flame--I do not know how else to describe it, for it was so sudden--and the great platform was instantly wrapped in licking tongues of fire.  The wickerwork caught like tinder, and the gauzy screws threw off streams of sparks like so many Fourth of July pinwheels. The gush of heat from the conflagration was terrible, and I turned my eyes in horror from the stricken multitude which seemed to have been shocked back into sanity by the sudden universal danger only to find itself a helpless prey to the flames.  "It's all over with them!" cried Jack.  His words awoke me to our own danger. We must get away instantly. Knowing the proper button to touch to throw the mechanism into action, I pushed it forcibly and pulled out a knob which I had often seen Edmund manipulate in starting the car. It responded immediately, and in a second we were afloat, and clear of the tower. Seeing that the direction which the car was taking would remove us from the reach of the flames, and that there was nothing ahead to obstruct its progress, and knowing that Edmund often left it to run of itself when the speed was slow, and there was no occasion to change its course, I now hurried with Jack to Edmund's side. Henry all this time had been lying on a bench like one in a trance.  Jack and I stripped off Edmund's coat, and at once saw the nature of his wound. A knife had penetrated his side, and there was considerable effusion of blood, but I was surgeon enough to feel sure that the wound was not mortal. He roused up as he felt us working over him, and opening his eyes, said faintly:  "You will find bandages under the locker. What has happened? We are moving."  "The tower is all in flames!" exclaimed Jack, before I could interrupt him, for I should have preferred not to tell Edmund the real situation just at that moment.  Jack's words roused him like an electric shock. He pushed us aside, and struggled to his feet. Then he sprang to a knob, and brought the car to rest.  We had been moving slowly, and had not gone more than a quarter of a mile from the tower. The car had swung round so that the fire was not visible from the open door, but now, as Edmund arrested its progress, it swayed back again and the spectacle burst into view. The heat smote us in the face even at this distance. In the few minutes since I had last seen the tower the flames had made incredible progress. The whole of the immense structure was blazing. Spires of flame leaped and swayed from its summit, partitions were falling, platforms giving way, and hundreds of air ships caught by the sheets of fire were crumpling and falling in swooping curves like birds whose wings had been seared. I was thankful that we could not see the unfortunates who were perishing in that furnace. It was but too evident that not a soul on the tower could have escaped.  I glanced at Edmund's face. It was pale and set--the face of a man gazing upon an awful tragedy with which he is absolutely powerless to interfere. His breath came quick, but he did not utter a word. Then came the reaction, and, staggering, he leaned on my shoulder, and I led him to the bench from which he had risen. For a moment I thought he had fainted, but when I put a flask to his lips he swallowed a mouthful and immediately recovered sufficient strength to sit up, resting his head on his hand.  "Had we not better go on?" I asked.  "Ye-es," he replied, after a moment's hesitation. "We can do nothing. They are all gone; the queen has perished with the rest! Pull out that knob on the right, but gently, and then push this button. We must circle round the outskirts until we see whether the fire will seize upon the other towers and extend to the city below."  I followed his directions, and, as we started our circuit, the vast tower suddenly swayed aside, and then, tumbling in upon itself, it went down in a whirl of smoke and eddying sparks.  As far as we could see none of the other aerial structures had caught fire. The entire absence of wind was no doubt the favorable circumstance that saved them. But all the towers were swaying under the impulse imparted to them by the excited multitudes that crowded their platforms. Although the light of the conflagration faded as soon as the principal tower fell, the others continued to shine brilliantly in the solar rays, but suddenly, as we watched, the splendor failed, and the subdued illumination characteristic of the endless daylight under the great dome took its place. The rift in the clouds above had closed as unexpectedly as it had recently opened, and the sun was no longer visible. It had been in view less than an hour, but in that brief space what scenes had been enacted!  Presently Edmund, shaking his head sadly, said:  "It is useless to stay longer. Even if the conflagration should spread we could do nothing to help the unfortunates. They must depend upon themselves."  He then gave me directions for changing our course to a direct line away from the city, at the same time increasing the speed. In the meantime he himself aided in binding up his wound.  "If there were the slightest chance that Ala could have escaped," he said, after a few minutes, "I would remain here, and search for her, but it is only too clear what her fate has been. She was really our only friend, and now that she is gone, we must get away from the sight and memory of these things as quickly as possible."  Seeing that his strength was gradually coming back to him, and secretly rejoicing that he bore this terrible blow so stoically, I felt that we might now converse about the catastrophe which we had witnessed.  "What do you think was the cause of the sudden outburst of fire?" I asked.  "It could hardly have been the direct action of the sunlight," he replied. "It must have resulted from some accidental concentration of the solar rays upon an inflammable substance by a mirror."  "I recall seeing a large concave glass on the principal platform in which they were fond of looking at their magnified images," I said.  "Yes, and no doubt that was the instrument chosen by fate to bring about this terrible end. The power of the sunbeams is twice as great here as upon the earth, and the heat in the focus of a mirror a couple of feet in diameter would suffice to set fire to the flimsy materials which abounded on the tower. Once started in such a place it ran like sparks in a train of gunpowder."  "But the madness that seized the multitude before the catastrophe--what did you mean by saying that it was the ultraviolet rays?"  "I used the term," Edmund replied slowly, "without attaching a very clear meaning to it. It simply expressed the general thought that was in my mind. It may be some other form of solar radiation to which we are not accustomed on the earth, but which is specially effective here when the sun is uncovered because of the greater nearness of Venus. This atmosphere, notwithstanding its density, may well be diaphanous to the ultraviolet rays, owing to some peculiarity in its composition which I have not had time to study. At any rate, it is evident, from what we have seen, that the rays of the unclouded sun almost instantly affect the brain. I, myself, felt them as if a thousand needles had been thrust through my skull; and I believe that they are responsible, rather than the shock of the wound in my side, for my present weakness."  "And did you foresee the consequences of the uncovering of the sun?"  "Not altogether. I had been led to think that something extraordinary must accompany the periodical appearances of the great orb, and if I could have known that an apparition was at hand I might have made preparations for it and we might have been able to save Ala. When I saw what was going on, I tried to reach her, and you know the result."  "But is it not incredible that a people of so peaceable a disposition should be seized with such murderous instincts when driven out of their senses by the effect of the rays?"  "No, it does not seem so to me. You know the general tendency of sudden madness, which usually produces a complete reversal of the ordinary instincts of the demented persons, making them dangerous to their dearest friends. But why talk longer of this? It is too painful--too overwhelming. What can man do against the great forces of Nature? At this moment I solemnly declare to you that I regret that I ever entered upon this expedition."  While we had been talking, the car had receded to a great distance from the city, and now all but the tops of a few of the airy pinnacles were lost to our sight forever. But as we gazed, straining our sight for a last look, we perceived a familiar flickering of prismatic lightning on the horizon. We glanced at each other meaningly. It was the color speech again. But, oh, what must be the burden of their communications now! Suddenly, Edmund, whose eyes were fixed with intensity upon the scene, remarked, half shuddering:  "It is the great Paean."  Seized with curiosity, I pressed the magic box to my ear, and faintly there echoed in my brain a few disconnected strains of that solemn music. But now, more than ever, it was insufferable to me, and I dropped the box with a crash.  As Edmund recovered his strength he once more took charge of the car, and in a little while he had risen to a great height in order to take advantage of the easier going in the lighter atmosphere above. Thus we ran on for several hours until we began to catch sight of the sea, which was soon beneath us, while far ahead we saw the tumbling clouds marking the location of the belt of tempests behind which we knew lay the range of the crystal mountains. At length we issued from beneath the cloud dome, and then we saw the sun again, and the storms whipping the waters, whose waves occasionally flashed up at us through rifts in the streaming clouds beneath. And at last the icy peaks began to glitter on the horizon, and we knew that we were nearing the world of eternal night and frost. It was with strange feelings that we once more beheld the crystal mountains, for our minds were filled with the recollection of the scenes that had occurred among them when we were helpless in the grasp of their tempests. But now there was a certain exhilaration in the thought that this time we could safely sail over their summits. As we passed over them we looked eagerly for landmarks that might show where our former passage had occurred, and as Edmund purposely dropped as close to their summits as it was safe to go, I at last believed that I recognized the mighty peak of rainbows that had so nearly wrecked us.  When we had left the mountains behind and entered into the region of night, I asked Edmund how he would proceed in order to find the location of the caverns.  "I shall go by the stars," he said. "I noted the bearing of the place, and I have no doubt that I can find it again."    CHAPTER XXI   THE EARTH  Edmund's reference to the stars instantly drew my attention to the heavens. They were ablaze with amazing gems, but at first I could not see the earth among them.  "I know what you are looking for," said Edmund. "Here, look through the peephole in the bow. From our present position the earth appears but little elevated above the horizon, but when we reach the caverns, which are in the center of the dark hemisphere, we shall see her overhead."  I knelt at the peephole, and my heart was in my throat. There was our glorious planet, oh, so bright! and close beside her the moon. At the sight, an irrepressible longing arose in me to be once more at home. Jack and Henry took their turns at looking, and they were no less affected than I had been. But Edmund retained a perfect self-command:  "Do you know," he asked with an odd smile (for now the lamps were glowing, and we had plenty of light in the car), "how long we have been absent from home?"  Not one of us had kept a record.  "It is just six hundred and four days," he continued, "since we left New York. We were sixteen days on our way to Venus; six days after our arrival at the caverns occurred the conjunction of the earth, and the ceremonies that Peter will not forget as long as he refrains from hair dye; two days later we departed for the sun lands; and since then five hundred and eighty days have passed. Now, between one conjunction of the earth and Venus to the next, five hundred and eighty-four days elapse. Already five hundred and eighty-two of those days have passed, so that within two days another conjunction will occur, and if we are then at the caverns we shall doubtless witness another sacrifice to the earth and the moon."  "God forbid!" I exclaimed.  "I feel as you do," said Edmund. "We have seen enough of such things. In order, then, to hasten our arrival at the caverns, where we must bury Juba, for on that I insist, I am going to rise up out of the atmosphere, in order that we may fly with planetary speed. We can thus reach the caverns, traversing the five thousand miles of distance that yet remain, in something like an hour, for some time must be lost in rising out of and returning into the atmosphere, and in the meantime I must make observations to determine our location. Having found the caverns we will complete our rites at Juba's grave, and get away for good before the sacrificial ceremonies begin."  It was a programme that suited us all, and it was quickly carried out. I had not thought that my admiration of Edmund's ability could be increased, but it was carried a notch higher when I saw how easily, guiding himself by the ever-visible stars, he located the caverns. When he knew that he was directly over them he dropped the car swiftly, and we could not repress a cry as we saw directly beneath us the familiar shafts of light issuing from the ground.  "We may have to do a little searching," said Edmund, as we approached the lights, "for, of course, my observations are not accurate enough to enable me to locate the exact spot where we landed before."  But fortune favored us marvelously, and the very first opening that we approached was at once recognized, for there stood the sacrificial altar.  We anchored the car near the shaft, and carried out Juba's coffin.  "Wait here," said Edmund, "while I descend."  "No, you're not going alone," exclaimed Jack. "I'll go with you."  Edmund made no objection and he and Jack descended the steps. Half an hour elapsed before they returned, accompanied by a dozen of the natives, stolid, and not exhibiting the signs of surprise over our return which I had expected to see. Edmund had now made so much progress in their strange means of communication that he had little difficulty in causing them to comprehend what was wanted. They easily carried the coffin, and all of us followed down into the depths. It was the strangest funeral procession that ever a man saw!  While the grave was being prepared in the underground cemetery where we had witnessed the interment of the first victim of our pistols, Henry and I remained as a sort of guard of honor for Juba in the lower of the two great chambers which have been described in the earlier chapters of this history, and there a most singular thing occurred. We were startled by a low whining, and looking about saw one of the doglike creatures which appeared to be the only inhabitants of the caverns except the natives seated on its haunches close to the coffin, and exhibiting exactly the signs of distress that a dog sometimes displays over its dead master. That we were taken aback by this scene I need not assure you. We had never observed, during our former visit, that either Juba or any of his people was followed by these creatures; in fact, they had always fled at our approach, and we had paid little attention to them.  But now, if the poor animal could have spoken, he could not more plainly have told us that, by means of the mysterious instinct which beings of his kind possess, he had recognized the presence of his old master, and was mourning for him. It was truly a touching spectacle, and Henry was hardly less moved by it than I. When Edmund and Jack came back, having superintended the preparations, Jack was cut to the heart by the sight. Immediately he declared that the "dog" must accompany us in the car, and Edmund assented by a grave inclination of the head. The animal followed us to the grave, and remained there watching us intently. He seemed to have dismissed his fear, as if he comprehended that we were friends of his master.  There were not more than twenty of the natives present at the interment, and none of them showed signs of sorrow. And when the grave was closed and we turned away, the little creature followed at our heels. Edmund had carved on a flat stone the word "JUBA," and left it lying on the grave, and Jack, having nothing else, threw a silver dollar on top of it. The natives probably regarded these things as talismans, or religious symbols, for they treated them with the greatest deference, and no doubt they lie there yet, and will continue to lie there through all the eons, for in those dry caverns the progress of decay can hardly be perceptible even after the passage of ages. It was a singular fact, noted by Edmund, that the natives exhibited not the slightest curiosity concerning their comrades who had been lost in the crystal mountains, and I really doubt whether they knew what the coffin contained.  When we had paid the last honors to Juba, we began to think of our final departure. This place had become disagreeable to us. After the brilliant scenes that we had witnessed on the other side of the planet, the gloom here, and the absence of all that had made the land of perpetual daylight seem a paradise of beauty, were intensely oppressive to our spirits. But Edmund still wished to make some investigations, and we were compelled to await his movements. What the nature of his investigations was I do not know, for I was devoured by the desire to get away, and did not inquire. But fully twenty-four hours had elapsed before our leader was ready to depart. In the meanwhile "Juba's dog" had become firmly attached to Jack, who petted it as probably no creature of its race had ever been petted before. It was a strange-looking animal; about as large as a terrier, with a big square head, covered with long black hair, while, in startling imitation of the hirsute adornment of the natives themselves, its body was clothed with a golden-white pelt of silky texture. It would eat anything we offered it, and seemed immensely pleased with its new master, as it had every reason for being.  During the last hours of our stay we noticed unmistakable indications of preparation for the dreaded ceremonies of the conjunction, and our departure was hastened on that account. The priests, whom Edmund had been compelled to put out of the way of further mischief on the former occasion, had been replaced by others, and we thought that, perhaps, this being the first opportunity for the display of their functions, they would try to make it memorable--which presented a still stronger reason why we should not delay. But, with one thing and another, we were held back until the very eve of the ceremonies.  When we finally stood ready to enter the car, with Juba's dog at Jack's heels, the procession up the steps had already begun. Edmund decided to wait until the multitude had all assembled. They came trooping up into the starlight, and I am sure that they had no idea of what we intended to do. Undoubtedly they must have recalled what had happened on the other occasion, but they showed no sign of either regret or anxiety on that account. They arranged themselves in a dense circle, as before, and the priests took their place in the center. At this moment Edmund gave the word to enter the car. We sprang into it, and immediately Jack and I went out on a window ledge in order to get a better view of the scene. Edmund started the car, and we rose straight toward the earth which glowed in the zenith. Our movement was unexpected, and we at once arrested the attention even of the priests. The beginning of the ceremony was stopped short. All eyes were evidently drawn to us, and when they saw the direction that we were taking a low murmur arose.  "Let me give them a parting salute," said Jack.  Edmund thought a moment, and then said:  "Very well, take a gun, but don't fire at them. If it terrifies them into abandoning their sacrifice we shall have done one good thing in this world."  Jack instantly had the gun roaring, and although we were now high above their heads, we could see that they were seized with consternation, rising from their knees, and running wildly about. Whether the noise and the sight of us flying toward the earth, had the effect which Edmund had hoped for, will never be known; but the last sight we had of living beings on Venus was the spectacle of those white forms darting about in the starry gloom.  Our long journey home was interrupted by one more almost tragic episode. When we had been ten days in flight, and the earth had become like a round moon of dazzling brilliance, Juba's dog, which had grown feeble and refused to eat, died. Jack was broken-hearted, and protested when Edmund said that the body of the animal must be thrown out. He would have liked to try to stuff the skin, but Edmund was firm.  "But if you open a window," I said, "the air will escape."  "Some of it will undoubtedly escape," Edmund replied. "But, luckily, this is the air of Venus which we are carrying, and being very dense, we can spare a little of it without serious results. I shall be quick, and there will be no danger."  It was as he had said. When the window was partially opened, for only a second or two, we distinctly felt a lowering of the atmospheric pressure that made us gasp for a moment, but instantly Edmund had the window closed again, and we were all right. As we shot away we saw the little white body gleaming in the sunlight like a thistledown, and then it disappeared forever.  "It is a new planet born," said Edmund, "and the law of gravitation will pay it as much attention as if it were a Jupiter. It may wander in space for untold ages, and sometime it may even fall within the sphere of the earth's attraction, and then Jack's wish will have been fulfilled; but it will be but a flying spark, flashing momentarily in the heavens as it shoots through the air."         *      *       *       *       *  Our home-coming was a strange one. For some reason of his own Edmund did not wish to take the car to New York. He landed in the midst of the Adirondack woods, far from any habitation, and there, concealed in a swamp, he insisted upon leaving the car. We made our way out of the wilderness to the nearest railway station, and our first care was to visit a barber and a clothing merchant. Probably, as we carried some of the guns, they took us for a party of hunters who wished to furbish up before revisiting civilization.  On reaching New York, we went, in the evening, straight to the Olympus Club, where our arrival caused a sensation. We found Church in the old corner, staring dejectedly at a newspaper. He did not see who was approaching him. Jack slapped him on the shoulder, and as he looked up and recognized us he fell back nearly fainting, and with mouth open, unable to utter a word.  "Come, old man," said Jack, "so we've found you! What did you run away for? Let me introduce you to the Columbus of Space, and don't you forget that I'm one of his lieutenants."  I don't think that Church has ever fully believed our story. He thinks, to this day, that we lost our "balloon," as he calls it, and invented the rest. We purposely allowed the newspaper reporters to take the same view of the case, but when we four were alone we unburdened our hearts, and relived the marvelous life of Venus. I use the past tense, because I have yet to tell you most disquieting news.  Edmund has disappeared.  Within three months after our return he bade us good night at an unusually early hour and we have never seen him since, although more than a year has now elapsed since he went out of the room at the Olympus. Jack and I have made every effort to find a trace of him, without avail. Led by a natural suspicion, we have ransacked the Adirondack woods, but we could never satisfy ourselves that we had found the place where the car was left. Henry persists in the belief that Edmund is trying in secret to develop his invention, with the intention of "revolutionizing industry and making himself a multibillionaire." But Jack and I know better! Wherever he may be, whatever may occupy his wonderful powers, we feel that the ordinary concerns of the earth have no interest for him. Yet we are sure that if he is alive he often thinks of us.  Last night as Jack and I were walking to the club with my completed manuscript under my arm, a falling star shot across the sky.  "Do you know what that recalls to me?" asked Jack, with a far-off expression in his eyes.  "What?"  "Juba's dog."  Neither of us spoke again before we reached the clubhouse steps, but I am certain that through both our minds there streamed a glittering procession of such memories as life on this planet could never give birth to. And they ended with a sigh.  THE ENDPROLOGUE   IN THE FIRST PLACE PLEASE BEAR IN MIND THAT I do not expect you to believe this story.  Nor could you wonder had you witnessed a recent experience of mine when, in the armor of blissful and stupendous ignorance, I gaily narrated the gist of it to a Fellow of the Royal Geological Society on the occasion of my last trip to London.  You would surely have thought that I had been detected in no less a heinous crime than the purloining of the Crown Jewels from the Tower, or putting poison in the coffee of His Majesty the King.  The erudite gentleman in whom I confided congealed before I was half through!--it is all that saved him from exploding--and my dreams of an Honorary Fellowship, gold medals, and a niche in the Hall of Fame faded into the thin, cold air of his arctic atmosphere.  But I believe the story, and so would you, and so would the learned Fellow of the Royal Geological Society, had you and he heard it from the lips of the man who told it to me.  Had you seen, as I did, the fire of truth in those gray eyes; had you felt the ring of sincerity in that quiet voice; had you realized the pathos of it all--you, too, would believe.  You would not have needed the final ocular proof that I had--the weird rhamphorhynchus-like creature which he had brought back with him from the inner world.  I came upon him quite suddenly, and no less unexpectedly, upon the rim of the great Sahara Desert.  He was standing before a goat-skin tent amidst a clump of date palms within a tiny oasis.  Close by was an Arab douar of some eight or ten tents.  I had come down from the north to hunt lion.  My party consisted of a dozen children of the desert--I was the only "white" man.  As we approached the little clump of verdure I saw the man come from his tent and with hand-shaded eyes peer intently at us.  At sight of me he advanced rapidly to meet us.  "A white man!" he cried.  "May the good Lord be praised! I have been watching you for hours, hoping against hope that THIS time there would be a white man.  Tell me the date.  What year is it?"  And when I had told him he staggered as though he had been struck full in the face, so that he was compelled to grasp my stirrup leather for support.  "It cannot be!" he cried after a moment.  "It cannot be!  Tell me that you are mistaken, or that you are but joking."  "I am telling you the truth, my friend," I replied.  "Why should I deceive a stranger, or attempt to, in so simple a matter as the date?"  For some time he stood in silence, with bowed head.  "Ten years!" he murmured, at last.  "Ten years, and I thought that at the most it could be scarce more than one!" That night he told me his story--the story that I give you here as nearly in his own words as I can recall them.    I  TOWARD THE ETERNAL FIRES   I WAS BORN IN CONNECTICUT ABOUT THIRTY YEARS ago.  My name is David Innes.  My father was a wealthy mine owner.  When I was nineteen he died.  All his property was to be mine when I had attained my majority--provided that I had devoted the two years intervening in close application to the great business I was to inherit.  I did my best to fulfil the last wishes of my parent--not because of the inheritance, but because I loved and honored my father.  For six months I toiled in the mines and in the counting-rooms, for I wished to know every minute detail of the business.  Then Perry interested me in his invention.  He was an old fellow who had devoted the better part of a long life to the perfection of a mechanical subterranean prospector.  As relaxation he studied paleontology.  I looked over his plans, listened to his arguments, inspected his working model--and then, convinced, I advanced the funds necessary to construct a full-sized, practical prospector.  I shall not go into the details of its construction--it lies out there in the desert now--about two miles from here.  Tomorrow you may care to ride out and see it.  Roughly, it is a steel cylinder a hundred feet long, and jointed so that it may turn and twist through solid rock if need be.  At one end is a mighty revolving drill operated by an engine which Perry said generated more power to the cubic inch than any other engine did to the cubic foot.  I remember that he used to claim that that invention alone would make us fabulously wealthy--we were going to make the whole thing public after the successful issue of our first secret trial--but Perry never returned from that trial trip, and I only after ten years.  I recall as it were but yesterday the night of that momentous occasion upon which we were to test the practicality of that wondrous invention.  It was near midnight when we repaired to the lofty tower in which Perry had constructed his "iron mole" as he was wont to call the thing.  The great nose rested upon the bare earth of the floor.  We passed through the doors into the outer jacket, secured them, and then passing on into the cabin, which contained the controlling mechanism within the inner tube, switched on the electric lights.  Perry looked to his generator; to the great tanks that held the life-giving chemicals with which he was to manufacture fresh air to replace that which we consumed in breathing; to his instruments for recording temperatures, speed, distance, and for examining the materials through which we were to pass.  He tested the steering device, and overlooked the mighty cogs which transmitted its marvelous velocity to the giant drill at the nose of his strange craft.  Our seats, into which we strapped ourselves, were so arranged upon transverse bars that we would be upright whether the craft were ploughing her way downward into the bowels of the earth, or running horizontally along some great seam of coal, or rising vertically toward the surface again.  At length all was ready.  Perry bowed his head in prayer.  For a moment we were silent, and then the old man's hand grasped the starting lever.  There was a frightful roaring beneath us--the giant frame trembled and vibrated--there was a rush of sound as the loose earth passed up through the hollow space between the inner and outer jackets to be deposited in our wake.  We were off!  The noise was deafening.  The sensation was frightful.  For a full minute neither of us could do aught but cling with the proverbial desperation of the drowning man to the handrails of our swinging seats.  Then Perry glanced at the thermometer.  "Gad!" he cried, "it cannot be possible--quick!  What does the distance meter read?"  That and the speedometer were both on my side of the cabin, and as I turned to take a reading from the former I could see Perry muttering.  "Ten degrees rise--it cannot be possible!" and then I saw him tug frantically upon the steering wheel.  As I finally found the tiny needle in the dim light I translated Perry's evident excitement, and my heart sank within me.  But when I spoke I hid the fear which haunted me.  "It will be seven hundred feet, Perry," I said, "by the time you can turn her into the horizontal."  "You'd better lend me a hand then, my boy," he replied, "for I cannot budge her out of the vertical alone.  God give that our combined strength may be equal to the task, for else we are lost."  I wormed my way to the old man's side with never a doubt but that the great wheel would yield on the instant to the power of my young and vigorous muscles.  Nor was my belief mere vanity, for always had my physique been the envy and despair of my fellows.  And for that very reason it had waxed even greater than nature had intended, since my natural pride in my great strength had led me to care for and develop my body and my muscles by every means within my power. What with boxing, football, and baseball, I had been in training since childhood.  And so it was with the utmost confidence that I laid hold of the huge iron rim; but though I threw every ounce of my strength into it, my best effort was as unavailing as Perry's had been--the thing would not budge--the grim, insensate, horrible thing that was holding us upon the straight road to death!  At length I gave up the useless struggle, and without a word returned to my seat.  There was no need for words--at least none that I could imagine, unless Perry desired to pray.  And I was quite sure that he would, for he never left an opportunity neglected where he might sandwich in a prayer.  He prayed when he arose in the morning, he prayed before he ate, he prayed when he had finished eating, and before he went to bed at night he prayed again.  In between he often found excuses to pray even when the provocation seemed far-fetched to my worldly eyes--now that he was about to die I felt positive that I should witness a perfect orgy of prayer--if one may allude with such a simile to so solemn an act.  But to my astonishment I discovered that with death staring him in the face Abner Perry was transformed into a new being.  From his lips there flowed--not prayer--but a clear and limpid stream of undiluted profanity, and it was all directed at that quietly stubborn piece of unyielding mechanism.  "I should think, Perry," I chided, "that a man of your professed religiousness would rather be at his prayers than cursing in the presence of imminent death."  "Death!" he cried.  "Death is it that appalls you?  That is nothing by comparison with the loss the world must suffer.  Why, David within this iron cylinder we have demonstrated possibilities that science has scarce dreamed.  We have harnessed a new principle, and with it animated a piece of steel with the power of ten thousand men.  That two lives will be snuffed out is nothing to the world calamity that entombs in the bowels of the earth the discoveries that I have made and proved in the successful construction of the thing that is now carrying us farther and farther toward the eternal central fires."  I am frank to admit that for myself I was much more concerned with our own immediate future than with any problematic loss which the world might be about to suffer.  The world was at least ignorant of its bereavement, while to me it was a real and terrible actuality.  "What can we do?" I asked, hiding my perturbation beneath the mask of a low and level voice.  "We may stop here, and die of asphyxiation when our atmosphere tanks are empty," replied Perry, "or we may continue on with the slight hope that we may later sufficiently deflect the prospector from the vertical to carry us along the arc of a great circle which must eventually return us to the surface.  If we succeed in so doing before we reach the higher internal temperature we may even yet survive.  There would seem to me to be about one chance in several million that we shall succeed--otherwise we shall die more quickly but no more surely than as though we sat supinely waiting for the torture of a slow and horrible death."  I glanced at the thermometer.  It registered 110 degrees.  While we were talking the mighty iron mole had bored its way over a mile into the rock of the earth's crust.  "Let us continue on, then," I replied.  "It should soon be over at this rate.  You never intimated that the speed of this thing would be so high, Perry.  Didn't you know it?"  "No," he answered.  "I could not figure the speed exactly, for I had no instrument for measuring the mighty power of my generator. I reasoned, however, that we should make about five hundred yards an hour."  "And we are making seven miles an hour," I concluded for him, as I sat with my eyes upon the distance meter.  "How thick is the Earth's crust, Perry?" I asked.  "There are almost as many conjectures as to that as there are geologists," was his answer.  "One estimates it thirty miles, because the internal heat, increasing at the rate of about one degree to each sixty to seventy feet depth, would be sufficient to fuse the most refractory substances at that distance beneath the surface.  Another finds that the phenomena of precession and nutation require that the earth, if not entirely solid, must at least have a shell not less than eight hundred to a thousand miles in thickness. So there you are.  You may take your choice."  "And if it should prove solid?" I asked.  "It will be all the same to us in the end, David," replied Perry. "At the best our fuel will suffice to carry us but three or four days, while our atmosphere cannot last to exceed three.  Neither, then, is sufficient to bear us in the safety through eight thousand miles of rock to the antipodes."  "If the crust is of sufficient thickness we shall come to a final stop between six and seven hundred miles beneath the earth's surface; but during the last hundred and fifty miles of our journey we shall be corpses.  Am I correct?" I asked.  "Quite correct, David.  Are you frightened?"  "I do not know.  It all has come so suddenly that I scarce believe that either of us realizes the real terrors of our position.  I feel that I should be reduced to panic; but yet I am not.  I imagine that the shock has been so great as to partially stun our sensibilities."  Again I turned to the thermometer.  The mercury was rising with less rapidity.  It was now but 140 degrees, although we had penetrated to a depth of nearly four miles.  I told Perry, and he smiled.  "We have shattered one theory at least," was his only comment, and then he returned to his self-assumed occupation of fluently cursing the steering wheel.  I once heard a pirate swear, but his best efforts would have seemed like those of a tyro alongside of Perry's masterful and scientific imprecations.  Once more I tried my hand at the wheel, but I might as well have essayed to swing the earth itself.  At my suggestion Perry stopped the generator, and as we came to rest I again threw all my strength into a supreme effort to move the thing even a hair's breadth--but the results were as barren as when we had been traveling at top speed.  I shook my head sadly, and motioned to the starting lever.  Perry pulled it toward him, and once again we were plunging downward toward eternity at the rate of seven miles an hour.  I sat with my eyes glued to the thermometer and the distance meter.  The mercury was rising very slowly now, though even at 145 degrees it was almost unbearable within the narrow confines of our metal prison.  About noon, or twelve hours after our start upon this unfortunate journey, we had bored to a depth of eighty-four miles, at which point the mercury registered 153 degrees F.  Perry was becoming more hopeful, although upon what meager food he sustained his optimism I could not conjecture.  From cursing he had turned to singing--I felt that the strain had at last affected his mind.  For several hours we had not spoken except as he asked me for the readings of the instruments from time to time, and I announced them.  My thoughts were filled with vain regrets.  I recalled numerous acts of my past life which I should have been glad to have had a few more years to live down.  There was the affair in the Latin Commons at Andover when Calhoun and I had put gunpowder in the stove--and nearly killed one of the masters.  And then--but what was the use, I was about to die and atone for all these things and several more.  Already the heat was sufficient to give me a foretaste of the hereafter.  A few more degrees and I felt that I should lose consciousness.  "What are the readings now, David?" Perry's voice broke in upon my somber reflections.  "Ninety miles and 153 degrees," I replied.  "Gad, but we've knocked that thirty-mile-crust theory into a cocked hat!" he cried gleefully.  "Precious lot of good it will do us," I growled back.  "But my boy," he continued, "doesn't that temperature reading mean anything to you?  Why it hasn't gone up in six miles.  Think of it, son!"  "Yes, I'm thinking of it," I answered; "but what difference will it make when our air supply is exhausted whether the temperature is 153 degrees or 153,000?  We'll be just as dead, and no one will know the difference, anyhow." But I must admit that for some unaccountable reason the stationary temperature did renew my waning hope.  What I hoped for I could not have explained, nor did I try. The very fact, as Perry took pains to explain, of the blasting of several very exact and learned scientific hypotheses made it apparent that we could not know what lay before us within the bowels of the earth, and so we might continue to hope for the best, at least until we were dead--when hope would no longer be essential to our happiness.  It was very good, and logical reasoning, and so I embraced it.  At one hundred miles the temperature had DROPPED TO 152 1/2 DEGREES! When I announced it Perry reached over and hugged me.  From then on until noon of the second day, it continued to drop until it became as uncomfortably cold as it had been unbearably hot before.  At the depth of two hundred and forty miles our nostrils were assailed by almost overpowering ammonia fumes, and the temperature had dropped to TEN BELOW ZERO!  We suffered nearly two hours of this intense and bitter cold, until at about two hundred and forty-five miles from the surface of the earth we entered a stratum of solid ice, when the mercury quickly rose to 32 degrees. During the next three hours we passed through ten miles of ice, eventually emerging into another series of ammonia-impregnated strata, where the mercury again fell to ten degrees below zero.  Slowly it rose once more until we were convinced that at last we were nearing the molten interior of the earth.  At four hundred miles the temperature had reached 153 degrees.  Feverishly I watched the thermometer.  Slowly it rose.  Perry had ceased singing and was at last praying.  Our hopes had received such a deathblow that the gradually increasing heat seemed to our distorted imaginations much greater than it really was.  For another hour I saw that pitiless column of mercury rise and rise until at four hundred and ten miles it stood at 153 degrees.  Now it was that we began to hang upon those readings in almost breathless anxiety.  One hundred and fifty-three degrees had been the maximum temperature above the ice stratum.  Would it stop at this point again, or would it continue its merciless climb?  We knew that there was no hope, and yet with the persistence of life itself we continued to hope against practical certainty.  Already the air tanks were at low ebb--there was barely enough of the precious gases to sustain us for another twelve hours.  But would we be alive to know or care?  It seemed incredible.  At four hundred and twenty miles I took another reading.  "Perry!" I shouted.  "Perry, man!  She's going down! She's going down!  She's 152 degrees again."  "Gad!" he cried.  "What can it mean?  Can the earth be cold at the center?"  "I do not know, Perry," I answered; "but thank God, if I am to die it shall not be by fire--that is all that I have feared.  I can face the thought of any death but that."  Down, down went the mercury until it stood as low as it had seven miles from the surface of the earth, and then of a sudden the realization broke upon us that death was very near.  Perry was the first to discover it.  I saw him fussing with the valves that regulate the air supply.  And at the same time I experienced difficulty in breathing.  My head felt dizzy--my limbs heavy.  I saw Perry crumple in his seat.  He gave himself a shake and sat erect again.  Then he turned toward me.  "Good-bye, David," he said.  "I guess this is the end," and then he smiled and closed his eyes.  "Good-bye, Perry, and good luck to you," I answered, smiling back at him.  But I fought off that awful lethargy.  I was very young--I did not want to die.  For an hour I battled against the cruelly enveloping death that surrounded me upon all sides.  At first I found that by climbing high into the framework above me I could find more of the precious life-giving elements, and for a while these sustained me.  It must have been an hour after Perry had succumbed that I at last came to the realization that I could no longer carry on this unequal struggle against the inevitable.  With my last flickering ray of consciousness I turned mechanically toward the distance meter.  It stood at exactly five hundred miles from the earth's surface--and then of a sudden the huge thing that bore us came to a stop.  The rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased.  The wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it was running loose in AIR--and then another truth flashed upon me.  The point of the prospector was ABOVE us.  Slowly it dawned on me that since passing through the ice strata it had been above.  We had turned in the ice and sped upward toward the earth's crust.  Thank God! We were safe!  I put my nose to the intake pipe through which samples were to have been taken during the passage of the prospector through the earth, and my fondest hopes were realized--a flood of fresh air was pouring into the iron cabin.  The reaction left me in a state of collapse, and I lost consciousness.    II  A STRANGE WORLD   I WAS UNCONSCIOUS LITTLE MORE THAN AN INSTANT, for as I lunged forward from the crossbeam to which I had been clinging, and fell with a crash to the floor of the cabin, the shock brought me to myself.  My first concern was with Perry.  I was horrified at the thought that upon the very threshold of salvation he might be dead.  Tearing open his shirt I placed my ear to his breast.  I could have cried with relief--his heart was beating quite regularly.  At the water tank I wetted my handkerchief, slapping it smartly across his forehead and face several times.  In a moment I was rewarded by the raising of his lids.  For a time he lay wide-eyed and quite uncomprehending.  Then his scattered wits slowly foregathered, and he sat up sniffing the air with an expression of wonderment upon his face.  "Why, David," he cried at last, "it's air, as sure as I live. Why--why what does it mean?  Where in the world are we?  What has happened?"  "It means that we're back at the surface all right, Perry," I cried; "but where, I don't know.  I haven't opened her up yet.  Been too busy reviving you.  Lord, man, but you had a close squeak!"  "You say we're back at the surface, David?  How can that be?  How long have I been unconscious?"  "Not long.  We turned in the ice stratum.  Don't you recall the sudden whirling of our seats?  After that the drill was above you instead of below.  We didn't notice it at the time; but I recall it now."  "You mean to say that we turned back in the ice stratum, David? That is not possible.  The prospector cannot turn unless its nose is deflected from the outside--by some external force or resistance--the steering wheel within would have moved in response.  The steering wheel has not budged, David, since we started.  You know that."  I did know it; but here we were with our drill racing in pure air, and copious volumes of it pouring into the cabin.  "We couldn't have turned in the ice stratum, Perry, I know as well as you," I replied; "but the fact remains that we did, for here we are this minute at the surface of the earth again, and I am going out to see just where."  "Better wait till morning, David--it must be midnight now."  I glanced at the chronometer.  "Half after twelve.  We have been out seventy-two hours, so it must be midnight.  Nevertheless I am going to have a look at the blessed sky that I had given up all hope of ever seeing again," and so saying I lifted the bars from the inner door, and swung it open.  There was quite a quantity of loose material in the jacket, and this I had to remove with a shovel to get at the opposite door in the outer shell.  In a short time I had removed enough of the earth and rock to the floor of the cabin to expose the door beyond.  Perry was directly behind me as I threw it open.  The upper half was above the surface of the ground.  With an expression of surprise I turned and looked at Perry--it was broad daylight without!  "Something seems to have gone wrong either with our calculations or the chronometer," I said.  Perry shook his head--there was a strange expression in his eyes.  "Let's have a look beyond that door, David," he cried.  Together we stepped out to stand in silent contemplation of a landscape at once weird and beautiful.  Before us a low and level shore stretched down to a silent sea.  As far as the eye could reach the surface of the water was dotted with countless tiny isles--some of towering, barren, granitic rock--others resplendent in gorgeous trappings of tropical vegetation, myriad starred with the magnificent splendor of vivid blooms.  Behind us rose a dark and forbidding wood of giant arborescent ferns intermingled with the commoner types of a primeval tropical forest.  Huge creepers depended in great loops from tree to tree, dense under-brush overgrew a tangled mass of fallen trunks and branches.  Upon the outer verge we could see the same splendid coloring of countless blossoms that glorified the islands, but within the dense shadows all seemed dark and gloomy as the grave.  And upon all the noonday sun poured its torrid rays out of a cloudless sky.  "Where on earth can we be?" I asked, turning to Perry.  For some moments the old man did not reply.  He stood with bowed head, buried in deep thought.  But at last he spoke.  "David," he said, "I am not so sure that we are ON earth."  "What do you mean Perry?" I cried.  "Do you think that we are dead, and this is heaven?" He smiled, and turning, pointing to the nose of the prospector protruding from the ground at our backs.  "But for that, David, I might believe that we were indeed come to the country beyond the Styx.  The prospector renders that theory untenable--it, certainly, could never have gone to heaven.  However I am willing to concede that we actually may be in another world from that which we have always known.  If we are not ON earth, there is every reason to believe that we may be IN it."  "We may have quartered through the earth's crust and come out upon some tropical island of the West Indies," I suggested.  Again Perry shook his head.  "Let us wait and see, David," he replied, "and in the meantime suppose we do a bit of exploring up and down the coast--we may find a native who can enlighten us."  As we walked along the beach Perry gazed long and earnestly across the water.  Evidently he was wrestling with a mighty problem.  "David," he said abruptly, "do you perceive anything unusual about the horizon?"  As I looked I began to appreciate the reason for the strangeness of the landscape that had haunted me from the first with an illusive suggestion of the bizarre and unnatural--THERE WAS NO HORIZON! As far as the eye could reach out the sea continued and upon its bosom floated tiny islands, those in the distance reduced to mere specks; but ever beyond them was the sea, until the impression became quite real that one was LOOKING UP at the most distant point that the eyes could fathom--the distance was lost in the distance.  That was all--there was no clear-cut horizontal line marking the dip of the globe below the line of vision.  "A great light is commencing to break on me," continued Perry, taking out his watch.  "I believe that I have partially solved the riddle.  It is now two o'clock. When we emerged from the prospector the sun was directly above us.  Where is it now?"  I glanced up to find the great orb still motionless in the center of the heaven.  And such a sun!  I had scarcely noticed it before. Fully thrice the size of the sun I had known throughout my life, and apparently so near that the sight of it carried the conviction that one might almost reach up and touch it.  "My God, Perry, where are we?" I exclaimed.  "This thing is beginning to get on my nerves."  "I think that I may state quite positively, David," he commenced, "that we are--" but he got no further.  From behind us in the vicinity of the prospector there came the most thunderous, awe-inspiring roar that ever had fallen upon my ears.  With one accord we turned to discover the author of that fearsome noise.  Had I still retained the suspicion that we were on earth the sight that met my eyes would quite entirely have banished it.  Emerging from the forest was a colossal beast which closely resembled a bear.  It was fully as large as the largest elephant and with great forepaws armed with huge claws.  Its nose, or snout, depended nearly a foot below its lower jaw, much after the manner of a rudimentary trunk.  The giant body was covered by a coat of thick, shaggy hair.  Roaring horribly it came toward us at a ponderous, shuffling trot. I turned to Perry to suggest that it might be wise to seek other surroundings--the idea had evidently occurred to Perry previously, for he was already a hundred paces away, and with each second his prodigious bounds increased the distance.  I had never guessed what latent speed possibilities the old gentleman possessed.  I saw that he was headed toward a little point of the forest which ran out toward the sea not far from where we had been standing, and as the mighty creature, the sight of which had galvanized him into such remarkable action, was forging steadily toward me.  I set off after Perry, though at a somewhat more decorous pace.  It was evident that the massive beast pursuing us was not built for speed, so all that I considered necessary was to gain the trees sufficiently ahead of it to enable me to climb to the safety of some great branch before it came up.  Notwithstanding our danger I could not help but laugh at Perry's frantic capers as he essayed to gain the safety of the lower branches of the trees he now had reached.  The stems were bare for a distance of some fifteen feet--at least on those trees which Perry attempted to ascend, for the suggestion of safety carried by the larger of the forest giants had evidently attracted him to them.  A dozen times he scrambled up the trunks like a huge cat only to fall back to the ground once more, and with each failure he cast a horrified glance over his shoulder at the oncoming brute, simultaneously emitting terror-stricken shrieks that awoke the echoes of the grim forest.  At length he spied a dangling creeper about the bigness of one's wrist, and when I reached the trees he was racing madly up it, hand over hand.  He had almost reached the lowest branch of the tree from which the creeper depended when the thing parted beneath his weight and he fell sprawling at my feet.  The misfortune now was no longer amusing, for the beast was already too close to us for comfort.  Seizing Perry by the shoulder I dragged him to his feet, and rushing to a smaller tree--one that he could easily encircle with his arms and legs--I boosted him as far up as I could, and then left him to his fate, for a glance over my shoulder revealed the awful beast almost upon me.  It was the great size of the thing alone that saved me.  Its enormous bulk rendered it too slow upon its feet to cope with the agility of my young muscles, and so I was enabled to dodge out of its way and run completely behind it before its slow wits could direct it in pursuit.  The few seconds of grace that this gave me found me safely lodged in the branches of a tree a few paces from that in which Perry had at last found a haven.  Did I say safely lodged?  At the time I thought we were quite safe, and so did Perry.  He was praying--raising his voice in thanksgiving at our deliverance--and had just completed a sort of paeon of gratitude that the thing couldn't climb a tree when without warning it reared up beneath him on its enormous tail and hind feet, and reached those fearfully armed paws quite to the branch upon which he crouched.  The accompanying roar was all but drowned in Perry's scream of fright, and he came near tumbling headlong into the gaping jaws beneath him, so precipitate was his impetuous haste to vacate the dangerous limb.  It was with a deep sigh of relief that I saw him gain a higher branch in safety.  And then the brute did that which froze us both anew with horror. Grasping the tree's stem with his powerful paws he dragged down with all the great weight of his huge bulk and all the irresistible force of those mighty muscles.  Slowly, but surely, the stem began to bend toward him.  Inch by inch he worked his paws upward as the tree leaned more and more from the perpendicular.  Perry clung chattering in a panic of terror.  Higher and higher into the bending and swaying tree he clambered.  More and more rapidly was the tree top inclining toward the ground.  I saw now why the great brute was armed with such enormous paws. The use that he was putting them to was precisely that for which nature had intended them.  The sloth-like creature was herbivorous, and to feed that mighty carcass entire trees must be stripped of their foliage.  The reason for its attacking us might easily be accounted for on the supposition of an ugly disposition such as that which the fierce and stupid rhinoceros of Africa possesses. But these were later reflections.  At the moment I was too frantic with apprehension on Perry's behalf to consider aught other than a means to save him from the death that loomed so close.  Realizing that I could outdistance the clumsy brute in the open, I dropped from my leafy sanctuary intent only on distracting the thing's attention from Perry long enough to enable the old man to gain the safety of a larger tree.  There were many close by which not even the terrific strength of that titanic monster could bend.  As I touched the ground I snatched a broken limb from the tangled mass that matted the jungle-like floor of the forest and, leaping unnoticed behind the shaggy back, dealt the brute a terrific blow. My plan worked like magic.  From the previous slowness of the beast I had been led to look for no such marvelous agility as he now displayed.  Releasing his hold upon the tree he dropped on all fours and at the same time swung his great, wicked tail with a force that would have broken every bone in my body had it struck me; but, fortunately, I had turned to flee at the very instant that I felt my blow land upon the towering back.  As it started in pursuit of me I made the mistake of running along the edge of the forest rather than making for the open beach.  In a moment I was knee-deep in rotting vegetation, and the awful thing behind me was gaining rapidly as I floundered and fell in my efforts to extricate myself.  A fallen log gave me an instant's advantage, for climbing upon it I leaped to another a few paces farther on, and in this way was able to keep clear of the mush that carpeted the surrounding ground.  But the zigzag course that this necessitated was placing such a heavy handicap upon me that my pursuer was steadily gaining upon me.  Suddenly from behind I heard a tumult of howls, and sharp, piercing barks--much the sound that a pack of wolves raises when in full cry.  Involuntarily I glanced backward to discover the origin of this new and menacing note with the result that I missed my footing and went sprawling once more upon my face in the deep muck.  My mammoth enemy was so close by this time that I knew I must feel the weight of one of his terrible paws before I could rise, but to my surprise the blow did not fall upon me.  The howling and snapping and barking of the new element which had been infused into the melee now seemed centered quite close behind me, and as I raised myself upon my hands and glanced around I saw what it was that had distracted the DYRYTH, as I afterward learned the thing is called, from my trail.  It was surrounded by a pack of some hundred wolf-like creatures--wild dogs they seemed--that rushed growling and snapping in upon it from all sides, so that they sank their white fangs into the slow brute and were away again before it could reach them with its huge paws or sweeping tail.  But these were not all that my startled eyes perceived.  Chattering and gibbering through the lower branches of the trees came a company of manlike creatures evidently urging on the dog pack.  They were to all appearances strikingly similar in aspect to the Negro of Africa.  Their skins were very black, and their features much like those of the more pronounced Negroid type except that the head receded more rapidly above the eyes, leaving little or no forehead. Their arms were rather longer and their legs shorter in proportion to the torso than in man, and later I noticed that their great toes protruded at right angles from their feet--because of their arboreal habits, I presume.  Behind them trailed long, slender tails which they used in climbing quite as much as they did either their hands or feet.  I had stumbled to my feet the moment that I discovered that the wolf-dogs were holding the dyryth at bay.  At sight of me several of the savage creatures left off worrying the great brute to come slinking with bared fangs toward me, and as I turned to run toward the trees again to seek safety among the lower branches, I saw a number of the man-apes leaping and chattering in the foliage of the nearest tree.  Between them and the beasts behind me there was little choice, but at least there was a doubt as to the reception these grotesque parodies on humanity would accord me, while there was none as to the fate which awaited me beneath the grinning fangs of my fierce pursuers.  And so I raced on toward the trees intending to pass beneath that which held the man-things and take refuge in another farther on; but the wolf-dogs were very close behind me--so close that I had despaired of escaping them, when one of the creatures in the tree above swung down headforemost, his tail looped about a great limb, and grasping me beneath my armpits swung me in safety up among his fellows.  There they fell to examining me with the utmost excitement and curiosity.  They picked at my clothing, my hair, and my flesh.  They turned me about to see if I had a tail, and when they discovered that I was not so equipped they fell into roars of laughter.  Their teeth were very large and white and even, except for the upper canines which were a trifle longer than the others--protruding just a bit when the mouth was closed.  When they had examined me for a few moments one of them discovered that my clothing was not a part of me, with the result that garment by garment they tore it from me amidst peals of the wildest laughter. Apelike, they essayed to don the apparel themselves, but their ingenuity was not sufficient to the task and so they gave it up.  In the meantime I had been straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of Perry, but nowhere about could I see him, although the clump of trees in which he had first taken refuge was in full view.  I was much exercised by fear that something had befallen him, and though I called his name aloud several times there was no response.  Tired at last of playing with my clothing the creatures threw it to the ground, and catching me, one on either side, by an arm, started off at a most terrifying pace through the tree tops.  Never have I experienced such a journey before or since--even now I oftentimes awake from a deep sleep haunted by the horrid remembrance of that awful experience.  From tree to tree the agile creatures sprang like flying squirrels, while the cold sweat stood upon my brow as I glimpsed the depths beneath, into which a single misstep on the part of either of my bearers would hurl me.  As they bore me along, my mind was occupied with a thousand bewildering thoughts.  What had become of Perry?  Would I ever see him again?  What were the intentions of these half-human things into whose hands I had fallen?  Were they inhabitants of the same world into which I had been born?  No!  It could not be.  But yet where else?  I had not left that earth--of that I was sure.  Still neither could I reconcile the things which I had seen to a belief that I was still in the world of my birth. With a sigh I gave it up.    III  A CHANGE OF MASTERS   WE MUST HAVE TRAVELED SEVERAL MILES THROUGH the dark and dismal wood when we came suddenly upon a dense village built high among the branches of the trees.  As we approached it my escort broke into wild shouting which was immediately answered from within, and a moment later a swarm of creatures of the same strange race as those who had captured me poured out to meet us.  Again I was the center of a wildly chattering horde.  I was pulled this way and that.  Pinched, pounded, and thumped until I was black and blue, yet I do not think that their treatment was dictated by either cruelty or malice--I was a curiosity, a freak, a new plaything, and their childish minds required the added evidence of all their senses to back up the testimony of their eyes.  Presently they dragged me within the village, which consisted of several hundred rude shelters of boughs and leaves supported upon the branches of the trees.  Between the huts, which sometimes formed crooked streets, were dead branches and the trunks of small trees which connected the huts upon one tree to those within adjoining trees; the whole network of huts and pathways forming an almost solid flooring a good fifty feet above the ground.  I wondered why these agile creatures required connecting bridges between the trees, but later when I saw the motley aggregation of half-savage beasts which they kept within their village I realized the necessity for the pathways.  There were a number of the same vicious wolf-dogs which we had left worrying the dyryth, and many goatlike animals whose distended udders explained the reasons for their presence.  My guard halted before one of the huts into which I was pushed; then two of the creatures squatted down before the entrance--to prevent my escape, doubtless.  Though where I should have escaped to I certainly had not the remotest conception.  I had no more than entered the dark shadows of the interior than there fell upon my ears the tones of a familiar voice, in prayer.  "Perry!" I cried.  "Dear old Perry!  Thank the Lord you are safe."  "David!  Can it be possible that you escaped?" And the old man stumbled toward me and threw his arms about me.  He had seen me fall before the dyryth, and then he had been seized by a number of the ape-creatures and borne through the tree tops to their village.  His captors had been as inquisitive as to his strange clothing as had mine, with the same result.  As we looked at each other we could not help but laugh.  "With a tail, David," remarked Perry, "you would make a very handsome ape."  "Maybe we can borrow a couple," I rejoined.  "They seem to be quite the thing this season.  I wonder what the creatures intend doing with us, Perry.  They don't seem really savage.  What do you suppose they can be?  You were about to tell me where we are when that great hairy frigate bore down upon us--have you really any idea at all?"  "Yes, David," he replied, "I know precisely where we are.  We have made a magnificent discovery, my boy!  We have proved that the earth is hollow.  We have passed entirely through its crust to the inner world."  "Perry, you are mad!"  "Not at all, David.  For two hundred and fifty miles our prospector bore us through the crust beneath our outer world.  At that point it reached the center of gravity of the five-hundred-mile-thick crust.  Up to that point we had been descending--direction is, of course, merely relative.  Then at the moment that our seats revolved--the thing that made you believe that we had turned about and were speeding upward--we passed the center of gravity and, though we did not alter the direction of our progress, yet we were in reality moving upward--toward the surface of the inner world. Does not the strange fauna and flora which we have seen convince you that you are not in the world of your birth?  And the horizon--could it present the strange aspects which we both noted unless we were indeed standing upon the inside surface of a sphere?"  "But the sun, Perry!" I urged.  "How in the world can the sun shine through five hundred miles of solid crust?"  "It is not the sun of the outer world that we see here.  It is another sun--an entirely different sun--that casts its eternal noonday effulgence upon the face of the inner world.  Look at it now, David--if you can see it from the doorway of this hut--and you will see that it is still in the exact center of the heavens. We have been here for many hours--yet it is still noon.  "And withal it is very simple, David.  The earth was once a nebulous mass.  It cooled, and as it cooled it shrank.  At length a thin crust of solid matter formed upon its outer surface--a sort of shell; but within it was partially molten matter and highly expanded gases.  As it continued to cool, what happened?  Centrifugal force hurled the particles of the nebulous center toward the crust as rapidly as they approached a solid state.  You have seen the same principle practically applied in the modern cream separator. Presently there was only a small super-heated core of gaseous matter remaining within a huge vacant interior left by the contraction of the cooling gases.  The equal attraction of the solid crust from all directions maintained this luminous core in the exact center of the hollow globe.  What remains of it is the sun you saw today--a relatively tiny thing at the exact center of the earth.  Equally to every part of this inner world it diffuses its perpetual noonday light and torrid heat.  "This inner world must have cooled sufficiently to support animal life long ages after life appeared upon the outer crust, but that the same agencies were at work here is evident from the similar forms of both animal and vegetable creation which we have already seen.  Take the great beast which attacked us, for example. Unquestionably a counterpart of the Megatherium of the post-Pliocene period of the outer crust, whose fossilized skeleton has been found in South America."  "But the grotesque inhabitants of this forest?" I urged.  "Surely they have no counterpart in the earth's history."  "Who can tell?" he rejoined.  "They may constitute the link between ape and man, all traces of which have been swallowed by the countless convulsions which have racked the outer crust, or they may be merely the result of evolution along slightly different lines--either is quite possible."  Further speculation was interrupted by the appearance of several of our captors before the entrance of the hut.  Two of them entered and dragged us forth.  The perilous pathways and the surrounding trees were filled with the black ape-men, their females, and their young.  There was not an ornament, a weapon, or a garment among the lot.  "Quite low in the scale of creation," commented Perry.  "Quite high enough to play the deuce with us, though," I replied. "Now what do you suppose they intend doing with us?"  We were not long in learning.  As on the occasion of our trip to the village we were seized by a couple of the powerful creatures and whirled away through the tree tops, while about us and in our wake raced a chattering, jabbering, grinning horde of sleek, black ape-things.  Twice my bearers missed their footing, and my heart ceased beating as we plunged toward instant death among the tangled deadwood beneath. But on both occasions those lithe, powerful tails reached out and found sustaining branches, nor did either of the creatures loosen their grasp upon me.  In fact, it seemed that the incidents were of no greater moment to them than would be the stubbing of one's toe at a street crossing in the outer world--they but laughed uproariously and sped on with me.  For some time they continued through the forest--how long I could not guess for I was learning, what was later borne very forcefully to my mind, that time ceases to be a factor the moment means for measuring it cease to exist.  Our watches were gone, and we were living beneath a stationary sun.  Already I was puzzled to compute the period of time which had elapsed since we broke through the crust of the inner world.  It might be hours, or it might be days--who in the world could tell where it was always noon!  By the sun, no time had elapsed--but my judgment told me that we must have been several hours in this strange world.  Presently the forest terminated, and we came out upon a level plain. A short distance before us rose a few low, rocky hills.  Toward these our captors urged us, and after a short time led us through a narrow pass into a tiny, circular valley.  Here they got down to work, and we were soon convinced that if we were not to die to make a Roman holiday, we were to die for some other purpose.  The attitude of our captors altered immediately as they entered the natural arena within the rocky hills.  Their laughter ceased.  Grim ferocity marked their bestial faces--bared fangs menaced us.  We were placed in the center of the amphitheater--the thousand creatures forming a great ring about us.  Then a wolf-dog was brought--hyaenadon Perry called it--and turned loose with us inside the circle.  The thing's body was as large as that of a full-grown mastiff, its legs were short and powerful, and its jaws broad and strong.  Dark, shaggy hair covered its back and sides, while its breast and belly were quite white.  As it slunk toward us it presented a most formidable aspect with its upcurled lips baring its mighty fangs.  Perry was on his knees, praying.  I stooped and picked up a small stone.  At my movement the beast veered off a bit and commenced circling us.  Evidently it had been a target for stones before. The ape-things were dancing up and down urging the brute on with savage cries, until at last, seeing that I did not throw, he charged us.  At Andover, and later at Yale, I had pitched on winning ball teams. My speed and control must both have been above the ordinary, for I made such a record during my senior year at college that overtures were made to me in behalf of one of the great major-league teams; but in the tightest pitch that ever had confronted me in the past I had never been in such need for control as now.  As I wound up for the delivery, I held my nerves and muscles under absolute command, though the grinning jaws were hurtling toward me at terrific speed.  And then I let go, with every ounce of my weight and muscle and science in back of that throw.  The stone caught the hyaenodon full upon the end of the nose, and sent him bowling over upon his back.  At the same instant a chorus of shrieks and howls arose from the circle of spectators, so that for a moment I thought that the upsetting of their champion was the cause; but in this I soon saw that I was mistaken.  As I looked, the ape-things broke in all directions toward the surrounding hills, and then I distinguished the real cause of their perturbation.  Behind them, streaming through the pass which leads into the valley, came a swarm of hairy men--gorilla-like creatures armed with spears and hatchets, and bearing long, oval shields.  Like demons they set upon the ape-things, and before them the hyaenodon, which had now regained its senses and its feet, fled howling with fright.  Past us swept the pursued and the pursuers, nor did the hairy ones accord us more than a passing glance until the arena had been emptied of its former occupants.  Then they returned to us, and one who seemed to have authority among them directed that we be brought with them.  When we had passed out of the amphitheater onto the great plain we saw a caravan of men and women--human beings like ourselves--and for the first time hope and relief filled my heart, until I could have cried out in the exuberance of my happiness.  It is true that they were a half-naked, wild-appearing aggregation; but they at least were fashioned along the same lines as ourselves--there was nothing grotesque or horrible about them as about the other creatures in this strange, weird world.  But as we came closer, our hearts sank once more, for we discovered that the poor wretches were chained neck to neck in a long line, and that the gorilla-men were their guards.  With little ceremony Perry and I were chained at the end of the line, and without further ado the interrupted march was resumed.  Up to this time the excitement had kept us both up; but now the tiresome monotony of the long march across the sun-baked plain brought on all the agonies consequent to a long-denied sleep.  On and on we stumbled beneath that hateful noonday sun.  If we fell we were prodded with a sharp point.  Our companions in chains did not stumble.  They strode along proudly erect.  Occasionally they would exchange words with one another in a monosyllabic language. They were a noble-appearing race with well-formed heads and perfect physiques.  The men were heavily bearded, tall and muscular; the women, smaller and more gracefully molded, with great masses of raven hair caught into loose knots upon their heads.  The features of both sexes were well proportioned--there was not a face among them that would have been called even plain if judged by earthly standards.  They wore no ornaments; but this I later learned was due to the fact that their captors had stripped them of everything of value.  As garmenture the women possessed a single robe of some light-colored, spotted hide, rather similar in appearance to a leopard's skin.  This they wore either supported entirely about the waist by a leathern thong, so that it hung partially below the knee on one side, or possibly looped gracefully across one shoulder. Their feet were shod with skin sandals.  The men wore loin cloths of the hide of some shaggy beast, long ends of which depended before and behind nearly to the ground.  In some instances these ends were finished with the strong talons of the beast from which the hides had been taken.  Our guards, whom I already have described as gorilla-like men, were rather lighter in build than a gorilla, but even so they were indeed mighty creatures.  Their arms and legs were proportioned more in conformity with human standards, but their entire bodies were covered with shaggy, brown hair, and their faces were quite as brutal as those of the few stuffed specimens of the gorilla which I had seen in the museums at home.  Their only redeeming feature lay in the development of the head above and back of the ears.  In this respect they were not one whit less human than we.  They were clothed in a sort of tunic of light cloth which reached to the knees.  Beneath this they wore only a loin cloth of the same material, while their feet were shod with thick hide of some mammoth creature of this inner world.  Their arms and necks were encircled by many ornaments of metal--silver predominating--and on their tunics were sewn the heads of tiny reptiles in odd and rather artistic designs.  They talked among themselves as they marched along on either side of us, but in a language which I perceived differed from that employed by our fellow prisoners.  When they addressed the latter they used what appeared to be a third language, and which I later learned is a mongrel tongue rather analogous to the Pidgin-English of the Chinese coolie.  How far we marched I have no conception, nor has Perry.  Both of us were asleep much of the time for hours before a halt was called--then we dropped in our tracks.  I say "for hours," but how may one measure time where time does not exist!  When our march commenced the sun stood at zenith.  When we halted our shadows still pointed toward nadir.  Whether an instant or an eternity of earthly time elapsed who may say.  That march may have occupied nine years and eleven months of the ten years that I spent in the inner world, or it may have been accomplished in the fraction of a second--I cannot tell.  But this I do know that since you have told me that ten years have elapsed since I departed from this earth I have lost all respect for time--I am commencing to doubt that such a thing exists other than in the weak, finite mind of man.    IV  DIAN THE BEAUTIFUL   WHEN OUR GUARDS AROUSED US FROM SLEEP WE were much refreshed.  They gave us food.  Strips of dried meat it was, but it put new life and strength into us, so that now we too marched with high-held heads, and took noble strides.  At least I did, for I was young and proud; but poor Perry hated walking.  On earth I had often seen him call a cab to travel a square--he was paying for it now, and his old legs wobbled so that I put my arm about him and half carried him through the balance of those frightful marches.  The country began to change at last, and we wound up out of the level plain through mighty mountains of virgin granite.  The tropical verdure of the lowlands was replaced by hardier vegetation, but even here the effects of constant heat and light were apparent in the immensity of the trees and the profusion of foliage and blooms. Crystal streams roared through their rocky channels, fed by the perpetual snows which we could see far above us.  Above the snowcapped heights hung masses of heavy clouds.  It was these, Perry explained, which evidently served the double purpose of replenishing the melting snows and protecting them from the direct rays of the sun.  By this time we had picked up a smattering of the bastard language in which our guards addressed us, as well as making good headway in the rather charming tongue of our co-captives. Directly ahead of me in the chain gang was a young woman.  Three feet of chain linked us together in a forced companionship which I, at least, soon rejoiced in.  For I found her a willing teacher, and from her I learned the language of her tribe, and much of the life and customs of the inner world--at least that part of it with which she was familiar.  She told me that she was called Dian the Beautiful, and that she belonged to the tribe of Amoz, which dwells in the cliffs above the Darel Az, or shallow sea.  "How came you here?" I asked her.  "I was running away from Jubal the Ugly One," she answered, as though that was explanation quite sufficient.  "Who is Jubal the Ugly One?" I asked.  "And why did you run away from him?"  She looked at me in surprise.  "Why DOES a woman run away from a man?" she answered my question with another.  "They do not, where I come from," I replied.  "Sometimes they run after them."  But she could not understand.  Nor could I get her to grasp the fact that I was of another world.  She was quite as positive that creation was originated solely to produce her own kind and the world she lived in as are many of the outer world.  "But Jubal," I insisted.  "Tell me about him, and why you ran away to be chained by the neck and scourged across the face of a world."  "Jubal the Ugly One placed his trophy before my father's house.  It was the head of a mighty tandor.  It remained there and no greater trophy was placed beside it.  So I knew that Jubal the Ugly One would come and take me as his mate.  None other so powerful wished me, or they would have slain a mightier beast and thus have won me from Jubal.  My father is not a mighty hunter.  Once he was, but a sadok tossed him, and never again had he the full use of his right arm.  My brother, Dacor the Strong One, had gone to the land of Sari to steal a mate for himself.  Thus there was none, father, brother, or lover, to save me from Jubal the Ugly One, and I ran away and hid among the hills that skirt the land of Amoz.  And there these Sagoths found me and made me captive."  "What will they do with you?" I asked.  "Where are they taking us?"  Again she looked her incredulity.  "I can almost believe that you are of another world," she said, "for otherwise such ignorance were inexplicable.  Do you really mean that you do not know that the Sagoths are the creatures of the Mahars--the mighty Mahars who think they own Pellucidar and all that walks or grows upon its surface, or creeps or burrows beneath, or swims within its lakes and oceans, or flies through its air?  Next you will be telling me that you never before heard of the Mahars!"  I was loath to do it, and further incur her scorn; but there was no alternative if I were to absorb knowledge, so I made a clean breast of my pitiful ignorance as to the mighty Mahars.  She was shocked.  But she did her very best to enlighten me, though much that she said was as Greek would have been to her.  She described the Mahars largely by comparisons.  In this way they were like unto thipdars, in that to the hairless lidi.  About all I gleaned of them was that they were quite hideous, had wings, and webbed feet; lived in cities built beneath the ground; could swim under water for great distances, and were very, very wise.  The Sagoths were their weapons of offense and defense, and the races like herself were their hands and feet--they were the slaves and servants who did all the manual labor.  The Mahars were the heads--the brains--of the inner world.  I longed to see this wondrous race of supermen.  Perry learned the language with me.  When we halted, as we occasionally did, though sometimes the halts seemed ages apart, he would join in the conversation, as would Ghak the Hairy One, he who was chained just ahead of Dian the Beautiful.  Ahead of Ghak was Hooja the Sly One.  He too entered the conversation occasionally. Most of his remarks were directed toward Dian the Beautiful.  It didn't take half an eye to see that he had developed a bad case; but the girl appeared totally oblivious to his thinly veiled advances. Did I say thinly veiled?  There is a race of men in New Zealand, or Australia, I have forgotten which, who indicate their preference for the lady of their affections by banging her over the head with a bludgeon.  By comparison with this method Hooja's lovemaking might be called thinly veiled.  At first it caused me to blush violently although I have seen several Old Years out at Rectors, and in other less fashionable places off Broadway, and in Vienna, and Hamburg.  But the girl!  She was magnificent.  It was easy to see that she considered herself as entirely above and apart from her present surroundings and company.  She talked with me, and with Perry, and with the taciturn Ghak because we were respectful; but she couldn't even see Hooja the Sly One, much less hear him, and that made him furious.  He tried to get one of the Sagoths to move the girl up ahead of him in the slave gang, but the fellow only poked him with his spear and told him that he had selected the girl for his own property--that he would buy her from the Mahars as soon as they reached Phutra.  Phutra, it seemed, was the city of our destination.  After passing over the first chain of mountains we skirted a salt sea, upon whose bosom swam countless horrid things.  Seal-like creatures there were with long necks stretching ten and more feet above their enormous bodies and whose snake heads were split with gaping mouths bristling with countless fangs.  There were huge tortoises too, paddling about among these other reptiles, which Perry said were Plesiosaurs of the Lias.  I didn't question his veracity--they might have been most anything.  Dian told me they were tandorazes, or tandors of the sea, and that the other, and more fearsome reptiles, which occasionally rose from the deep to do battle with them, were azdyryths, or sea-dyryths--Perry called them Ichthyosaurs.  They resembled a whale with the head of an alligator.  I had forgotten what little geology I had studied at school--about all that remained was an impression of horror that the illustrations of restored prehistoric monsters had made upon me, and a well-defined belief that any man with a pig's shank and a vivid imagination could "restore" most any sort of paleolithic monster he saw fit, and take rank as a first class paleontologist.  But when I saw these sleek, shiny carcasses shimmering in the sunlight as they emerged from the ocean, shaking their giant heads; when I saw the waters roll from their sinuous bodies in miniature waterfalls as they glided hither and thither, now upon the surface, now half submerged; as I saw them meet, open-mouthed, hissing and snorting, in their titanic and interminable warring I realized how futile is man's poor, weak imagination by comparison with Nature's incredible genius.  And Perry!  He was absolutely flabbergasted.  He said so himself.  "David," he remarked, after we had marched for a long time beside that awful sea.  "David, I used to teach geology, and I thought that I believed what I taught; but now I see that I did not believe it--that it is impossible for man to believe such things as these unless he sees them with his own eyes.  We take things for granted, perhaps, because we are told them over and over again, and have no way of disproving them--like religions, for example; but we don't believe them, we only think we do.  If you ever get back to the outer world you will find that the geologists and paleontologists will be the first to set you down a liar, for they know that no such creatures as they restore ever existed.  It is all right to IMAGINE them as existing in an equally imaginary epoch--but now? poof!"  At the next halt Hooja the Sly One managed to find enough slack chain to permit him to worm himself back quite close to Dian.  We were all standing, and as he edged near the girl she turned her back upon him in such a truly earthly feminine manner that I could scarce repress a smile; but it was a short-lived smile for on the instant the Sly One's hand fell upon the girl's bare arm, jerking her roughly toward him.  I was not then familiar with the customs or social ethics which prevailed within Pellucidar; but even so I did not need the appealing look which the girl shot to me from her magnificent eyes to influence my subsequent act.  What the Sly One's intention was I paused not to inquire; but instead, before he could lay hold of her with his other hand, I placed a right to the point of his jaw that felled him in his tracks.  A roar of approval went up from those of the other prisoners and the Sagoths who had witnessed the brief drama; not, as I later learned, because I had championed the girl, but for the neat and, to them, astounding method by which I had bested Hooja.  And the girl?  At first she looked at me with wide, wondering eyes, and then she dropped her head, her face half averted, and a delicate flush suffused her cheek.  For a moment she stood thus in silence, and then her head went high, and she turned her back upon me as she had upon Hooja.  Some of the prisoners laughed, and I saw the face of Ghak the Hairy One go very black as he looked at me searchingly.  And what I could see of Dian's cheek went suddenly from red to white.  Immediately after we resumed the march, and though I realized that in some way I had offended Dian the Beautiful I could not prevail upon her to talk with me that I might learn wherein I had erred--in fact I might quite as well have been addressing a sphinx for all the attention I got.  At last my own foolish pride stepped in and prevented my making any further attempts, and thus a companionship that without my realizing it had come to mean a great deal to me was cut off.  Thereafter I confined my conversation to Perry.  Hooja did not renew his advances toward the girl, nor did he again venture near me.  Again the weary and apparently interminable marching became a perfect nightmare of horrors to me.  The more firmly fixed became the realization that the girl's friendship had meant so much to me, the more I came to miss it; and the more impregnable the barrier of silly pride.  But I was very young and would not ask Ghak for the explanation which I was sure he could give, and that might have made everything all right again.  On the march, or during halts, Dian refused consistently to notice me--when her eyes wandered in my direction she looked either over my head or directly through me.  At last I became desperate, and determined to swallow my self-esteem, and again beg her to tell me how I had offended, and how I might make reparation.  I made up my mind that I should do this at the next halt.  We were approaching another range of mountains at the time, and when we reached them, instead of winding across them through some high-flung pass we entered a mighty natural tunnel--a series of labyrinthine grottoes, dark as Erebus.  The guards had no torches or light of any description.  In fact we had seen no artificial light or sign of fire since we had entered Pellucidar.  In a land of perpetual noon there is no need of light above ground, yet I marveled that they had no means of lighting their way through these dark, subterranean passages.  So we crept along at a snail's pace, with much stumbling and falling--the guards keeping up a singsong chant ahead of us, interspersed with certain high notes which I found always indicated rough places and turns.  Halts were now more frequent, but I did not wish to speak to Dian until I could see from the expression of her face how she was receiving my apologies.  At last a faint glow ahead forewarned us of the end of the tunnel, for which I for one was devoutly thankful. Then at a sudden turn we emerged into the full light of the noonday sun.  But with it came a sudden realization of what meant to me a real catastrophe--Dian was gone, and with her a half-dozen other prisoners.  The guards saw it too, and the ferocity of their rage was terrible to behold.  Their awesome, bestial faces were contorted in the most diabolical expressions, as they accused each other of responsibility for the loss.  Finally they fell upon us, beating us with their spear shafts, and hatchets.  They had already killed two near the head of the line, and were like to have finished the balance of us when their leader finally put a stop to the brutal slaughter.  Never in all my life had I witnessed a more horrible exhibition of bestial rage--I thanked God that Dian had not been one of those left to endure it.  Of the twelve prisoners who had been chained ahead of me each alternate one had been freed commencing with Dian.  Hooja was gone. Ghak remained.  What could it mean?  How had it been accomplished? The commander of the guards was investigating.  Soon he discovered that the rude locks which had held the neckbands in place had been deftly picked.  "Hooja the Sly One," murmured Ghak, who was now next to me in line. "He has taken the girl that you would not have," he continued, glancing at me.  "That I would not have!" I cried.  "What do you mean?"  He looked at me closely for a moment.  "I have doubted your story that you are from another world," he said at last, "but yet upon no other grounds could your ignorance of the ways of Pellucidar be explained.  Do you really mean that you do not know that you offended the Beautiful One, and how?"  "I do not know, Ghak," I replied.  "Then shall I tell you.  When a man of Pellucidar intervenes between another man and the woman the other man would have, the woman belongs to the victor.  Dian the Beautiful belongs to you. You should have claimed her or released her.  Had you taken her hand, it would have indicated your desire to make her your mate, and had you raised her hand above her head and then dropped it, it would have meant that you did not wish her for a mate and that you released her from all obligation to you.  By doing neither you have put upon her the greatest affront that a man may put upon a woman.  Now she is your slave.  No man will take her as mate, or may take her honorably, until he shall have overcome you in combat, and men do not choose slave women as their mates--at least not the men of Pellucidar."  "I did not know, Ghak," I cried.  "I did not know.  Not for all Pellucidar would I have harmed Dian the Beautiful by word, or look, or act of mine.  I do not want her as my slave.  I do not want her as my--" but here I stopped.  The vision of that sweet and innocent face floated before me amidst the soft mists of imagination, and where I had on the second believed that I clung only to the memory of a gentle friendship I had lost, yet now it seemed that it would have been disloyalty to her to have said that I did not want Dian the Beautiful as my mate.  I had not thought of her except as a welcome friend in a strange, cruel world.  Even now I did not think that I loved her.  I believe Ghak must have read the truth more in my expression than in my words, for presently he laid his hand upon my shoulder.  "Man of another world," he said, "I believe you.  Lips may lie, but when the heart speaks through the eyes it tells only the truth. Your heart has spoken to me.  I know now that you meant no affront to Dian the Beautiful.  She is not of my tribe; but her mother is my sister.  She does not know it--her mother was stolen by Dian's father who came with many others of the tribe of Amoz to battle with us for our women--the most beautiful women of Pellucidar. Then was her father king of Amoz, and her mother was daughter of the king of Sari--to whose power I, his son, have succeeded.  Dian is the daughter of kings, though her father is no longer king since the sadok tossed him and Jubal the Ugly One wrested his kingship from him.  Because of her lineage the wrong you did her was greatly magnified in the eyes of all who saw it.  She will never forgive you."  I asked Ghak if there was not some way in which I could release the girl from the bondage and ignominy I had unwittingly placed upon her.  "If ever you find her, yes," he answered.  "Merely to raise her hand above her head and drop it in the presence of others is sufficient to release her; but how may you ever find her, you who are doomed to a life of slavery yourself in the buried city of Phutra?"  "Is there no escape?" I asked.  "Hooja the Sly One escaped and took the others with him," replied Ghak.  "But there are no more dark places on the way to Phutra, and once there it is not so easy--the Mahars are very wise.  Even if one escaped from Phutra there are the thipdars--they would find you, and then--" the Hairy One shuddered.  "No, you will never escape the Mahars."  It was a cheerful prospect.  I asked Perry what he thought about it; but he only shrugged his shoulders and continued a longwinded prayer he had been at for some time.  He was wont to say that the only redeeming feature of our captivity was the ample time it gave him for the improvisation of prayers--it was becoming an obsession with him.  The Sagoths had begun to take notice of his habit of declaiming throughout entire marches.  One of them asked him what he was saying--to whom he was talking.  The question gave me an idea, so I answered quickly before Perry could say anything.  "Do not interrupt him," I said.  "He is a very holy man in the world from which we come.  He is speaking to spirits which you cannot see--do not interrupt him or they will spring out of the air upon you and rend you limb from limb--like that," and I jumped toward the great brute with a loud "Boo!" that sent him stumbling backward.  I took a long chance, I realized, but if we could make any capital out of Perry's harmless mania I wanted to make it while the making was prime.  It worked splendidly.  The Sagoths treated us both with marked respect during the balance of the journey, and then passed the word along to their masters, the Mahars.  Two marches after this episode we came to the city of Phutra.  The entrance to it was marked by two lofty towers of granite, which guarded a flight of steps leading to the buried city.  Sagoths were on guard here as well as at a hundred or more other towers scattered about over a large plain.    V  SLAVES   AS WE DESCENDED THE BROAD STAIRCASE WHICH led to the main avenue of Phutra I caught my first sight of the dominant race of the inner world.  Involuntarily I shrank back as one of the creatures approached to inspect us.  A more hideous thing it would be impossible to imagine.  The all-powerful Mahars of Pellucidar are great reptiles, some six or eight feet in length, with long narrow heads and great round eyes.  Their beak-like mouths are lined with sharp, white fangs, and the backs of their huge, lizard bodies are serrated into bony ridges from their necks to the end of their long tails. Their feet are equipped with three webbed toes, while from the fore feet membranous wings, which are attached to their bodies just in front of the hind legs, protrude at an angle of 45 degrees toward the rear, ending in sharp points several feet above their bodies.  I glanced at Perry as the thing passed me to inspect him.  The old man was gazing at the horrid creature with wide astonished eyes. When it passed on, he turned to me.  "A rhamphorhynchus of the Middle Olitic, David," he said, "but, gad, how enormous!  The largest remains we ever have discovered have never indicated a size greater than that attained by an ordinary crow."  As we continued on through the main avenue of Phutra we saw many thousand of the creatures coming and going upon their daily duties. They paid but little attention to us.  Phutra is laid out underground with a regularity that indicates remarkable engineering skill.  It is hewn from solid limestone strata.  The streets are broad and of a uniform height of twenty feet.  At intervals tubes pierce the roof of this underground city, and by means of lenses and reflectors transmit the sunlight, softened and diffused, to dispel what would otherwise be Cimmerian darkness.  In like manner air is introduced.  Perry and I were taken, with Ghak, to a large public building, where one of the Sagoths who had formed our guard explained to a Maharan official the circumstances surrounding our capture.  The method of communication between these two was remarkable in that no spoken words were exchanged.  They employed a species of sign language.  As I was to learn later, the Mahars have no ears, not any spoken language.  Among themselves they communicate by means of what Perry says must be a sixth sense which is cognizant of a fourth dimension.  I never did quite grasp him, though he endeavored to explain it to me upon numerous occasions.  I suggested telepathy, but he said no, that it was not telepathy since they could only communicate when in each others' presence, nor could they talk with the Sagoths or the other inhabitants of Pellucidar by the same method they used to converse with one another.  "What they do," said Perry, "is to project their thoughts into the fourth dimension, when they become appreciable to the sixth sense of their listener.  Do I make myself quite clear?"  "You do not, Perry," I replied.  He shook his head in despair, and returned to his work.  They had set us to carrying a great accumulation of Maharan literature from one apartment to another, and there arranging it upon shelves.  I suggested to Perry that we were in the public library of Phutra, but later, as he commenced to discover the key to their written language, he assured me that we were handling the ancient archives of the race.  During this period my thoughts were continually upon Dian the Beautiful.  I was, of course, glad that she had escaped the Mahars, and the fate that had been suggested by the Sagoth who had threatened to purchase her upon our arrival at Phutra.  I often wondered if the little party of fugitives had been overtaken by the guards who had returned to search for them.  Sometimes I was not so sure but that I should have been more contented to know that Dian was here in Phutra, than to think of her at the mercy of Hooja the Sly One. Ghak, Perry, and I often talked together of possible escape, but the Sarian was so steeped in his lifelong belief that no one could escape from the Mahars except by a miracle, that he was not much aid to us--his attitude was of one who waits for the miracle to come to him.  At my suggestion Perry and I fashioned some swords of scraps of iron which we discovered among some rubbish in the cells where we slept, for we were permitted almost unrestrained freedom of action within the limits of the building to which we had been assigned. So great were the number of slaves who waited upon the inhabitants of Phutra that none of us was apt to be overburdened with work, nor were our masters unkind to us.  We hid our new weapons beneath the skins which formed our beds, and then Perry conceived the idea of making bows and arrows--weapons apparently unknown within Pellucidar.  Next came shields; but these I found it easier to steal from the walls of the outer guardroom of the building.  We had completed these arrangements for our protection after leaving Phutra when the Sagoths who had been sent to recapture the escaped prisoners returned with four of them, of whom Hooja was one.  Dian and two others had eluded them.  It so happened that Hooja was confined in the same building with us.  He told Ghak that he had not seen Dian or the others after releasing them within the dark grotto. What had become of them he had not the faintest conception--they might be wandering yet, lost within the labyrinthine tunnel, if not dead from starvation.  I was now still further apprehensive as to the fate of Dian, and at this time, I imagine, came the first realization that my affection for the girl might be prompted by more than friendship.  During my waking hours she was constantly the subject of my thoughts, and when I slept her dear face haunted my dreams.  More than ever was I determined to escape the Mahars.  "Perry," I confided to the old man, "if I have to search every inch of this diminutive world I am going to find Dian the Beautiful and right the wrong I unintentionally did her."  That was the excuse I made for Perry's benefit.  "Diminutive world!" he scoffed.  "You don't know what you are talking about, my boy," and then he showed me a map of Pellucidar which he had recently discovered among the manuscript he was arranging.  "Look," he cried, pointing to it, "this is evidently water, and all this land.  Do you notice the general configuration of the two areas?  Where the oceans are upon the outer crust, is land here. These relatively small areas of ocean follow the general lines of the continents of the outer world.  "We know that the crust of the globe is 500 miles in thickness; then the inside diameter of Pellucidar must be 7,000 miles, and the superficial area 165,480,000 square miles.  Three-fourths of this is land.  Think of it!  A land area of 124,110,000 square miles! Our own world contains but 53,000,000 square miles of land, the balance of its surface being covered by water.  Just as we often compare nations by their relative land areas, so if we compare these two worlds in the same way we have the strange anomaly of a larger world within a smaller one!  "Where within vast Pellucidar would you search for your Dian? Without stars, or moon, or changing sun how could you find her even though you knew where she might be found?"  The proposition was a corker.  It quite took my breath away; but I found that it left me all the more determined to attempt it.  "If Ghak will accompany us we may be able to do it," I suggested.  Perry and I sought him out and put the question straight to him.  "Ghak," I said, "we are determined to escape from this bondage. Will you accompany us?"  "They will set the thipdars upon us," he said, "and then we shall be killed; but--" he hesitated--"I would take the chance if I thought that I might possibly escape and return to my own people."  "Could you find your way back to your own land?" asked Perry.  "And could you aid David in his search for Dian?"  "Yes."  "But how," persisted Perry, "could you travel to strange country without heavenly bodies or a compass to guide you?"  Ghak didn't know what Perry meant by heavenly bodies or a compass, but he assured us that you might blindfold any man of Pellucidar and carry him to the farthermost corner of the world, yet he would be able to come directly to his own home again by the shortest route. He seemed surprised to think that we found anything wonderful in it.  Perry said it must be some sort of homing instinct such as is possessed by certain breeds of earthly pigeons.  I didn't know, of course, but it gave me an idea.  "Then Dian could have found her way directly to her own people?" I asked.  "Surely," replied Ghak, "unless some mighty beast of prey killed her."  I was for making the attempted escape at once, but both Perry and Ghak counseled waiting for some propitious accident which would insure us some small degree of success.  I didn't see what accident could befall a whole community in a land of perpetual daylight where the inhabitants had no fixed habits of sleep.  Why, I am sure that some of the Mahars never sleep, while others may, at long intervals, crawl into the dark recesses beneath their dwellings and curl up in protracted slumber.  Perry says that if a Mahar stays awake for three years he will make up all his lost sleep in a long year's snooze.  That may be all true, but I never saw but three of them asleep, and it was the sight of these three that gave me a suggestion for our means of escape.  I had been searching about far below the levels that we slaves were supposed to frequent--possibly fifty feet beneath the main floor of the building--among a network of corridors and apartments, when I came suddenly upon three Mahars curled up upon a bed of skins.  At first I thought they were dead, but later their regular breathing convinced me of my error.  Like a flash the thought came to me of the marvelous opportunity these sleeping reptiles offered as a means of eluding the watchfulness of our captors and the Sagoth guards.  Hastening back to Perry where he pored over a musty pile of, to me, meaningless hieroglyphics, I explained my plan to him.  To my surprise he was horrified.  "It would be murder, David," he cried.  "Murder to kill a reptilian monster?" I asked in astonishment.  "Here they are not monsters, David," he replied.  "Here they are the dominant race--we are the 'monsters'--the lower orders.  In Pellucidar evolution has progressed along different lines than upon the outer earth.  These terrible convulsions of nature time and time again wiped out the existing species--but for this fact some monster of the Saurozoic epoch might rule today upon our own world.  We see here what might well have occurred in our own history had conditions been what they have been here.  "Life within Pellucidar is far younger than upon the outer crust. Here man has but reached a stage analogous to the Stone Age of our own world's history, but for countless millions of years these reptiles have been progressing.  Possibly it is the sixth sense which I am sure they possess that has given them an advantage over the other and more frightfully armed of their fellows; but this we may never know.  They look upon us as we look upon the beasts of our fields, and I learn from their written records that other races of Mahars feed upon men--they keep them in great droves, as we keep cattle.  They breed them most carefully, and when they are quite fat, they kill and eat them."  I shuddered.  "What is there horrible about it, David?" the old man asked.  "They understand us no better than we understand the lower animals of our own world.  Why, I have come across here very learned discussions of the question as to whether gilaks, that is men, have any means of communication.  One writer claims that we do not even reason--that our every act is mechanical, or instinctive.  The dominant race of Pellucidar, David, have not yet learned that men converse among themselves, or reason.  Because we do not converse as they do it is beyond them to imagine that we converse at all.  It is thus that we reason in relation to the brutes of our own world.  They know that the Sagoths have a spoken language, but they cannot comprehend it, or how it manifests itself, since they have no auditory apparatus. They believe that the motions of the lips alone convey the meaning. That the Sagoths can communicate with us is incomprehensible to them.  "Yes, David," he concluded, "it would entail murder to carry out your plan."  "Very well then, Perry." I replied.  "I shall become a murderer."  He got me to go over the plan again most carefully, and for some reason which was not at the time clear to me insisted upon a very careful description of the apartments and corridors I had just explored.  "I wonder, David," he said at length, "as you are determined to carry out your wild scheme, if we could not accomplish something of very real and lasting benefit for the human race of Pellucidar at the same time.  Listen, I have learned much of a most surprising nature from these archives of the Mahars.  That you may not appreciate my plan I shall briefly outline the history of the race.  "Once the males were all-powerful, but ages ago the females, little by little, assumed the mastery.  For other ages no noticeable change took place in the race of Mahars.  It continued to progress under the intelligent and beneficent rule of the ladies.  Science took vast strides.  This was especially true of the sciences which we know as biology and eugenics.  Finally a certain female scientist announced the fact that she had discovered a method whereby eggs might be fertilized by chemical means after they were laid--all true reptiles, you know, are hatched from eggs.  "What happened?  Immediately the necessity for males ceased to exist--the race was no longer dependent upon them.  More ages elapsed until at the present time we find a race consisting exclusively of females.  But here is the point.  The secret of this chemical formula is kept by a single race of Mahars.  It is in the city of Phutra, and unless I am greatly in error I judge from your description of the vaults through which you passed today that it lies hidden in the cellar of this building.  "For two reasons they hide it away and guard it jealously.  First, because upon it depends the very life of the race of Mahars, and second, owing to the fact that when it was public property as at first so many were experimenting with it that the danger of over-population became very grave.  "David, if we can escape, and at the same time take with us this great secret what will we not have accomplished for the human race within Pellucidar!" The very thought of it fairly overpowered me. Why, we two would be the means of placing the men of the inner world in their rightful place among created things.  Only the Sagoths would then stand between them and absolute supremacy, and I was not quite sure but that the Sagoths owed all their power to the greater intelligence of the Mahars--I could not believe that these gorilla-like beasts were the mental superiors of the human race of Pellucidar.  "Why, Perry," I exclaimed, "you and I may reclaim a whole world! Together we can lead the races of men out of the darkness of ignorance into the light of advancement and civilization.  At one step we may carry them from the Age of Stone to the twentieth century.  It's marvelous--absolutely marvelous just to think about it."  "David," said the old man, "I believe that God sent us here for just that purpose--it shall be my life work to teach them His word--to lead them into the light of His mercy while we are training their hearts and hands in the ways of culture and civilization."  "You are right, Perry," I said, "and while you are teaching them to pray I'll be teaching them to fight, and between us we'll make a race of men that will be an honor to us both."  Ghak had entered the apartment some time before we concluded our conversation, and now he wanted to know what we were so excited about.  Perry thought we had best not tell him too much, and so I only explained that I had a plan for escape.  When I had outlined it to him, he seemed about as horror-struck as Perry had been; but for a different reason.  The Hairy One only considered the horrible fate that would be ours were we discovered; but at last I prevailed upon him to accept my plan as the only feasible one, and when I had assured him that I would take all the responsibility for it were we captured, he accorded a reluctant assent.    VI  THE BEGINNING OF HORROR   WITHIN PELLUCIDAR ONE TIME IS AS GOOD AS ANOTHER.  There were no nights to mask our attempted escape.  All must be done in broad daylight--all but the work I had to do in the apartment beneath the building.  So we determined to put our plan to an immediate test lest the Mahars who made it possible should awake before I reached them; but we were doomed to disappointment, for no sooner had we reached the main floor of the building on our way to the pits beneath, than we encountered hurrying bands of slaves being hastened under strong Sagoth guard out of the edifice to the avenue beyond.  Other Sagoths were darting hither and thither in search of other slaves, and the moment that we appeared we were pounced upon and hustled into the line of marching humans.  What the purpose or nature of the general exodus we did not know, but presently through the line of captives ran the rumor that two escaped slaves had been recaptured--a man and a woman--and that we were marching to witness their punishment, for the man had killed a Sagoth of the detachment that had pursued and overtaken them.  At the intelligence my heart sprang to my throat, for I was sure that the two were of those who escaped in the dark grotto with Hooja the Sly One, and that Dian must be the woman.  Ghak thought so too, as did Perry.  "Is there naught that we may do to save her?" I asked Ghak.  "Naught," he replied.  Along the crowded avenue we marched, the guards showing unusual cruelty toward us, as though we, too, had been implicated in the murder of their fellow.  The occasion was to serve as an object-lesson to all other slaves of the danger and futility of attempted escape, and the fatal consequences of taking the life of a superior being, and so I imagine that Sagoths felt amply justified in making the entire proceeding as uncomfortable and painful to us as possible.  They jabbed us with their spears and struck at us with the hatchets at the least provocation, and at no provocation at all.  It was a most uncomfortable half-hour that we spent before we were finally herded through a low entrance into a huge building the center of which was given up to a good-sized arena.  Benches surrounded this open space upon three sides, and along the fourth were heaped huge bowlders which rose in receding tiers toward the roof.  At first I couldn't make out the purpose of this mighty pile of rock, unless it were intended as a rough and picturesque background for the scenes which were enacted in the arena before it, but presently, after the wooden benches had been pretty well filled by slaves and Sagoths, I discovered the purpose of the bowlders, for then the Mahars began to file into the enclosure.  They marched directly across the arena toward the rocks upon the opposite side, where, spreading their bat-like wings, they rose above the high wall of the pit, settling down upon the bowlders above.  These were the reserved seats, the boxes of the elect.  Reptiles that they are, the rough surface of a great stone is to them as plush as upholstery to us.  Here they lolled, blinking their hideous eyes, and doubtless conversing with one another in their sixth-sense-fourth-dimension language.  For the first time I beheld their queen.  She differed from the others in no feature that was appreciable to my earthly eyes, in fact all Mahars look alike to me: but when she crossed the arena after the balance of her female subjects had found their bowlders, she was preceded by a score of huge Sagoths, the largest I ever had seen, and on either side of her waddled a huge thipdar, while behind came another score of Sagoth guardsmen.  At the barrier the Sagoths clambered up the steep side with truly apelike agility, while behind them the haughty queen rose upon her wings with her two frightful dragons close beside her, and settled down upon the largest bowlder of them all in the exact center of that side of the amphitheater which is reserved for the dominant race.  Here she squatted, a most repulsive and uninteresting queen; though doubtless quite as well assured of her beauty and divine right to rule as the proudest monarch of the outer world.  And then the music started--music without sound!  The Mahars cannot hear, so the drums and fifes and horns of earthly bands are unknown among them.  The "band" consists of a score or more Mahars.  It filed out in the center of the arena where the creatures upon the rocks might see it, and there it performed for fifteen or twenty minutes.  Their technic consisted in waving their tails and moving their heads in a regular succession of measured movements resulting in a cadence which evidently pleased the eye of the Mahar as the cadence of our own instrumental music pleases our ears.  Sometimes the band took measured steps in unison to one side or the other, or backward and again forward--it all seemed very silly and meaningless to me, but at the end of the first piece the Mahars upon the rocks showed the first indications of enthusiasm that I had seen displayed by the dominant race of Pellucidar.  They beat their great wings up and down, and smote their rocky perches with their mighty tails until the ground shook.  Then the band started another piece, and all was again as silent as the grave.  That was one great beauty about Mahar music--if you didn't happen to like a piece that was being played all you had to do was shut your eyes.  When the band had exhausted its repertory it took wing and settled upon the rocks above and behind the queen.  Then the business of the day was on.  A man and woman were pushed into the arena by a couple of Sagoth guardsmen.  I leaned forward in my seat to scrutinize the female--hoping against hope that she might prove to be another than Dian the Beautiful.  Her back was toward me for a while, and the sight of the great mass of raven hair piled high upon her head filled me with alarm.  Presently a door in one side of the arena wall was opened to admit a huge, shaggy, bull-like creature.  "A Bos," whispered Perry, excitedly.  "His kind roamed the outer crust with the cave bear and the mammoth ages and ages ago.  We have been carried back a million years, David, to the childhood of a planet--is it not wondrous?"  But I saw only the raven hair of a half-naked girl, and my heart stood still in dumb misery at the sight of her, nor had I any eyes for the wonders of natural history.  But for Perry and Ghak I should have leaped to the floor of the arena and shared whatever fate lay in store for this priceless treasure of the Stone Age.  With the advent of the Bos--they call the thing a thag within Pellucidar--two spears were tossed into the arena at the feet of the prisoners.  It seemed to me that a bean shooter would have been as effective against the mighty monster as these pitiful weapons.  As the animal approached the two, bellowing and pawing the ground with the strength of many earthly bulls, another door directly beneath us was opened, and from it issued the most terrific roar that ever had fallen upon my outraged ears.  I could not at first see the beast from which emanated this fearsome challenge, but the sound had the effect of bringing the two victims around with a sudden start, and then I saw the girl's face--she was not Dian! I could have wept for relief.  And now, as the two stood frozen in terror, I saw the author of that fearsome sound creeping stealthily into view.  It was a huge tiger--such as hunted the great Bos through the jungles primeval when the world was young.  In contour and markings it was not unlike the noblest of the Bengals of our own world, but as its dimensions were exaggerated to colossal proportions so too were its colorings exaggerated.  Its vivid yellows fairly screamed aloud; its whites were as eider down; its blacks glossy as the finest anthracite coal, and its coat long and shaggy as a mountain goat.  That it is a beautiful animal there is no gainsaying, but if its size and colors are magnified here within Pellucidar, so is the ferocity of its disposition.  It is not the occasional member of its species that is a man hunter--all are man hunters; but they do not confine their foraging to man alone, for there is no flesh or fish within Pellucidar that they will not eat with relish in the constant efforts which they make to furnish their huge carcasses with sufficient sustenance to maintain their mighty thews.  Upon one side of the doomed pair the thag bellowed and advanced, and upon the other tarag, the frightful, crept toward them with gaping mouth and dripping fangs.  The man seized the spears, handing one of them to the woman.  At the sound of the roaring of the tiger the bull's bellowing became a veritable frenzy of rageful noise.  Never in my life had I heard such an infernal din as the two brutes made, and to think it was all lost upon the hideous reptiles for whom the show was staged!  The thag was charging now from one side, and the tarag from the other.  The two puny things standing between them seemed already lost, but at the very moment that the beasts were upon them the man grasped his companion by the arm and together they leaped to one side, while the frenzied creatures came together like locomotives in collision.  There ensued a battle royal which for sustained and frightful ferocity transcends the power of imagination or description.  Time and again the colossal bull tossed the enormous tiger high into the air, but each time that the huge cat touched the ground he returned to the encounter with apparently undiminished strength, and seemingly increased ire.  For a while the man and woman busied themselves only with keeping out of the way of the two creatures, but finally I saw them separate and each creep stealthily toward one of the combatants.  The tiger was now upon the bull's broad back, clinging to the huge neck with powerful fangs while its long, strong talons ripped the heavy hide into shreds and ribbons.  For a moment the bull stood bellowing and quivering with pain and rage, its cloven hoofs widespread, its tail lashing viciously from side to side, and then, in a mad orgy of bucking it went careening about the arena in frenzied attempt to unseat its rending rider. It was with difficulty that the girl avoided the first mad rush of the wounded animal.  All its efforts to rid itself of the tiger seemed futile, until in desperation it threw itself upon the ground, rolling over and over.  A little of this so disconcerted the tiger, knocking its breath from it I imagine, that it lost its hold and then, quick as a cat, the great thag was up again and had buried those mighty horns deep in the tarag's abdomen, pinning him to the floor of the arena.  The great cat clawed at the shaggy head until eyes and ears were gone, and naught but a few strips of ragged, bloody flesh remained upon the skull.  Yet through all the agony of that fearful punishment the thag still stood motionless pinning down his adversary, and then the man leaped in, seeing that the blind bull would be the least formidable enemy, and ran his spear through the tarag's heart.  As the animal's fierce clawing ceased, the bull raised his gory, sightless head, and with a horrid roar ran headlong across the arena.  With great leaps and bounds he came, straight toward the arena wall directly beneath where we sat, and then accident carried him, in one of his mighty springs, completely over the barrier into the midst of the slaves and Sagoths just in front of us.  Swinging his bloody horns from side to side the beast cut a wide swath before him straight upward toward our seats.  Before him slaves and gorilla-men fought in mad stampede to escape the menace of the creature's death agonies, for such only could that frightful charge have been.  Forgetful of us, our guards joined in the general rush for the exits, many of which pierced the wall of the amphitheater behind us.  Perry, Ghak, and I became separated in the chaos which reigned for a few moments after the beast cleared the wall of the arena, each intent upon saving his own hide.  I ran to the right, passing several exits choked with the fear mad mob that were battling to escape.  One would have thought that an entire herd of thags was loose behind them, rather than a single blinded, dying beast; but such is the effect of panic upon a crowd.    VII  FREEDOM   ONCE OUT OF THE DIRECT PATH OF THE ANIMAL, fear of it left me, but another emotion as quickly gripped me--hope of escape that the demoralized condition of the guards made possible for the instant.  I thought of Perry, but for the hope that I might better encompass his release if myself free I should have put the thought of freedom from me at once.  As it was I hastened on toward the right searching for an exit toward which no Sagoths were fleeing, and at last I found it--a low, narrow aperture leading into a dark corridor.  Without thought of the possible consequence, I darted into the shadows of the tunnel, feeling my way along through the gloom for some distance.  The noises of the amphitheater had grown fainter and fainter until now all was as silent as the tomb about me.  Faint light filtered from above through occasional ventilating and lighting tubes, but it was scarce sufficient to enable my human eyes to cope with the darkness, and so I was forced to move with extreme care, feeling my way along step by step with a hand upon the wall beside me.  Presently the light increased and a moment later, to my delight, I came upon a flight of steps leading upward, at the top of which the brilliant light of the noonday sun shone through an opening in the ground.  Cautiously I crept up the stairway to the tunnel's end, and peering out saw the broad plain of Phutra before me.  The numerous lofty, granite towers which mark the several entrances to the subterranean city were all in front of me--behind, the plain stretched level and unbroken to the nearby foothills.  I had come to the surface, then, beyond the city, and my chances for escape seemed much enhanced.  My first impulse was to await darkness before attempting to cross the plain, so deeply implanted are habits of thought; but of a sudden I recollected the perpetual noonday brilliance which envelopes Pellucidar, and with a smile I stepped forth into the daylight.  Rank grass, waist high, grows upon the plain of Phutra--the gorgeous flowering grass of the inner world, each particular blade of which is tipped with a tiny, five-pointed blossom--brilliant little stars of varying colors that twinkle in the green foliage to add still another charm to the weird, yet lovely, landscape.  But then the only aspect which attracted me was the distant hills in which I hoped to find sanctuary, and so I hastened on, trampling the myriad beauties beneath my hurrying feet.  Perry says that the force of gravity is less upon the surface of the inner world than upon that of the outer.  He explained it all to me once, but I was never particularly brilliant in such matters and so most of it has escaped me.  As I recall it the difference is due in some part to the counter-attraction of that portion of the earth's crust directly opposite the spot upon the face of Pellucidar at which one's calculations are being made.  Be that as it may, it always seemed to me that I moved with greater speed and agility within Pellucidar than upon the outer surface--there was a certain airy lightness of step that was most pleasing, and a feeling of bodily detachment which I can only compare with that occasionally experienced in dreams.  And as I crossed Phutra's flower-bespangled plain that time I seemed almost to fly, though how much of the sensation was due to Perry's suggestion and how much to actuality I am sure I do not know. The more I thought of Perry the less pleasure I took in my new-found freedom.  There could be no liberty for me within Pellucidar unless the old man shared it with me, and only the hope that I might find some way to encompass his release kept me from turning back to Phutra.  Just how I was to help Perry I could scarce imagine, but I hoped that some fortuitous circumstance might solve the problem for me. It was quite evident however that little less than a miracle could aid me, for what could I accomplish in this strange world, naked and unarmed?  It was even doubtful that I could retrace my steps to Phutra should I once pass beyond view of the plain, and even were that possible, what aid could I bring to Perry no matter how far I wandered?  The case looked more and more hopeless the longer I viewed it, yet with a stubborn persistency I forged ahead toward the foothills. Behind me no sign of pursuit developed, before me I saw no living thing.  It was as though I moved through a dead and forgotten world.  I have no idea, of course, how long it took me to reach the limit of the plain, but at last I entered the foothills, following a pretty little canyon upward toward the mountains.  Beside me frolicked a laughing brooklet, hurrying upon its noisy way down to the silent sea.  In its quieter pools I discovered many small fish, of four-or five-pound weight I should imagine.  In appearance, except as to size and color, they were not unlike the whale of our own seas. As I watched them playing about I discovered, not only that they suckled their young, but that at intervals they rose to the surface to breathe as well as to feed upon certain grasses and a strange, scarlet lichen which grew upon the rocks just above the water line.  It was this last habit that gave me the opportunity I craved to capture one of these herbivorous cetaceans--that is what Perry calls them--and make as good a meal as one can on raw, warm-blooded fish; but I had become rather used, by this time, to the eating of food in its natural state, though I still balked on the eyes and entrails, much to the amusement of Ghak, to whom I always passed these delicacies.  Crouching beside the brook, I waited until one of the diminutive purple whales rose to nibble at the long grasses which overhung the water, and then, like the beast of prey that man really is, I sprang upon my victim, appeasing my hunger while he yet wriggled to escape.  Then I drank from the clear pool, and after washing my hands and face continued my flight.  Above the source of the brook I encountered a rugged climb to the summit of a long ridge.  Beyond was a steep declivity to the shore of a placid, inland sea, upon the quiet surface of which lay several beautiful islands.  The view was charming in the extreme, and as no man or beast was to be seen that might threaten my new-found liberty, I slid over the edge of the bluff, and half sliding, half falling, dropped into the delightful valley, the very aspect of which seemed to offer a haven of peace and security.  The gently sloping beach along which I walked was thickly strewn with strangely shaped, colored shells; some empty, others still housing as varied a multitude of mollusks as ever might have drawn out their sluggish lives along the silent shores of the antediluvian seas of the outer crust.  As I walked I could not but compare myself with the first man of that other world, so complete the solitude which surrounded me, so primal and untouched the virgin wonders and beauties of adolescent nature.  I felt myself a second Adam wending my lonely way through the childhood of a world, searching for my Eve, and at the thought there rose before my mind's eye the exquisite outlines of a perfect face surmounted by a loose pile of wondrous, raven hair.  As I walked, my eyes were bent upon the beach so that it was not until I had come quite upon it that I discovered that which shattered all my beautiful dream of solitude and safety and peace and primal overlordship.  The thing was a hollowed log drawn upon the sands, and in the bottom of it lay a crude paddle.  The rude shock of awakening to what doubtless might prove some new form of danger was still upon me when I heard a rattling of loose stones from the direction of the bluff, and turning my eyes in that direction I beheld the author of the disturbance, a great copper-colored man, running rapidly toward me.  There was that in the haste with which he came which seemed quite sufficiently menacing, so that I did not need the added evidence of brandishing spear and scowling face to warn me that I was in no safe position, but whither to flee was indeed a momentous question.  The speed of the fellow seemed to preclude the possibility of escaping him upon the open beach.  There was but a single alternative--the rude skiff--and with a celerity which equaled his, I pushed the thing into the sea and as it floated gave a final shove and clambered in over the end.  A cry of rage rose from the owner of the primitive craft, and an instant later his heavy, stone-tipped spear grazed my shoulder and buried itself in the bow of the boat beyond.  Then I grasped the paddle, and with feverish haste urged the awkward, wobbly thing out upon the surface of the sea.  A glance over my shoulder showed me that the copper-colored one had plunged in after me and was swimming rapidly in pursuit.  His mighty strokes bade fair to close up the distance between us in short order, for at best I could make but slow progress with my unfamiliar craft, which nosed stubbornly in every direction but that which I desired to follow, so that fully half my energy was expended in turning its blunt prow back into the course.  I had covered some hundred yards from shore when it became evident that my pursuer must grasp the stern of the skiff within the next half-dozen strokes.  In a frenzy of despair, I bent to the grandfather of all paddles in a hopeless effort to escape, and still the copper giant behind me gained and gained.  His hand was reaching upward for the stern when I saw a sleek, sinuous body shoot from the depths below.  The man saw it too, and the look of terror that overspread his face assured me that I need have no further concern as to him, for the fear of certain death was in his look.  And then about him coiled the great, slimy folds of a hideous monster of that prehistoric deep--a mighty serpent of the sea, with fanged jaws, and darting forked tongue, with bulging eyes, and bony protuberances upon head and snout that formed short, stout horns.  As I looked at that hopeless struggle my eyes met those of the doomed man, and I could have sworn that in his I saw an expression of hopeless appeal.  But whether I did or not there swept through me a sudden compassion for the fellow.  He was indeed a brother-man, and that he might have killed me with pleasure had he caught me was forgotten in the extremity of his danger.  Unconsciously I had ceased paddling as the serpent rose to engage my pursuer, so now the skiff still drifted close beside the two. The monster seemed to be but playing with his victim before he closed his awful jaws upon him and dragged him down to his dark den beneath the surface to devour him.  The huge, snakelike body coiled and uncoiled about its prey.  The hideous, gaping jaws snapped in the victim's face.  The forked tongue, lightning-like, ran in and out upon the copper skin.  Nobly the giant battled for his life, beating with his stone hatchet against the bony armor that covered that frightful carcass; but for all the damage he inflicted he might as well have struck with his open palm.  At last I could endure no longer to sit supinely by while a fellowman was dragged down to a horrible death by that repulsive reptile. Embedded in the prow of the skiff lay the spear that had been cast after me by him whom I suddenly desired to save.  With a wrench I tore it loose, and standing upright in the wobbly log drove it with all the strength of my two arms straight into the gaping jaws of the hydrophidian.  With a loud hiss the creature abandoned its prey to turn upon me, but the spear, imbedded in its throat, prevented it from seizing me though it came near to overturning the skiff in its mad efforts to reach me.    VIII  THE MAHAR TEMPLE   THE ABORIGINE, APPARENTLY UNINJURED, CLIMBED quickly into the skiff, and seizing the spear with me helped to hold off the infuriated creature.  Blood from the wounded reptile was now crimsoning the waters about us and soon from the weakening struggles it became evident that I had inflicted a death wound upon it.  Presently its efforts to reach us ceased entirely, and with a few convulsive movements it turned upon its back quite dead.  And then there came to me a sudden realization of the predicament in which I had placed myself.  I was entirely within the power of the savage man whose skiff I had stolen.  Still clinging to the spear I looked into his face to find him scrutinizing me intently, and there we stood for some several minutes, each clinging tenaciously to the weapon the while we gazed in stupid wonderment at each other.  What was in his mind I do not know, but in my own was merely the question as to how soon the fellow would recommence hostilities.  Presently he spoke to me, but in a tongue which I was unable to translate.  I shook my head in an effort to indicate my ignorance of his language, at the same time addressing him in the bastard tongue that the Sagoths use to converse with the human slaves of the Mahars.  To my delight he understood and answered me in the same jargon.  "What do you want of my spear?" he asked.  "Only to keep you from running it through me," I replied.  "I would not do that," he said, "for you have just saved my life," and with that he released his hold upon it and squatted down in the bottom of the skiff.  "Who are you," he continued, "and from what country do you come?"  I too sat down, laying the spear between us, and tried to explain how I came to Pellucidar, and wherefrom, but it was as impossible for him to grasp or believe the strange tale I told him as I fear it is for you upon the outer crust to believe in the existence of the inner world.  To him it seemed quite ridiculous to imagine that there was another world far beneath his feet peopled by beings similar to himself, and he laughed uproariously the more he thought upon it.  But it was ever thus.  That which has never come within the scope of our really pitifully meager world-experience cannot be--our finite minds cannot grasp that which may not exist in accordance with the conditions which obtain about us upon the outside of the insignificant grain of dust which wends its tiny way among the bowlders of the universe--the speck of moist dirt we so proudly call the World.  So I gave it up and asked him about himself.  He said he was a Mezop, and that his name was Ja.  "Who are the Mezops?" I asked.  "Where do they live?"  He looked at me in surprise.  "I might indeed believe that you were from another world," he said, "for who of Pellucidar could be so ignorant!  The Mezops live upon the islands of the seas.  In so far as I ever have heard no Mezop lives elsewhere, and no others than Mezops dwell upon islands, but of course it may be different in other far-distant lands.  I do not know.  At any rate in this sea and those near by it is true that only people of my race inhabit the islands.  "We are fishermen, though we be great hunters as well, often going to the mainland in search of the game that is scarce upon all but the larger islands.  And we are warriors also," he added proudly. "Even the Sagoths of the Mahars fear us.  Once, when Pellucidar was young, the Sagoths were wont to capture us for slaves as they do the other men of Pellucidar, it is handed down from father to son among us that this is so; but we fought so desperately and slew so many Sagoths, and those of us that were captured killed so many Mahars in their own cities that at last they learned that it were better to leave us alone, and later came the time that the Mahars became too indolent even to catch their own fish, except for amusement, and then they needed us to supply their wants, and so a truce was made between the races.  Now they give us certain things which we are unable to produce in return for the fish that we catch, and the Mezops and the Mahars live in peace.  "The great ones even come to our islands.  It is there, far from the prying eyes of their own Sagoths, that they practice their religious rites in the temples they have builded there with our assistance.  If you live among us you will doubtless see the manner of their worship, which is strange indeed, and most unpleasant for the poor slaves they bring to take part in it."  As Ja talked I had an excellent opportunity to inspect him more closely.  He was a huge fellow, standing I should say six feet six or seven inches, well developed and of a coppery red not unlike that of our own North American Indian, nor were his features dissimilar to theirs.  He had the aquiline nose found among many of the higher tribes, the prominent cheek bones, and black hair and eyes, but his mouth and lips were better molded.  All in all, Ja was an impressive and handsome creature, and he talked well too, even in the miserable makeshift language we were compelled to use.  During our conversation Ja had taken the paddle and was propelling the skiff with vigorous strokes toward a large island that lay some half-mile from the mainland.  The skill with which he handled his crude and awkward craft elicited my deepest admiration, since it had been so short a time before that I had made such pitiful work of it.  As we touched the pretty, level beach Ja leaped out and I followed him.  Together we dragged the skiff far up into the bushes that grew beyond the sand.  "We must hide our canoes," explained Ja, "for the Mezops of Luana are always at war with us and would steal them if they found them," he nodded toward an island farther out at sea, and at so great a distance that it seemed but a blur hanging in the distant sky.  The upward curve of the surface of Pellucidar was constantly revealing the impossible to the surprised eyes of the outer-earthly. To see land and water curving upward in the distance until it seemed to stand on edge where it melted into the distant sky, and to feel that seas and mountains hung suspended directly above one's head required such a complete reversal of the perceptive and reasoning faculties as almost to stupefy one.  No sooner had we hidden the canoe than Ja plunged into the jungle, presently emerging into a narrow but well-defined trail which wound hither and thither much after the manner of the highways of all primitive folk, but there was one peculiarity about this Mezop trail which I was later to find distinguished them from all other trails that I ever have seen within or without the earth.  It would run on, plain and clear and well defined to end suddenly in the midst of a tangle of matted jungle, then Ja would turn directly back in his tracks for a little distance, spring into a tree, climb through it to the other side, drop onto a fallen log, leap over a low bush and alight once more upon a distinct trail which he would follow back for a short distance only to turn directly about and retrace his steps until after a mile or less this new pathway ended as suddenly and mysteriously as the former section. Then he would pass again across some media which would reveal no spoor, to take up the broken thread of the trail beyond.  As the purpose of this remarkable avenue dawned upon me I could not but admire the native shrewdness of the ancient progenitor of the Mezops who hit upon this novel plan to throw his enemies from his track and delay or thwart them in their attempts to follow him to his deep-buried cities.  To you of the outer earth it might seem a slow and tortuous method of traveling through the jungle, but were you of Pellucidar you would realize that time is no factor where time does not exist. So labyrinthine are the windings of these trails, so varied the connecting links and the distances which one must retrace one's steps from the paths' ends to find them that a Mezop often reaches man's estate before he is familiar even with those which lead from his own city to the sea.  In fact three-fourths of the education of the young male Mezop consists in familiarizing himself with these jungle avenues, and the status of an adult is largely determined by the number of trails which he can follow upon his own island.  The females never learn them, since from birth to death they never leave the clearing in which the village of their nativity is situated except they be taken to mate by a male from another village, or captured in war by the enemies of their tribe.  After proceeding through the jungle for what must have been upward of five miles we emerged suddenly into a large clearing in the exact center of which stood as strange an appearing village as one might well imagine.  Large trees had been chopped down fifteen or twenty feet above the ground, and upon the tops of them spherical habitations of woven twigs, mud covered, had been built.  Each ball-like house was surmounted by some manner of carven image, which Ja told me indicated the identity of the owner.  Horizontal slits, six inches high and two or three feet wide, served to admit light and ventilation.  The entrances to the house were through small apertures in the bases of the trees and thence upward by rude ladders through the hollow trunks to the rooms above.  The houses varied in size from two to several rooms.  The largest that I entered was divided into two floors and eight apartments.  All about the village, between it and the jungle, lay beautifully cultivated fields in which the Mezops raised such cereals, fruits, and vegetables as they required.  Women and children were working in these gardens as we crossed toward the village.  At sight of Ja they saluted deferentially, but to me they paid not the slightest attention.  Among them and about the outer verge of the cultivated area were many warriors.  These too saluted Ja, by touching the points of their spears to the ground directly before them.  Ja conducted me to a large house in the center of the village--the house with eight rooms--and taking me up into it gave me food and drink.  There I met his mate, a comely girl with a nursing baby in her arms.  Ja told her of how I had saved his life, and she was thereafter most kind and hospitable toward me, even permitting me to hold and amuse the tiny bundle of humanity whom Ja told me would one day rule the tribe, for Ja, it seemed, was the chief of the community.  We had eaten and rested, and I had slept, much to Ja's amusement, for it seemed that he seldom if ever did so, and then the red man proposed that I accompany him to the temple of the Mahars which lay not far from his village.  "We are not supposed to visit it," he said; "but the great ones cannot hear and if we keep well out of sight they need never know that we have been there.  For my part I hate them and always have, but the other chieftains of the island think it best that we continue to maintain the amicable relations which exist between the two races; otherwise I should like nothing better than to lead my warriors amongst the hideous creatures and exterminate them--Pellucidar would be a better place to live were there none of them."  I wholly concurred in Ja's belief, but it seemed that it might be a difficult matter to exterminate the dominant race of Pellucidar. Thus conversing we followed the intricate trail toward the temple, which we came upon in a small clearing surrounded by enormous trees similar to those which must have flourished upon the outer crust during the carboniferous age.  Here was a mighty temple of hewn rock built in the shape of a rough oval with rounded roof in which were several large openings.  No doors or windows were visible in the sides of the structure, nor was there need of any, except one entrance for the slaves, since, as Ja explained, the Mahars flew to and from their place of ceremonial, entering and leaving the building by means of the apertures in the roof.  "But," added Ja, "there is an entrance near the base of which even the Mahars know nothing.  Come," and he led me across the clearing and about the end to a pile of loose rock which lay against the foot of the wall.  Here he removed a couple of large bowlders, revealing a small opening which led straight within the building, or so it seemed, though as I entered after Ja I discovered myself in a narrow place of extreme darkness.  "We are within the outer wall," said Ja.  "It is hollow.  Follow me closely."  The red man groped ahead a few paces and then began to ascend a primitive ladder similar to that which leads from the ground to the upper stories of his house.  We ascended for some forty feet when the interior of the space between the walls commenced to grow lighter and presently we came opposite an opening in the inner wall which gave us an unobstructed view of the entire interior of the temple.  The lower floor was an enormous tank of clear water in which numerous hideous Mahars swam lazily up and down.  Artificial islands of granite rock dotted this artificial sea, and upon several of them I saw men and women like myself.  "What are the human beings doing here?" I asked.  "Wait and you shall see," replied Ja.  "They are to take a leading part in the ceremonies which will follow the advent of the queen. You may be thankful that you are not upon the same side of the wall as they."  Scarcely had he spoken than we heard a great fluttering of wings above and a moment later a long procession of the frightful reptiles of Pellucidar winged slowly and majestically through the large central opening in the roof and circled in stately manner about the temple.  There were several Mahars first, and then at least twenty awe-inspiring pterodactyls--thipdars, they are called within Pellucidar.  Behind these came the queen, flanked by other thipdars as she had been when she entered the amphitheater at Phutra.  Three times they wheeled about the interior of the oval chamber, to settle finally upon the damp, cold bowlders that fringe the outer edge of the pool.  In the center of one side the largest rock was reserved for the queen, and here she took her place surrounded by her terrible guard.  All lay quiet for several minutes after settling to their places. One might have imagined them in silent prayer.  The poor slaves upon the diminutive islands watched the horrid creatures with wide eyes.  The men, for the most part, stood erect and stately with folded arms, awaiting their doom; but the women and children clung to one another, hiding behind the males.  They are a noble-looking race, these cave men of Pellucidar, and if our progenitors were as they, the human race of the outer crust has deteriorated rather than improved with the march of the ages.  All they lack is opportunity. We have opportunity, and little else.  Now the queen moved.  She raised her ugly head, looking about; then very slowly she crawled to the edge of her throne and slid noiselessly into the water.  Up and down the long tank she swam, turning at the ends as you have seen captive seals turn in their tiny tanks, turning upon their backs and diving below the surface.  Nearer and nearer to the island she came until at last she remained at rest before the largest, which was directly opposite her throne. Raising her hideous head from the water she fixed her great, round eyes upon the slaves.  They were fat and sleek, for they had been brought from a distant Mahar city where human beings are kept in droves, and bred and fattened, as we breed and fatten beef cattle.  The queen fixed her gaze upon a plump young maiden.  Her victim tried to turn away, hiding her face in her hands and kneeling behind a woman; but the reptile, with unblinking eyes, stared on with such fixity that I could have sworn her vision penetrated the woman, and the girl's arms to reach at last the very center of her brain.  Slowly the reptile's head commenced to move to and fro, but the eyes never ceased to bore toward the frightened girl, and then the victim responded.  She turned wide, fear-haunted eyes toward the Mahar queen, slowly she rose to her feet, and then as though dragged by some unseen power she moved as one in a trance straight toward the reptile, her glassy eyes fixed upon those of her captor.  To the water's edge she came, nor did she even pause, but stepped into the shallows beside the little island.  On she moved toward the Mahar, who now slowly retreated as though leading her victim on.  The water rose to the girl's knees, and still she advanced, chained by that clammy eye.  Now the water was at her waist; now her armpits.  Her fellows upon the island looked on in horror, helpless to avert her doom in which they saw a forecast of their own.  The Mahar sank now till only the long upper bill and eyes were exposed above the surface of the water, and the girl had advanced until the end of that repulsive beak was but an inch or two from her face, her horror-filled eyes riveted upon those of the reptile.  Now the water passed above the girl's mouth and nose--her eyes and forehead all that showed--yet still she walked on after the retreating Mahar.  The queen's head slowly disappeared beneath the surface and after it went the eyes of her victim--only a slow ripple widened toward the shores to mark where the two vanished.  For a time all was silence within the temple.  The slaves were motionless in terror.  The Mahars watched the surface of the water for the reappearance of their queen, and presently at one end of the tank her head rose slowly into view.  She was backing toward the surface, her eyes fixed before her as they had been when she dragged the helpless girl to her doom.  And then to my utter amazement I saw the forehead and eyes of the maiden come slowly out of the depths, following the gaze of the reptile just as when she had disappeared beneath the surface.  On and on came the girl until she stood in water that reached barely to her knees, and though she had been beneath the surface sufficient time to have drowned her thrice over there was no indication, other than her dripping hair and glistening body, that she had been submerged at all.  Again and again the queen led the girl into the depths and out again, until the uncanny weirdness of the thing got on my nerves so that I could have leaped into the tank to the child's rescue had I not taken a firm hold of myself.  Once they were below much longer than usual, and when they came to the surface I was horrified to see that one of the girl's arms was gone--gnawed completely off at the shoulder--but the poor thing gave no indication of realizing pain, only the horror in her set eyes seemed intensified.  The next time they appeared the other arm was gone, and then the breasts, and then a part of the face--it was awful.  The poor creatures on the islands awaiting their fate tried to cover their eyes with their hands to hide the fearful sight, but now I saw that they too were under the hypnotic spell of the reptiles, so that they could only crouch in terror with their eyes fixed upon the terrible thing that was transpiring before them.  Finally the queen was under much longer than ever before, and when she rose she came alone and swam sleepily toward her bowlder.  The moment she mounted it seemed to be the signal for the other Mahars to enter the tank, and then commenced, upon a larger scale, a repetition of the uncanny performance through which the queen had led her victim.  Only the women and children fell prey to the Mahars--they being the weakest and most tender--and when they had satisfied their appetite for human flesh, some of them devouring two and three of the slaves, there were only a score of full-grown men left, and I thought that for some reason these were to be spared, but such was far from the case, for as the last Mahar crawled to her rock the queen's thipdars darted into the air, circled the temple once and then, hissing like steam engines, swooped down upon the remaining slaves.  There was no hypnotism here--just the plain, brutal ferocity of the beast of prey, tearing, rending, and gulping its meat, but at that it was less horrible than the uncanny method of the Mahars. By the time the thipdars had disposed of the last of the slaves the Mahars were all asleep upon their rocks, and a moment later the great pterodactyls swung back to their posts beside the queen, and themselves dropped into slumber.  "I thought the Mahars seldom, if ever, slept," I said to Ja.  "They do many things in this temple which they do not do elsewhere," he replied.  "The Mahars of Phutra are not supposed to eat human flesh, yet slaves are brought here by thousands and almost always you will find Mahars on hand to consume them.  I imagine that they do not bring their Sagoths here, because they are ashamed of the practice, which is supposed to obtain only among the least advanced of their race; but I would wager my canoe against a broken paddle that there is no Mahar but eats human flesh whenever she can get it."  "Why should they object to eating human flesh," I asked, "if it is true that they look upon us as lower animals?"  "It is not because they consider us their equals that they are supposed to look with abhorrence upon those who eat our flesh," replied Ja; "it is merely that we are warm-blooded animals.  They would not think of eating the meat of a thag, which we consider such a delicacy, any more than I would think of eating a snake.  As a matter of fact it is difficult to explain just why this sentiment should exist among them."  "I wonder if they left a single victim," I remarked, leaning far out of the opening in the rocky wall to inspect the temple better. Directly below me the water lapped the very side of the wall, there being a break in the bowlders at this point as there was at several other places about the side of the temple.  My hands were resting upon a small piece of granite which formed a part of the wall, and all my weight upon it proved too much for it.  It slipped and I lunged forward.  There was nothing to save myself and I plunged headforemost into the water below.  Fortunately the tank was deep at this point, and I suffered no injury from the fall, but as I was rising to the surface my mind filled with the horrors of my position as I thought of the terrible doom which awaited me the moment the eyes of the reptiles fell upon the creature that had disturbed their slumber.  As long as I could I remained beneath the surface, swimming rapidly in the direction of the islands that I might prolong my life to the utmost.  At last I was forced to rise for air, and as I cast a terrified glance in the direction of the Mahars and the thipdars I was almost stunned to see that not a single one remained upon the rocks where I had last seen them, nor as I searched the temple with my eyes could I discern any within it.  For a moment I was puzzled to account for the thing, until I realized that the reptiles, being deaf, could not have been disturbed by the noise my body made when it hit the water, and that as there is no such thing as time within Pellucidar there was no telling how long I had been beneath the surface.  It was a difficult thing to attempt to figure out by earthly standards--this matter of elapsed time--but when I set myself to it I began to realize that I might have been submerged a second or a month or not at all.  You have no conception of the strange contradictions and impossibilities which arise when all methods of measuring time, as we know them upon earth, are non-existent.  I was about to congratulate myself upon the miracle which had saved me for the moment, when the memory of the hypnotic powers of the Mahars filled me with apprehension lest they be practicing their uncanny art upon me to the end that I merely imagined that I was alone in the temple.  At the thought cold sweat broke out upon me from every pore, and as I crawled from the water onto one of the tiny islands I was trembling like a leaf--you cannot imagine the awful horror which even the simple thought of the repulsive Mahars of Pellucidar induces in the human mind, and to feel that you are in their power--that they are crawling, slimy, and abhorrent, to drag you down beneath the waters and devour you!  It is frightful.  But they did not come, and at last I came to the conclusion that I was indeed alone within the temple.  How long I should be alone was the next question to assail me as I swam frantically about once more in search of a means to escape.  Several times I called to Ja, but he must have left after I tumbled into the tank, for I received no response to my cries.  Doubtless he had felt as certain of my doom when he saw me topple from our hiding place as I had, and lest he too should be discovered, had hastened from the temple and back to his village.  I knew that there must be some entrance to the building beside the doorways in the roof, for it did not seem reasonable to believe that the thousands of slaves which were brought here to feed the Mahars the human flesh they craved would all be carried through the air, and so I continued my search until at last it was rewarded by the discovery of several loose granite blocks in the masonry at one end of the temple.  A little effort proved sufficient to dislodge enough of these stones to permit me to crawl through into the clearing, and a moment later I had scurried across the intervening space to the dense jungle beyond.  Here I sank panting and trembling upon the matted grasses beneath the giant trees, for I felt that I had escaped from the grinning fangs of death out of the depths of my own grave.  Whatever dangers lay hidden in this island jungle, there could be none so fearsome as those which I had just escaped.  I knew that I could meet death bravely enough if it but came in the form of some familiar beast or man--anything other than the hideous and uncanny Mahars.    IX  THE FACE OF DEATH   I MUST HAVE FALLEN ASLEEP FROM EXHAUSTION.  When I awoke I was very hungry, and after busying myself searching for fruit for a while, I set off through the jungle to find the beach.  I knew that the island was not so large but that I could easily find the sea if I did but move in a straight line, but there came the difficulty as there was no way in which I could direct my course and hold it, the sun, of course, being always directly above my head, and the trees so thickly set that I could see no distant object which might serve to guide me in a straight line.  As it was I must have walked for a great distance since I ate four times and slept twice before I reached the sea, but at last I did so, and my pleasure at the sight of it was greatly enhanced by the chance discovery of a hidden canoe among the bushes through which I had stumbled just prior to coming upon the beach.  I can tell you that it did not take me long to pull that awkward craft down to the water and shove it far out from shore.  My experience with Ja had taught me that if I were to steal another canoe I must be quick about it and get far beyond the owner's reach as soon as possible.  I must have come out upon the opposite side of the island from that at which Ja and I had entered it, for the mainland was nowhere in sight.  For a long time I paddled around the shore, though well out, before I saw the mainland in the distance.  At the sight of it I lost no time in directing my course toward it, for I had long since made up my mind to return to Phutra and give myself up that I might be once more with Perry and Ghak the Hairy One.  I felt that I was a fool ever to have attempted to escape alone, especially in view of the fact that our plans were already well formulated to make a break for freedom together.  Of course I realized that the chances of the success of our proposed venture were slim indeed, but I knew that I never could enjoy freedom without Perry so long as the old man lived, and I had learned that the probability that I might find him was less than slight.  Had Perry been dead, I should gladly have pitted my strength and wit against the savage and primordial world in which I found myself. I could have lived in seclusion within some rocky cave until I had found the means to outfit myself with the crude weapons of the Stone Age, and then set out in search of her whose image had now become the constant companion of my waking hours, and the central and beloved figure of my dreams.  But, to the best of my knowledge, Perry still lived and it was my duty and wish to be again with him, that we might share the dangers and vicissitudes of the strange world we had discovered.  And Ghak, too; the great, shaggy man had found a place in the hearts of us both, for he was indeed every inch a man and king.  Uncouth, perhaps, and brutal, too, if judged too harshly by the standards of effete twentieth-century civilization, but withal noble, dignified, chivalrous, and loveable.  Chance carried me to the very beach upon which I had discovered Ja's canoe, and a short time later I was scrambling up the steep bank to retrace my steps from the plain of Phutra.  But my troubles came when I entered the canyon beyond the summit, for here I found that several of them centered at the point where I crossed the divide, and which one I had traversed to reach the pass I could not for the life of me remember.  It was all a matter of chance and so I set off down that which seemed the easiest going, and in this I made the same mistake that many of us do in selecting the path along which we shall follow out the course of our lives, and again learned that it is not always best to follow the line of least resistance.  By the time I had eaten eight meals and slept twice I was convinced that I was upon the wrong trail, for between Phutra and the inland sea I had not slept at all, and had eaten but once.  To retrace my steps to the summit of the divide and explore another canyon seemed the only solution of my problem, but a sudden widening and levelness of the canyon just before me seemed to suggest that it was about to open into a level country, and with the lure of discovery strong upon me I decided to proceed but a short distance farther before I turned back.  The next turn of the canyon brought me to its mouth, and before me I saw a narrow plain leading down to an ocean.  At my right the side of the canyon continued to the water's edge, the valley lying to my left, and the foot of it running gradually into the sea, where it formed a broad level beach.  Clumps of strange trees dotted the landscape here and there almost to the water, and rank grass and ferns grew between.  From the nature of the vegetation I was convinced that the land between the ocean and the foothills was swampy, though directly before me it seemed dry enough all the way to the sandy strip along which the restless waters advanced and retreated.  Curiosity prompted me to walk down to the beach, for the scene was very beautiful.  As I passed along beside the deep and tangled vegetation of the swamp I thought that I saw a movement of the ferns at my left, but though I stopped a moment to look it was not repeated, and if anything lay hid there my eyes could not penetrate the dense foliage to discern it.  Presently I stood upon the beach looking out over the wide and lonely sea across whose forbidding bosom no human being had yet ventured, to discover what strange and mysterious lands lay beyond, or what its invisible islands held of riches, wonders, or adventure. What savage faces, what fierce and formidable beasts were this very instant watching the lapping of the waves upon its farther shore! How far did it extend?  Perry had told me that the seas of Pellucidar were small in comparison with those of the outer crust, but even so this great ocean might stretch its broad expanse for thousands of miles.  For countless ages it had rolled up and down its countless miles of shore, and yet today it remained all unknown beyond the tiny strip that was visible from its beaches.  The fascination of speculation was strong upon me.  It was as though I had been carried back to the birth time of our own outer world to look upon its lands and seas ages before man had traversed either.  Here was a new world, all untouched.  It called to me to explore it.  I was dreaming of the excitement and adventure which lay before us could Perry and I but escape the Mahars, when something, a slight noise I imagine, drew my attention behind me.  As I turned, romance, adventure, and discovery in the abstract took wing before the terrible embodiment of all three in concrete form that I beheld advancing upon me.  A huge, slimy amphibian it was, with toad-like body and the mighty jaws of an alligator.  Its immense carcass must have weighed tons, and yet it moved swiftly and silently toward me.  Upon one hand was the bluff that ran from the canyon to the sea, on the other the fearsome swamp from which the creature had sneaked upon me, behind lay the mighty untracked sea, and before me in the center of the narrow way that led to safety stood this huge mountain of terrible and menacing flesh.  A single glance at the thing was sufficient to assure me that I was facing one of those long-extinct, prehistoric creatures whose fossilized remains are found within the outer crust as far back as the Triassic formation, a gigantic labyrinthodon.  And there I was, unarmed, and, with the exception of a loin cloth, as naked as I had come into the world.  I could imagine how my first ancestor felt that distant, prehistoric morn that he encountered for the first time the terrifying progenitor of the thing that had me cornered now beside the restless, mysterious sea.  Unquestionably he had escaped, or I should not have been within Pellucidar or elsewhere, and I wished at that moment that he had handed down to me with the various attributes that I presumed I have inherited from him, the specific application of the instinct of self-preservation which saved him from the fate which loomed so close before me today.  To seek escape in the swamp or in the ocean would have been similar to jumping into a den of lions to escape one upon the outside. The sea and swamp both were doubtless alive with these mighty, carnivorous amphibians, and if not, the individual that menaced me would pursue me into either the sea or the swamp with equal facility.  There seemed nothing to do but stand supinely and await my end. I thought of Perry--how he would wonder what had become of me.  I thought of my friends of the outer world, and of how they all would go on living their lives in total ignorance of the strange and terrible fate that had overtaken me, or unguessing the weird surroundings which had witnessed the last frightful agony of my extinction.  And with these thoughts came a realization of how unimportant to the life and happiness of the world is the existence of any one of us.  We may be snuffed out without an instant's warning, and for a brief day our friends speak of us with subdued voices.  The following morning, while the first worm is busily engaged in testing the construction of our coffin, they are teeing up for the first hole to suffer more acute sorrow over a sliced ball than they did over our, to us, untimely demise.  The labyrinthodon was coming more slowly now.  He seemed to realize that escape for me was impossible, and I could have sworn that his huge, fanged jaws grinned in pleasurable appreciation of my predicament, or was it in anticipation of the juicy morsel which would so soon be pulp between those formidable teeth?  He was about fifty feet from me when I heard a voice calling to me from the direction of the bluff at my left.  I looked and could have shouted in delight at the sight that met my eyes, for there stood Ja, waving frantically to me, and urging me to run for it to the cliff's base.  I had no idea that I should escape the monster that had marked me for his breakfast, but at least I should not die alone.  Human eyes would watch me end.  It was cold comfort I presume, but yet I derived some slight peace of mind from the contemplation of it.  To run seemed ridiculous, especially toward that steep and unscalable cliff, and yet I did so, and as I ran I saw Ja, agile as a monkey, crawl down the precipitous face of the rocks, clinging to small projections, and the tough creepers that had found root-hold here and there.  The labyrinthodon evidently thought that Ja was coming to double his portion of human flesh, so he was in no haste to pursue me to the cliff and frighten away this other tidbit.  Instead he merely trotted along behind me.  As I approached the foot of the cliff I saw what Ja intended doing, but I doubted if the thing would prove successful.  He had come down to within twenty feet of the bottom, and there, clinging with one hand to a small ledge, and with his feet resting, precariously upon tiny bushes that grew from the solid face of the rock, he lowered the point of his long spear until it hung some six feet above the ground.  To clamber up that slim shaft without dragging Ja down and precipitating both to the same doom from which the copper-colored one was attempting to save me seemed utterly impossible, and as I came near the spear I told Ja so, and that I could not risk him to try to save myself.  But he insisted that he knew what he was doing and was in no danger himself.  "The danger is still yours," he called, "for unless you move much more rapidly than you are now, the sithic will be upon you and drag you back before ever you are halfway up the spear--he can rear up and reach you with ease anywhere below where I stand."  Well, Ja should know his own business, I thought, and so I grasped the spear and clambered up toward the red man as rapidly as I could--being so far removed from my simian ancestors as I am.  I imagine the slow-witted sithic, as Ja called him, suddenly realized our intentions and that he was quite likely to lose all his meal instead of having it doubled as he had hoped.  When he saw me clambering up that spear he let out a hiss that fairly shook the ground, and came charging after me at a terrific rate.  I had reached the top of the spear by this time, or almost; another six inches would give me a hold on Ja's hand, when I felt a sudden wrench from below and glancing fearfully downward saw the mighty jaws of the monster close on the sharp point of the weapon.  I made a frantic effort to reach Ja's hand, the sithic gave a tremendous tug that came near to jerking Ja from his frail hold on the surface of the rock, the spear slipped from his fingers, and still clinging to it I plunged feet foremost toward my executioner.  At the instant that he felt the spear come away from Ja's hand the creature must have opened his huge jaws to catch me, for when I came down, still clinging to the butt end of the weapon, the point yet rested in his mouth and the result was that the sharpened end transfixed his lower jaw.  With the pain he snapped his mouth closed.  I fell upon his snout, lost my hold upon the spear, rolled the length of his face and head, across his short neck onto his broad back and from there to the ground.  Scarce had I touched the earth than I was upon my feet, dashing madly for the path by which I had entered this horrible valley.  A glance over my shoulder showed me the sithic engaged in pawing at the spear stuck through his lower jaw, and so busily engaged did he remain in this occupation that I had gained the safety of the cliff top before he was ready to take up the pursuit.  When he did not discover me in sight within the valley he dashed, hissing into the rank vegetation of the swamp and that was the last I saw of him.    X  PHUTRA AGAIN   I HASTENED TO THE CLIFF EDGE ABOVE JA AND helped him to a secure footing.  He would not listen to any thanks for his attempt to save me, which had come so near miscarrying.  "I had given you up for lost when you tumbled into the Mahar temple," he said, "for not even I could save you from their clutches, and you may imagine my surprise when on seeing a canoe dragged up upon the beach of the mainland I discovered your own footprints in the sand beside it.  "I immediately set out in search of you, knowing as I did that you must be entirely unarmed and defenseless against the many dangers which lurk upon the mainland both in the form of savage beasts and reptiles, and men as well.  I had no difficulty in tracking you to this point.  It is well that I arrived when I did."  "But why did you do it?" I asked, puzzled at this show of friendship on the part of a man of another world and a different race and color.  "You saved my life," he replied; "from that moment it became my duty to protect and befriend you.  I would have been no true Mezop had I evaded my plain duty; but it was a pleasure in this instance for I like you.  I wish that you would come and live with me.  You shall become a member of my tribe.  Among us there is the best of hunting and fishing, and you shall have, to choose a mate from, the most beautiful girls of Pellucidar.  Will you come?"  I told him about Perry then, and Dian the Beautiful, and how my duty was to them first.  Afterward I should return and visit him--if I could ever find his island.  "Oh, that is easy, my friend," he said.  "You need merely to come to the foot of the highest peak of the Mountains of the Clouds. There you will find a river which flows into the Lural Az.  Directly opposite the mouth of the river you will see three large islands far out, so far that they are barely discernible, the one to the extreme left as you face them from the mouth of the river is Anoroc, where I rule the tribe of Anoroc."  "But how am I to find the Mountains of the Clouds?" I asked.  "Men say that they are visible from half Pellucidar," he replied.  "How large is Pellucidar?" I asked, wondering what sort of theory these primitive men had concerning the form and substance of their world.  "The Mahars say it is round, like the inside of a tola shell," he answered, "but that is ridiculous, since, were it true, we should fall back were we to travel far in any direction, and all the waters of Pellucidar would run to one spot and drown us.  No, Pellucidar is quite flat and extends no man knows how far in all directions. At the edges, so my ancestors have reported and handed down to me, is a great wall that prevents the earth and waters from escaping over into the burning sea whereon Pellucidar floats; but I never have been so far from Anoroc as to have seen this wall with my own eyes.  However, it is quite reasonable to believe that this is true, whereas there is no reason at all in the foolish belief of the Mahars.  According to them Pellucidarians who live upon the opposite side walk always with their heads pointed downward!" and Ja laughed uproariously at the very thought.  It was plain to see that the human folk of this inner world had not advanced far in learning, and the thought that the ugly Mahars had so outstripped them was a very pathetic one indeed.  I wondered how many ages it would take to lift these people out of their ignorance even were it given to Perry and me to attempt it.  Possibly we would be killed for our pains as were those men of the outer world who dared challenge the dense ignorance and superstitions of the earth's younger days.  But it was worth the effort if the opportunity ever presented itself.  And then it occurred to me that here was an opportunity--that I might make a small beginning upon Ja, who was my friend, and thus note the effect of my teaching upon a Pellucidarian.  "Ja," I said, "what would you say were I to tell you that in so far as the Mahars' theory of the shape of Pellucidar is concerned it is correct?"  "I would say," he replied, "that either you are a fool, or took me for one."  "But, Ja," I insisted, "if their theory is incorrect how do you account for the fact that I was able to pass through the earth from the outer crust to Pellucidar.  If your theory is correct all is a sea of flame beneath us, where in no peoples could exist, and yet I come from a great world that is covered with human beings, and beasts, and birds, and fishes in mighty oceans."  "You live upon the under side of Pellucidar, and walk always with your head pointed downward?" he scoffed.  "And were I to believe that, my friend, I should indeed be mad."  I attempted to explain the force of gravity to him, and by the means of the dropped fruit to illustrate how impossible it would be for a body to fall off the earth under any circumstances.  He listened so intently that I thought I had made an impression, and started the train of thought that would lead him to a partial understanding of the truth.  But I was mistaken.  "Your own illustration," he said finally, "proves the falsity of your theory."  He dropped a fruit from his hand to the ground. "See," he said, "without support even this tiny fruit falls until it strikes something that stops it.  If Pellucidar were not supported upon the flaming sea it too would fall as the fruit falls--you have proven it yourself!" He had me, that time--you could see it in his eye.  It seemed a hopeless job and I gave it up, temporarily at least, for when I contemplated the necessity explanation of our solar system and the universe I realized how futile it would be to attempt to picture to Ja or any other Pellucidarian the sun, the moon, the planets, and the countless stars.  Those born within the inner world could no more conceive of such things than can we of the outer crust reduce to factors appreciable to our finite minds such terms as space and eternity.  "Well, Ja," I laughed, "whether we be walking with our feet up or down, here we are, and the question of greatest importance is not so much where we came from as where we are going now.  For my part I wish that you could guide me to Phutra where I may give myself up to the Mahars once more that my friends and I may work out the plan of escape which the Sagoths interrupted when they gathered us together and drove us to the arena to witness the punishment of the slaves who killed the guardsman.  I wish now that I had not left the arena for by this time my friends and I might have made good our escape, whereas this delay may mean the wrecking of all our plans, which depended for their consummation upon the continued sleep of the three Mahars who lay in the pit beneath the building in which we were confined."  "You would return to captivity?" cried Ja.  "My friends are there," I replied, "the only friends I have in Pellucidar, except yourself.  What else may I do under the circumstances?"  He thought for a moment in silence.  Then he shook his head sorrowfully.  "It is what a brave man and a good friend should do," he said; "yet it seems most foolish, for the Mahars will most certainly condemn you to death for running away, and so you will be accomplishing nothing for your friends by returning.  Never in all my life have I heard of a prisoner returning to the Mahars of his own free will. There are but few who escape them, though some do, and these would rather die than be recaptured."  "I see no other way, Ja," I said, "though I can assure you that I would rather go to Sheol after Perry than to Phutra.  However, Perry is much too pious to make the probability at all great that I should ever be called upon to rescue him from the former locality."  Ja asked me what Sheol was, and when I explained, as best I could, he said, "You are speaking of Molop Az, the flaming sea upon which Pellucidar floats.  All the dead who are buried in the ground go there.  Piece by piece they are carried down to Molop Az by the little demons who dwell there.  We know this because when graves are opened we find that the bodies have been partially or entirely borne off.  That is why we of Anoroc place our dead in high trees where the birds may find them and bear them bit by bit to the Dead World above the Land of Awful Shadow.  If we kill an enemy we place his body in the ground that it may go to Molop Az."  As we talked we had been walking up the canyon down which I had come to the great ocean and the sithic.  Ja did his best to dissuade me from returning to Phutra, but when he saw that I was determined to do so, he consented to guide me to a point from which I could see the plain where lay the city.  To my surprise the distance was but short from the beach where I had again met Ja.  It was evident that I had spent much time following the windings of a tortuous canon, while just beyond the ridge lay the city of Phutra near to which I must have come several times.  As we topped the ridge and saw the granite gate towers dotting the flowered plain at our feet Ja made a final effort to persuade me to abandon my mad purpose and return with him to Anoroc, but I was firm in my resolve, and at last he bid me good-bye, assured in his own mind that he was looking upon me for the last time.  I was sorry to part with Ja, for I had come to like him very much indeed.  With his hidden city upon the island of Anoroc as a base, and his savage warriors as escort Perry and I could have accomplished much in the line of exploration, and I hoped that were we successful in our effort to escape we might return to Anoroc later.  There was, however, one great thing to be accomplished first--at least it was the great thing to me--the finding of Dian the Beautiful. I wanted to make amends for the affront I had put upon her in my ignorance, and I wanted to--well, I wanted to see her again, and to be with her.  Down the hillside I made my way into the gorgeous field of flowers, and then across the rolling land toward the shadowless columns that guard the ways to buried Phutra.  At a quarter-mile from the nearest entrance I was discovered by the Sagoth guard, and in an instant four of the gorilla-men were dashing toward me.  Though they brandished their long spears and yelled like wild Comanches I paid not the slightest attention to them, walking quietly toward them as though unaware of their existence.  My manner had the effect upon them that I had hoped, and as we came quite near together they ceased their savage shouting.  It was evident that they had expected me to turn and flee at sight of them, thus presenting that which they most enjoyed, a moving human target at which to cast their spears.  "What do you here?" shouted one, and then as he recognized me, "Ho!  It is the slave who claims to be from another world--he who escaped when the thag ran amuck within the amphitheater.  But why do you return, having once made good your escape?"  "I did not 'escape'," I replied.  "I but ran away to avoid the thag, as did others, and coming into a long passage I became confused and lost my way in the foothills beyond Phutra.  Only now have I found my way back."  "And you come of your free will back to Phutra!" exclaimed one of the guardsmen.  "Where else might I go?" I asked.  "I am a stranger within Pellucidar and know no other where than Phutra.  Why should I not desire to be in Phutra?  Am I not well fed and well treated?  Am I not happy? What better lot could man desire?"  The Sagoths scratched their heads.  This was a new one on them, and so being stupid brutes they took me to their masters whom they felt would be better fitted to solve the riddle of my return, for riddle they still considered it.  I had spoken to the Sagoths as I had for the purpose of throwing them off the scent of my purposed attempt at escape.  If they thought that I was so satisfied with my lot within Phutra that I would voluntarily return when I had once had so excellent an opportunity to escape, they would never for an instant imagine that I could be occupied in arranging another escape immediately upon my return to the city.  So they led me before a slimy Mahar who clung to a slimy rock within the large room that was the thing's office.  With cold, reptilian eyes the creature seemed to bore through the thin veneer of my deceit and read my inmost thoughts.  It heeded the story which the Sagoths told of my return to Phutra, watching the gorilla-men's lips and fingers during the recital.  Then it questioned me through one of the Sagoths.  "You say that you returned to Phutra of your own free will, because you think yourself better off here than elsewhere--do you not know that you may be the next chosen to give up your life in the interests of the wonderful scientific investigations that our learned ones are continually occupied with?"  I hadn't heard of anything of that nature, but I thought best not to admit it.  "I could be in no more danger here," I said, "than naked and unarmed in the savage jungles or upon the lonely plains of Pellucidar.  I was fortunate, I think, to return to Phutra at all.  As it was I barely escaped death within the jaws of a huge sithic.  No, I am sure that I am safer in the hands of intelligent creatures such as rule Phutra.  At least such would be the case in my own world, where human beings like myself rule supreme.  There the higher races of man extend protection and hospitality to the stranger within their gates, and being a stranger here I naturally assumed that a like courtesy would be accorded me."  The Mahar looked at me in silence for some time after I ceased speaking and the Sagoth had translated my words to his master.  The creature seemed deep in thought.  Presently he communicated some message to the Sagoth.  The latter turned, and motioning me to follow him, left the presence of the reptile.  Behind and on either side of me marched the balance of the guard.  "What are they going to do with me?" I asked the fellow at my right.  "You are to appear before the learned ones who will question you regarding this strange world from which you say you come."  After a moment's silence he turned to me again.  "Do you happen to know," he asked, "what the Mahars do to slaves who lie to them?"  "No," I replied, "nor does it interest me, as I have no intention of lying to the Mahars."  "Then be careful that you don't repeat the impossible tale you told Sol-to-to just now--another world, indeed, where human beings rule!" he concluded in fine scorn.  "But it is the truth," I insisted.  "From where else then did I come?  I am not of Pellucidar.  Anyone with half an eye could see that."  "It is your misfortune then," he remarked dryly, "that you may not be judged by one with but half an eye."  "What will they do with me," I asked, "if they do not have a mind to believe me?"  "You may be sentenced to the arena, or go to the pits to be used in research work by the learned ones," he replied.  "And what will they do with me there?" I persisted.  "No one knows except the Mahars and those who go to the pits with them, but as the latter never return, their knowledge does them but little good.  It is said that the learned ones cut up their subjects while they are yet alive, thus learning many useful things. However I should not imagine that it would prove very useful to him who was being cut up; but of course this is all but conjecture. The chances are that ere long you will know much more about it than I," and he grinned as he spoke.  The Sagoths have a well-developed sense of humor.  "And suppose it is the arena," I continued; "what then?"  "You saw the two who met the tarag and the thag the time that you escaped?" he said.  "Yes."  "Your end in the arena would be similar to what was intended for them," he explained, "though of course the same kinds of animals might not be employed."  "It is sure death in either event?" I asked.  "What becomes of those who go below with the learned ones I do not know, nor does any other," he replied; "but those who go to the arena may come out alive and thus regain their liberty, as did the two whom you saw."  "They gained their liberty?  And how?"  "It is the custom of the Mahars to liberate those who remain alive within the arena after the beasts depart or are killed.  Thus it has happened that several mighty warriors from far distant lands, whom we have captured on our slave raids, have battled the brutes turned in upon them and slain them, thereby winning their freedom. In the instance which you witnessed the beasts killed each other, but the result was the same--the man and woman were liberated, furnished with weapons, and started on their homeward journey. Upon the left shoulder of each a mark was burned--the mark of the Mahars--which will forever protect these two from slaving parties."  "There is a slender chance for me then if I be sent to the arena, and none at all if the learned ones drag me to the pits?"  "You are quite right," he replied; "but do not felicitate yourself too quickly should you be sent to the arena, for there is scarce one in a thousand who comes out alive."  To my surprise they returned me to the same building in which I had been confined with Perry and Ghak before my escape.  At the doorway I was turned over to the guards there.  "He will doubtless be called before the investigators shortly," said he who had brought me back, "so have him in readiness."  The guards in whose hands I now found myself, upon hearing that I had returned of my own volition to Phutra evidently felt that it would be safe to give me liberty within the building as had been the custom before I had escaped, and so I was told to return to whatever duty had been mine formerly.  My first act was to hunt up Perry; whom I found poring as usual over the great tomes that he was supposed to be merely dusting and rearranging upon new shelves.  As I entered the room he glanced up and nodded pleasantly to me, only to resume his work as though I had never been away at all. I was both astonished and hurt at his indifference.  And to think that I was risking death to return to him purely from a sense of duty and affection!  "Why, Perry!" I exclaimed, "haven't you a word for me after my long absence?"  "Long absence!" he repeated in evident astonishment.  "What do you mean?"  "Are you crazy, Perry?  Do you mean to say that you have not missed me since that time we were separated by the charging thag within the arena?"  "'That time'," he repeated.  "Why man, I have but just returned from the arena!  You reached here almost as soon as I. Had you been much later I should indeed have been worried, and as it is I had intended asking you about how you escaped the beast as soon as I had completed the translation of this most interesting passage."  "Perry, you ARE mad," I exclaimed.  "Why, the Lord only knows how long I have been away.  I have been to other lands, discovered a new race of humans within Pellucidar, seen the Mahars at their worship in their hidden temple, and barely escaped with my life from them and from a great labyrinthodon that I met afterward, following my long and tedious wanderings across an unknown world. I must have been away for months, Perry, and now you barely look up from your work when I return and insist that we have been separated but a moment.  Is that any way to treat a friend?  I'm surprised at you, Perry, and if I'd thought for a moment that you cared no more for me than this I should not have returned to chance death at the hands of the Mahars for your sake."  The old man looked at me for a long time before he spoke.  There was a puzzled expression upon his wrinkled face, and a look of hurt sorrow in his eyes.  "David, my boy," he said, "how could you for a moment doubt my love for you?  There is something strange here that I cannot understand. I know that I am not mad, and I am equally sure that you are not; but how in the world are we to account for the strange hallucinations that each of us seems to harbor relative to the passage of time since last we saw each other.  You are positive that months have gone by, while to me it seems equally certain that not more than an hour ago I sat beside you in the amphitheater.  Can it be that both of us are right and at the same time both are wrong?  First tell me what time is, and then maybe I can solve our problem.  Do you catch my meaning?"  I didn't and said so.  "Yes," continued the old man, "we are both right.  To me, bent over my book here, there has been no lapse of time.  I have done little or nothing to waste my energies and so have required neither food nor sleep, but you, on the contrary, have walked and fought and wasted strength and tissue which must needs be rebuilt by nutriment and food, and so, having eaten and slept many times since last you saw me you naturally measure the lapse of time largely by these acts. As a matter of fact, David, I am rapidly coming to the conviction that there is no such thing as time--surely there can be no time here within Pellucidar, where there are no means for measuring or recording time.  Why, the Mahars themselves take no account of such a thing as time.  I find here in all their literary works but a single tense, the present.  There seems to be neither past nor future with them.  Of course it is impossible for our outer-earthly minds to grasp such a condition, but our recent experiences seem to demonstrate its existence."  It was too big a subject for me, and I said so, but Perry seemed to enjoy nothing better than speculating upon it, and after listening with interest to my account of the adventures through which I had passed he returned once more to the subject, which he was enlarging upon with considerable fluency when he was interrupted by the entrance of a Sagoth.  "Come!" commanded the intruder, beckoning to me.  "The investigators would speak with you."  "Good-bye, Perry!" I said, clasping the old man's hand.  "There may be nothing but the present and no such thing as time, but I feel that I am about to take a trip into the hereafter from which I shall never return.  If you and Ghak should manage to escape I want you to promise me that you will find Dian the Beautiful and tell her that with my last words I asked her forgiveness for the unintentional affront I put upon her, and that my one wish was to be spared long enough to right the wrong that I had done her."  Tears came to Perry's eyes.  "I cannot believe but that you will return, David," he said.  "It would be awful to think of living out the balance of my life without you among these hateful and repulsive creatures.  If you are taken away I shall never escape, for I feel that I am as well off here as I should be anywhere within this buried world.  Good-bye, my boy, good-bye!" and then his old voice faltered and broke, and as he hid his face in his hands the Sagoth guardsman grasped me roughly by the shoulder and hustled me from the chamber.    XI  FOUR DEAD MAHARS   A MOMENT LATER I WAS STANDING BEFORE A DOZEN Mahars--the social investigators of Phutra.  They asked me many questions, through a Sagoth interpreter.  I answered them all truthfully.  They seemed particularly interested in my account of the outer earth and the strange vehicle which had brought Perry and me to Pellucidar.  I thought that I had convinced them, and after they had sat in silence for a long time following my examination, I expected to be ordered returned to my quarters.  During this apparent silence they were debating through the medium of strange, unspoken language the merits of my tale.  At last the head of the tribunal communicated the result of their conference to the officer in charge of the Sagoth guard.  "Come," he said to me, "you are sentenced to the experimental pits for having dared to insult the intelligence of the mighty ones with the ridiculous tale you have had the temerity to unfold to them."  "Do you mean that they do not believe me?" I asked, totally astonished.  "Believe you!" he laughed.  "Do you mean to say that you expected any one to believe so impossible a lie?"  It was hopeless, and so I walked in silence beside my guard down through the dark corridors and runways toward my awful doom.  At a low level we came upon a number of lighted chambers in which we saw many Mahars engaged in various occupations.  To one of these chambers my guard escorted me, and before leaving they chained me to a side wall.  There were other humans similarly chained.  Upon a long table lay a victim even as I was ushered into the room. Several Mahars stood about the poor creature holding him down so that he could not move.  Another, grasping a sharp knife with her three-toed fore foot, was laying open the victim's chest and abdomen. No anesthetic had been administered and the shrieks and groans of the tortured man were terrible to hear.  This, indeed, was vivisection with a vengeance.  Cold sweat broke out upon me as I realized that soon my turn would come.  And to think that where there was no such thing as time I might easily imagine that my suffering was enduring for months before death finally released me!  The Mahars had paid not the slightest attention to me as I had been brought into the room.  So deeply immersed were they in their work that I am sure they did not even know that the Sagoths had entered with me.  The door was close by.  Would that I could reach it!  But those heavy chains precluded any such possibility.  I looked about for some means of escape from my bonds.  Upon the floor between me and the Mahars lay a tiny surgical instrument which one of them must have dropped.  It looked not unlike a button-hook, but was much smaller, and its point was sharpened.  A hundred times in my boyhood days had I picked locks with a buttonhook.  Could I but reach that little bit of polished steel I might yet effect at least a temporary escape.  Crawling to the limit of my chain, I found that by reaching one hand as far out as I could my fingers still fell an inch short of the coveted instrument.  It was tantalizing!  Stretch every fiber of my being as I would, I could not quite make it.  At last I turned about and extended one foot toward the object. My heart came to my throat!  I could just touch the thing!  But suppose that in my effort to drag it toward me I should accidentally shove it still farther away and thus entirely out of reach!  Cold sweat broke out upon me from every pore.  Slowly and cautiously I made the effort.  My toes dropped upon the cold metal.  Gradually I worked it toward me until I felt that it was within reach of my hand and a moment later I had turned about and the precious thing was in my grasp.  Assiduously I fell to work upon the Mahar lock that held my chain. It was pitifully simple.  A child might have picked it, and a moment later I was free.  The Mahars were now evidently completing their work at the table.  One already turned away and was examining other victims, evidently with the intention of selecting the next subject.  Those at the table had their backs toward me.  But for the creature walking toward us I might have escaped that moment.  Slowly the thing approached me, when its attention was attracted by a huge slave chained a few yards to my right.  Here the reptile stopped and commenced to go over the poor devil carefully, and as it did so its back turned toward me for an instant, and in that instant I gave two mighty leaps that carried me out of the chamber into the corridor beyond, down which I raced with all the speed I could command.  Where I was, or whither I was going, I knew not.  My only thought was to place as much distance as possible between me and that frightful chamber of torture.  Presently I reduced my speed to a brisk walk, and later realizing the danger of running into some new predicament, were I not careful, I moved still more slowly and cautiously.  After a time I came to a passage that seemed in some mysterious way familiar to me, and presently, chancing to glance within a chamber which led from the corridor I saw three Mahars curled up in slumber upon a bed of skins.  I could have shouted aloud in joy and relief.  It was the same corridor and the same Mahars that I had intended to have lead so important a role in our escape from Phutra.  Providence had indeed been kind to me, for the reptiles still slept.  My one great danger now lay in returning to the upper levels in search of Perry and Ghak, but there was nothing else to be done, and so I hastened upward.  When I came to the frequented portions of the building, I found a large burden of skins in a corner and these I lifted to my head, carrying them in such a way that ends and corners fell down about my shoulders completely hiding my face. Thus disguised I found Perry and Ghak together in the chamber where we had been wont to eat and sleep.  Both were glad to see me, it was needless to say, though of course they had known nothing of the fate that had been meted out to me by my judges.  It was decided that no time should now be lost before attempting to put our plan of escape to the test, as I could not hope to remain hidden from the Sagoths long, nor could I forever carry that bale of skins about upon my head without arousing suspicion. However it seemed likely that it would carry me once more safely through the crowded passages and chambers of the upper levels, and so I set out with Perry and Ghak--the stench of the illy cured pelts fairly choking me.  Together we repaired to the first tier of corridors beneath the main floor of the buildings, and here Perry and Ghak halted to await me.  The buildings are cut out of the solid limestone formation. There is nothing at all remarkable about their architecture.  The rooms are sometimes rectangular, sometimes circular, and again oval in shape.  The corridors which connect them are narrow and not always straight.  The chambers are lighted by diffused sunlight reflected through tubes similar to those by which the avenues are lighted.  The lower the tiers of chambers, the darker.  Most of the corridors are entirely unlighted.  The Mahars can see quite well in semidarkness.  Down to the main floor we encountered many Mahars, Sagoths, and slaves; but no attention was paid to us as we had become a part of the domestic life of the building.  There was but a single entrance leading from the place into the avenue and this was well guarded by Sagoths--this doorway alone were we forbidden to pass.  It is true that we were not supposed to enter the deeper corridors and apartments except on special occasions when we were instructed to do so; but as we were considered a lower order without intelligence there was little reason to fear that we could accomplish any harm by so doing, and so we were not hindered as we entered the corridor which led below.  Wrapped in a skin I carried three swords, and the two bows, and the arrows which Perry and I had fashioned.  As many slaves bore skin-wrapped burdens to and fro my load attracted no comment.  Where I left Ghak and Perry there were no other creatures in sight, and so I withdrew one sword from the package, and leaving the balance of the weapons with Perry, started on alone toward the lower levels.  Having come to the apartment in which the three Mahars slept I entered silently on tiptoe, forgetting that the creatures were without the sense of hearing.  With a quick thrust through the heart I disposed of the first but my second thrust was not so fortunate, so that before I could kill the next of my victims it had hurled itself against the third, who sprang quickly up, facing me with wide-distended jaws.  But fighting is not the occupation which the race of Mahars loves, and when the thing saw that I already had dispatched two of its companions, and that my sword was red with their blood, it made a dash to escape me.  But I was too quick for it, and so, half hopping, half flying, it scurried down another corridor with me close upon its heels.  Its escape meant the utter ruin of our plan, and in all probability my instant death.  This thought lent wings to my feet; but even at my best I could do no more than hold my own with the leaping thing before me.  Of a sudden it turned into an apartment on the right of the corridor, and an instant later as I rushed in I found myself facing two of the Mahars.  The one who had been there when we entered had been occupied with a number of metal vessels, into which had been put powders and liquids as I judged from the array of flasks standing about upon the bench where it had been working.  In an instant I realized what I had stumbled upon.  It was the very room for the finding of which Perry had given me minute directions.  It was the buried chamber in which was hidden the Great Secret of the race of Mahars.  And on the bench beside the flasks lay the skin-bound book which held the only copy of the thing I was to have sought, after dispatching the three Mahars in their sleep.  There was no exit from the room other than the doorway in which I now stood facing the two frightful reptiles.  Cornered, I knew that they would fight like demons, and they were well equipped to fight if fight they must.  Together they launched themselves upon me, and though I ran one of them through the heart on the instant, the other fastened its gleaming fangs about my sword arm above the elbow, and then with her sharp talons commenced to rake me about the body, evidently intent upon disemboweling me.  I saw that it was useless to hope that I might release my arm from that powerful, viselike grip which seemed to be severing my arm from my body. The pain I suffered was intense, but it only served to spur me to greater efforts to overcome my antagonist.  Back and forth across the floor we struggled--the Mahar dealing me terrific, cutting blows with her fore feet, while I attempted to protect my body with my left hand, at the same time watching for an opportunity to transfer my blade from my now useless sword hand to its rapidly weakening mate.  At last I was successful, and with what seemed to me my last ounce of strength I ran the blade through the ugly body of my foe.  Soundless, as it had fought, it died, and though weak from pain and loss of blood, it was with an emotion of triumphant pride that I stepped across its convulsively stiffening corpse to snatch up the most potent secret of a world.  A single glance assured me it was the very thing that Perry had described to me.  And as I grasped it did I think of what it meant to the human race of Pellucidar--did there flash through my mind the thought that countless generations of my own kind yet unborn would have reason to worship me for the thing that I had accomplished for them?  I did not.  I thought of a beautiful oval face, gazing out of limpid eyes, through a waving mass of jet-black hair.  I thought of red, red lips, God-made for kissing.  And of a sudden, apropos of nothing, standing there alone in the secret chamber of the Mahars of Pellucidar, I realized that I loved Dian the Beautiful.    XII  PURSUIT   FOR AN INSTANT I STOOD THERE THINKING OF HER, and then, with a sigh, I tucked the book in the thong that supported my loin cloth, and turned to leave the apartment.  At the bottom of the corridor which leads aloft from the lower chambers I whistled in accordance with the prearranged signal which was to announce to Perry and Ghak that I had been successful.  A moment later they stood beside me, and to my surprise I saw that Hooja the Sly One accompanied them.  "He joined us," explained Perry, "and would not be denied.  The fellow is a fox.  He scents escape, and rather than be thwarted of our chance now I told him that I would bring him to you, and let you decide whether he might accompany us."  I had no love for Hooja, and no confidence in him.  I was sure that if he thought it would profit him he would betray us; but I saw no way out of it now, and the fact that I had killed four Mahars instead of only the three I had expected to, made it possible to include the fellow in our scheme of escape.  "Very well," I said, "you may come with us, Hooja; but at the first intimation of treachery I shall run my sword through you.  Do you understand?"  He said that he did.  Some time later we had removed the skins from the four Mahars, and so succeeded in crawling inside of them ourselves that there seemed an excellent chance for us to pass unnoticed from Phutra.  It was not an easy thing to fasten the hides together where we had split them along the belly to remove them from their carcasses, but by remaining out until the others had all been sewed in with my help, and then leaving an aperture in the breast of Perry's skin through which he could pass his hands to sew me up, we were enabled to accomplish our design to really much better purpose than I had hoped.  We managed to keep the heads erect by passing our swords up through the necks, and by the same means were enabled to move them about in a life-like manner.  We had our greatest difficulty with the webbed feet, but even that problem was finally solved, so that when we moved about we did so quite naturally.  Tiny holes punctured in the baggy throats into which our heads were thrust permitted us to see well enough to guide our progress.  Thus we started up toward the main floor of the building.  Ghak headed the strange procession, then came Perry, followed by Hooja, while I brought up the rear, after admonishing Hooja that I had so arranged my sword that I could thrust it through the head of my disguise into his vitals were he to show any indication of faltering.  As the noise of hurrying feet warned me that we were entering the busy corridors of the main level, my heart came up into my mouth. It is with no sense of shame that I admit that I was frightened--never before in my life, nor since, did I experience any such agony of soulsearing fear and suspense as enveloped me.  If it be possible to sweat blood, I sweat it then.  Slowly, after the manner of locomotion habitual to the Mahars, when they are not using their wings, we crept through throngs of busy slaves, Sagoths, and Mahars.  After what seemed an eternity we reached the outer door which leads into the main avenue of Phutra. Many Sagoths loitered near the opening.  They glanced at Ghak as he padded between them.  Then Perry passed, and then Hooja.  Now it was my turn, and then in a sudden fit of freezing terror I realized that the warm blood from my wounded arm was trickling down through the dead foot of the Mahar skin I wore and leaving its tell-tale mark upon the pavement, for I saw a Sagoth call a companion's attention to it.  The guard stepped before me and pointing to my bleeding foot spoke to me in the sign language which these two races employ as a means of communication.  Even had I known what he was saying I could not have replied with the dead thing that covered me.  I once had seen a great Mahar freeze a presumptuous Sagoth with a look.  It seemed my only hope, and so I tried it.  Stopping in my tracks I moved my sword so that it made the dead head appear to turn inquiring eyes upon the gorilla-man. For a long moment I stood perfectly still, eyeing the fellow with those dead eyes.  Then I lowered the head and started slowly on.  For a moment all hung in the balance, but before I touched him the guard stepped to one side, and I passed on out into the avenue.  On we went up the broad street, but now we were safe for the very numbers of our enemies that surrounded us on all sides.  Fortunately, there was a great concourse of Mahars repairing to the shallow lake which lies a mile or more from the city.  They go there to indulge their amphibian proclivities in diving for small fish, and enjoying the cool depths of the water.  It is a fresh-water lake, shallow, and free from the larger reptiles which make the use of the great seas of Pellucidar impossible for any but their own kind.  In the thick of the crowd we passed up the steps and out onto the plain.  For some distance Ghak remained with the stream that was traveling toward the lake, but finally, at the bottom of a little gully he halted, and there we remained until all had passed and we were alone.  Then, still in our disguises, we set off directly away from Phutra.  The heat of the vertical rays of the sun was fast making our horrible prisons unbearable, so that after passing a low divide, and entering a sheltering forest, we finally discarded the Mahar skins that had brought us thus far in safety.  I shall not weary you with the details of that bitter and galling flight.  How we traveled at a dogged run until we dropped in our tracks.  How we were beset by strange and terrible beasts.  How we barely escaped the cruel fangs of lions and tigers the size of which would dwarf into pitiful insignificance the greatest felines of the outer world.  On and on we raced, our one thought to put as much distance between ourselves and Phutra as possible.  Ghak was leading us to his own land--the land of Sari.  No sign of pursuit had developed, and yet we were sure that somewhere behind us relentless Sagoths were dogging our tracks.  Ghak said they never failed to hunt down their quarry until they had captured it or themselves been turned back by a superior force.  Our only hope, he said, lay in reaching his tribe which was quite strong enough in their mountain fastness to beat off any number of Sagoths.  At last, after what seemed months, and may, I now realize, have been years, we came in sight of the dun escarpment which buttressed the foothills of Sari.  At almost the same instant, Hooja, who looked ever quite as much behind as before, announced that he could see a body of men far behind us topping a low ridge in our wake. It was the long-expected pursuit.  I asked Ghak if we could make Sari in time to escape them.  "We may," he replied; "but you will find that the Sagoths can move with incredible swiftness, and as they are almost tireless they are doubtless much fresher than we.  Then--" he paused, glancing at Perry.  I knew what he meant.  The old man was exhausted.  For much of the period of our flight either Ghak or I had half supported him on the march.  With such a handicap, less fleet pursuers than the Sagoths might easily overtake us before we could scale the rugged heights which confronted us.  "You and Hooja go on ahead," I said.  "Perry and I will make it if we are able.  We cannot travel as rapidly as you two, and there is no reason why all should be lost because of that.  It can't be helped--we have simply to face it."  "I will not desert a companion," was Ghak's simple reply.  I hadn't known that this great, hairy, primeval man had any such nobility of character stowed away inside him.  I had always liked him, but now to my liking was added honor and respect.  Yes, and love.  But still I urged him to go on ahead, insisting that if he could reach his people he might be able to bring out a sufficient force to drive off the Sagoths and rescue Perry and myself.  No, he wouldn't leave us, and that was all there was to it, but he suggested that Hooja might hurry on and warn the Sarians of the king's danger.  It didn't require much urging to start Hooja--the naked idea was enough to send him leaping on ahead of us into the foothills which we now had reached.  Perry realized that he was jeopardizing Ghak's life and mine and the old fellow fairly begged us to go on without him, although I knew that he was suffering a perfect anguish of terror at the thought of falling into the hands of the Sagoths.  Ghak finally solved the problem, in part, by lifting Perry in his powerful arms and carrying him.  While the act cut down Ghak's speed he still could travel faster thus than when half supporting the stumbling old man.    XIII  THE SLY ONE   THE SAGOTHS WERE GAINING ON US RAPIDLY, FOR once they had sighted us they had greatly increased their speed.  On and on we stumbled up the narrow canyon that Ghak had chosen to approach the heights of Sari.  On either side rose precipitous cliffs of gorgeous, parti-colored rock, while beneath our feet a thick mountain grass formed a soft and noiseless carpet.  Since we had entered the canyon we had had no glimpse of our pursuers, and I was commencing to hope that they had lost our trail and that we would reach the now rapidly nearing cliffs in time to scale them before we should be overtaken.  Ahead we neither saw nor heard any sign which might betoken the success of Hooja's mission.  By now he should have reached the outposts of the Sarians, and we should at least hear the savage cries of the tribesmen as they swarmed to arms in answer to their king's appeal for succor.  In another moment the frowning cliffs ahead should be black with primeval warriors.  But nothing of the kind happened--as a matter of fact the Sly One had betrayed us. At the moment that we expected to see Sarian spearmen charging to our relief at Hooja's back, the craven traitor was sneaking around the outskirts of the nearest Sarian village, that he might come up from the other side when it was too late to save us, claiming that he had become lost among the mountains.  Hooja still harbored ill will against me because of the blow I had struck in Dian's protection, and his malevolent spirit was equal to sacrificing us all that he might be revenged upon me.  As we drew nearer the barrier cliffs and no sign of rescuing Sarians appeared Ghak became both angry and alarmed, and presently as the sound of rapidly approaching pursuit fell upon our ears, he called to me over his shoulder that we were lost.  A backward glance gave me a glimpse of the first of the Sagoths at the far end of a considerable stretch of canyon through which we had just passed, and then a sudden turning shut the ugly creature from my view; but the loud howl of triumphant rage which rose behind us was evidence that the gorilla-man had sighted us.  Again the canyon veered sharply to the left, but to the right another branch ran on at a lesser deviation from the general direction, so that appeared more like the main canyon than the lefthand branch. The Sagoths were now not over two hundred and fifty yards behind us, and I saw that it was hopeless for us to expect to escape other than by a ruse.  There was a bare chance of saving Ghak and Perry, and as I reached the branching of the canyon I took the chance.  Pausing there I waited until the foremost Sagoth hove into sight. Ghak and Perry had disappeared around a bend in the left-hand canyon, and as the Sagoth's savage yell announced that he had seen me I turned and fled up the right-hand branch.  My ruse was successful, and the entire party of man-hunters raced headlong after me up one canyon while Ghak bore Perry to safety up the other.  Running has never been my particular athletic forte, and now when my very life depended upon fleetness of foot I cannot say that I ran any better than on the occasions when my pitiful base running had called down upon my head the rooter's raucous and reproachful cries of "Ice Wagon," and "Call a cab."  The Sagoths were gaining on me rapidly.  There was one in particular, fleeter than his fellows, who was perilously close.  The canyon had become a rocky slit, rising roughly at a steep angle toward what seemed a pass between two abutting peaks.  What lay beyond I could not even guess--possibly a sheer drop of hundreds of feet into the corresponding valley upon the other side.  Could it be that I had plunged into a cul-de-sac?  Realizing that I could not hope to outdistance the Sagoths to the top of the canyon I had determined to risk all in an attempt to check them temporarily, and to this end had unslung my rudely made bow and plucked an arrow from the skin quiver which hung behind my shoulder.  As I fitted the shaft with my right hand I stopped and wheeled toward the gorilla-man.  In the world of my birth I never had drawn a shaft, but since our escape from Phutra I had kept the party supplied with small game by means of my arrows, and so, through necessity, had developed a fair degree of accuracy.  During our flight from Phutra I had restrung my bow with a piece of heavy gut taken from a huge tiger which Ghak and I had worried and finally dispatched with arrows, spear, and sword.  The hard wood of the bow was extremely tough and this, with the strength and elasticity of my new string, gave me unwonted confidence in my weapon.  Never had I greater need of steady nerves than then--never were my nerves and muscles under better control.  I sighted as carefully and deliberately as though at a straw target.  The Sagoth had never before seen a bow and arrow, but of a sudden it must have swept over his dull intellect that the thing I held toward him was some sort of engine of destruction, for he too came to a halt, simultaneously swinging his hatchet for a throw.  It is one of the many methods in which they employ this weapon, and the accuracy of aim which they achieve, even under the most unfavorable circumstances, is little short of miraculous.  My shaft was drawn back its full length--my eye had centered its sharp point upon the left breast of my adversary; and then he launched his hatchet and I released my arrow.  At the instant that our missiles flew I leaped to one side, but the Sagoth sprang forward to follow up his attack with a spear thrust.  I felt the swish of the hatchet at it grazed my head, and at the same instant my shaft pierced the Sagoth's savage heart, and with a single groan he lunged almost at my feet--stone dead.  Close behind him were two more--fifty yards perhaps--but the distance gave me time to snatch up the dead guardsman's shield, for the close call his hatchet had just given me had borne in upon me the urgent need I had for one. Those which I had purloined at Phutra we had not been able to bring along because their size precluded our concealing them within the skins of the Mahars which had brought us safely from the city.  With the shield slipped well up on my left arm I let fly with another arrow, which brought down a second Sagoth, and then as his fellow's hatchet sped toward me I caught it upon the shield, and fitted another shaft for him; but he did not wait to receive it. Instead, he turned and retreated toward the main body of gorilla-men. Evidently he had seen enough of me for the moment.  Once more I took up my flight, nor were the Sagoths apparently overanxious to press their pursuit so closely as before.  Unmolested I reached the top of the canyon where I found a sheer drop of two or three hundred feet to the bottom of a rocky chasm; but on the left a narrow ledge rounded the shoulder of the overhanging cliff. Along this I advanced, and at a sudden turning, a few yards beyond the canyon's end, the path widened, and at my left I saw the opening to a large cave.  Before, the ledge continued until it passed from sight about another projecting buttress of the mountain.  Here, I felt, I could defy an army, for but a single foeman could advance upon me at a time, nor could he know that I was awaiting him until he came full upon me around the corner of the turn.  About me lay scattered stones crumbled from the cliff above.  They were of various sizes and shapes, but enough were of handy dimensions for use as ammunition in lieu of my precious arrows.  Gathering a number of stones into a little pile beside the mouth of the cave I waited the advance of the Sagoths.  As I stood there, tense and silent, listening for the first faint sound that should announce the approach of my enemies, a slight noise from within the cave's black depths attracted my attention. It might have been produced by the moving of the great body of some huge beast rising from the rock floor of its lair.  At almost the same instant I thought that I caught the scraping of hide sandals upon the ledge beyond the turn.  For the next few seconds my attention was considerably divided.  And then from the inky blackness at my right I saw two flaming eyes glaring into mine.  They were on a level that was over two feet above my head.  It is true that the beast who owned them might be standing upon a ledge within the cave, or that it might be rearing up upon its hind legs; but I had seen enough of the monsters of Pellucidar to know that I might be facing some new and frightful Titan whose dimensions and ferocity eclipsed those of any I had seen before.  Whatever it was, it was coming slowly toward the entrance of the cave, and now, deep and forbidding, it uttered a low and ominous growl.  I waited no longer to dispute possession of the ledge with the thing which owned that voice.  The noise had not been loud--I doubt if the Sagoths heard it at all--but the suggestion of latent possibilities behind it was such that I knew it would only emanate from a gigantic and ferocious beast.  As I backed along the ledge I soon was past the mouth of the cave, where I no longer could see those fearful flaming eyes, but an instant later I caught sight of the fiendish face of a Sagoth as it warily advanced beyond the cliff's turn on the far side of the cave's mouth.  As the fellow saw me he leaped along the ledge in pursuit, and after him came as many of his companions as could crowd upon each other's heels.  At the same time the beast emerged from the cave, so that he and the Sagoths came face to face upon that narrow ledge.  The thing was an enormous cave bear, rearing its colossal bulk fully eight feet at the shoulder, while from the tip of its nose to the end of its stubby tail it was fully twelve feet in length.  As it sighted the Sagoths it emitted a most frightful roar, and with open mouth charged full upon them.  With a cry of terror the foremost gorilla-man turned to escape, but behind him he ran full upon his on-rushing companions.  The horror of the following seconds is indescribable.  The Sagoth nearest the cave bear, finding his escape blocked, turned and leaped deliberately to an awful death upon the jagged rocks three hundred feet below.  Then those giant jaws reached out and gathered in the next--there was a sickening sound of crushing bones, and the mangled corpse was dropped over the cliff's edge.  Nor did the mighty beast even pause in his steady advance along the ledge.  Shrieking Sagoths were now leaping madly over the precipice to escape him, and the last I saw he rounded the turn still pursuing the demoralized remnant of the man hunters.  For a long time I could hear the horrid roaring of the brute intermingled with the screams and shrieks of his victims, until finally the awful sounds dwindled and disappeared in the distance.  Later I learned from Ghak, who had finally come to his tribesmen and returned with a party to rescue me, that the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until it had exterminated the entire band.  Ghak was, of course, positive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature, which, within Pellucidar, is truly the king of beasts.  Not caring to venture back into the canyon, where I might fall prey either to the cave bear or the Sagoths I continued on along the ledge, believing that by following around the mountain I could reach the land of Sari from another direction.  But I evidently became confused by the twisting and turning of the canyons and gullies, for I did not come to the land of Sari then, nor for a long time thereafter.    XIV  THE GARDEN OF EDEN   WITH NO HEAVENLY GUIDE, IT IS LITTLE WONDER that I became confused and lost in the labyrinthine maze of those mighty hills.  What, in reality, I did was to pass entirely through them and come out above the valley upon the farther side.  I know that I wandered for a long time, until tired and hungry I came upon a small cave in the face of the limestone formation which had taken the place of the granite farther back.  The cave which took my fancy lay halfway up the precipitous side of a lofty cliff.  The way to it was such that I knew no extremely formidable beast could frequent it, nor was it large enough to make a comfortable habitat for any but the smaller mammals or reptiles. Yet it was with the utmost caution that I crawled within its dark interior.  Here I found a rather large chamber, lighted by a narrow cleft in the rock above which let the sunlight filter in in sufficient quantities partially to dispel the utter darkness which I had expected.  The cave was entirely empty, nor were there any signs of its having been recently occupied.  The opening was comparatively small, so that after considerable effort I was able to lug up a bowlder from the valley below which entirely blocked it.  Then I returned again to the valley for an armful of grasses and on this trip was fortunate enough to knock over an orthopi, the diminutive horse of Pellucidar, a little animal about the size of a fox terrier, which abounds in all parts of the inner world.  Thus, with food and bedding I returned to my lair, where after a meal of raw meat, to which I had now become quite accustomed, I dragged the bowlder before the entrance and curled myself upon a bed of grasses--a naked, primeval, cave man, as savagely primitive as my prehistoric progenitors.  I awoke rested but hungry, and pushing the bowlder aside crawled out upon the little rocky shelf which was my front porch.  Before me spread a small but beautiful valley, through the center of which a clear and sparkling river wound its way down to an inland sea, the blue waters of which were just visible between the two mountain ranges which embraced this little paradise.  The sides of the opposite hills were green with verdure, for a great forest clothed them to the foot of the red and yellow and copper green of the towering crags which formed their summit.  The valley itself was carpeted with a luxuriant grass, while here and there patches of wild flowers made great splashes of vivid color against the prevailing green.  Dotted over the face of the valley were little clusters of palmlike trees--three or four together as a rule.  Beneath these stood antelope, while others grazed in the open, or wandered gracefully to a nearby ford to drink.  There were several species of this beautiful animal, the most magnificent somewhat resembling the giant eland of Africa, except that their spiral horns form a complete curve backward over their ears and then forward again beneath them, ending in sharp and formidable points some two feet before the face and above the eyes.  In size they remind one of a pure bred Hereford bull, yet they are very agile and fast.  The broad yellow bands that stripe the dark roan of their coats made me take them for zebra when I first saw them.  All in all they are handsome animals, and added the finishing touch to the strange and lovely landscape that spread before my new home.  I had determined to make the cave my headquarters, and with it as a base make a systematic exploration of the surrounding country in search of the land of Sari.  First I devoured the remainder of the carcass of the orthopi I had killed before my last sleep.  Then I hid the Great Secret in a deep niche at the back of my cave, rolled the bowlder before my front door, and with bow, arrows, sword, and shield scrambled down into the peaceful valley.  The grazing herds moved to one side as I passed through them, the little orthopi evincing the greatest wariness and galloping to safest distances.  All the animals stopped feeding as I approached, and after moving to what they considered a safe distance stood contemplating me with serious eyes and up-cocked ears.  Once one of the old bull antelopes of the striped species lowered his head and bellowed angrily--even taking a few steps in my direction, so that I thought he meant to charge; but after I had passed, he resumed feeding as though nothing had disturbed him.  Near the lower end of the valley I passed a number of tapirs, and across the river saw a great sadok, the enormous double-horned progenitor of the modern rhinoceros.  At the valley's end the cliffs upon the left ran out into the sea, so that to pass around them as I desired to do it was necessary to scale them in search of a ledge along which I might continue my journey.  Some fifty feet from the base I came upon a projection which formed a natural path along the face of the cliff, and this I followed out over the sea toward the cliff's end.  Here the ledge inclined rapidly upward toward the top of the cliffs--the stratum which formed it evidently having been forced up at this steep angle when the mountains behind it were born.  As I climbed carefully up the ascent my attention suddenly was attracted aloft by the sound of strange hissing, and what resembled the flapping of wings.  And at the first glance there broke upon my horrified vision the most frightful thing I had seen even within Pellucidar.  It was a giant dragon such as is pictured in the legends and fairy tales of earth folk.  Its huge body must have measured forty feet in length, while the batlike wings that supported it in midair had a spread of fully thirty.  Its gaping jaws were armed with long, sharp teeth, and its claw equipped with horrible talons.  The hissing noise which had first attracted my attention was issuing from its throat, and seemed to be directed at something beyond and below me which I could not see.  The ledge upon which I stood terminated abruptly a few paces farther on, and as I reached the end I saw the cause of the reptile's agitation.  Some time in past ages an earthquake had produced a fault at this point, so that beyond the spot where I stood the strata had slipped down a matter of twenty feet.  The result was that the continuation of my ledge lay twenty feet below me, where it ended as abruptly as did the end upon which I stood.  And here, evidently halted in flight by this insurmountable break in the ledge, stood the object of the creature's attack--a girl cowering upon the narrow platform, her face buried in her arms, as though to shut out the sight of the frightful death which hovered just above her.  The dragon was circling lower, and seemed about to dart in upon its prey.  There was no time to be lost, scarce an instant in which to weigh the possible chances that I had against the awfully armed creature; but the sight of that frightened girl below me called out to all that was best in me, and the instinct for protection of the other sex, which nearly must have equaled the instinct of self-preservation in primeval man, drew me to the girl's side like an irresistible magnet.  Almost thoughtless of the consequences, I leaped from the end of the ledge upon which I stood, for the tiny shelf twenty feet below. At the same instant the dragon darted in toward the girl, but my sudden advent upon the scene must have startled him for he veered to one side, and then rose above us once more.  The noise I made as I landed beside her convinced the girl that the end had come, for she thought I was the dragon; but finally when no cruel fangs closed upon her she raised her eyes in astonishment. As they fell upon me the expression that came into them would be difficult to describe; but her feelings could scarcely have been one whit more complicated than my own--for the wide eyes that looked into mine were those of Dian the Beautiful.  "Dian!" I cried.  "Dian!  Thank God that I came in time."  "You?" she whispered, and then she hid her face again; nor could I tell whether she were glad or angry that I had come.  Once more the dragon was sweeping toward us, and so rapidly that I had no time to unsling my bow.  All that I could do was to snatch up a rock, and hurl it at the thing's hideous face.  Again my aim was true, and with a hiss of pain and rage the reptile wheeled once more and soared away.  Quickly I fitted an arrow now that I might be ready at the next attack, and as I did so I looked down at the girl, so that I surprised her in a surreptitious glance which she was stealing at me; but immediately, she again covered her face with her hands.  "Look at me, Dian," I pleaded.  "Are you not glad to see me?"  She looked straight into my eyes.  "I hate you," she said, and then, as I was about to beg for a fair hearing she pointed over my shoulder.  "The thipdar comes," she said, and I turned again to meet the reptile.  So this was a thipdar.  I might have known it.  The cruel bloodhound of the Mahars.  The long-extinct pterodactyl of the outer world. But this time I met it with a weapon it never had faced before.  I had selected my longest arrow, and with all my strength had bent the bow until the very tip of the shaft rested upon the thumb of my left hand, and then as the great creature darted toward us I let drive straight for that tough breast.  Hissing like the escape valve of a steam engine, the mighty creature fell turning and twisting into the sea below, my arrow buried completely in its carcass.  I turned toward the girl.  She was looking past me.  It was evident that she had seen the thipdar die.  "Dian," I said, "won't you tell me that you are not sorry that I have found you?"  "I hate you," was her only reply; but I imagined that there was less vehemence in it than before--yet it might have been but my imagination.  "Why do you hate me, Dian?" I asked, but she did not answer me.  "What are you doing here?" I asked, "and what has happened to you since Hooja freed you from the Sagoths?"  At first I thought that she was going to ignore me entirely, but finally she thought better of it.  "I was again running away from Jubal the Ugly One," she said. "After I escaped from the Sagoths I made my way alone back to my own land; but on account of Jubal I did not dare enter the villages or let any of my friends know that I had returned for fear that Jubal might find out.  By watching for a long time I found that my brother had not yet returned, and so I continued to live in a cave beside a valley which my race seldom frequents, awaiting the time that he should come back and free me from Jubal.  "But at last one of Jubal's hunters saw me as I was creeping toward my father's cave to see if my brother had yet returned and he gave the alarm and Jubal set out after me.  He has been pursuing me across many lands.  He cannot be far behind me now.  When he comes he will kill you and carry me back to his cave.  He is a terrible man.  I have gone as far as I can go, and there is no escape," and she looked hopelessly up at the continuation of the ledge twenty feet above us.  "But he shall not have me," she suddenly cried, with great vehemence. "The sea is there"--she pointed over the edge of the cliff--"and the sea shall have me rather than Jubal."  "But I have you now Dian," I cried; "nor shall Jubal, nor any other have you, for you are mine," and I seized her hand, nor did I lift it above her head and let it fall in token of release.  She had risen to her feet, and was looking straight into my eyes with level gaze.  "I do not believe you," she said, "for if you meant it you would have done this when the others were present to witness it--then I should truly have been your mate; now there is no one to see you do it, for you know that without witnesses your act does not bind you to me," and she withdrew her hand from mine and turned away.  I tried to convince her that I was sincere, but she simply couldn't forget the humiliation that I had put upon her on that other occasion.  "If you mean all that you say you will have ample chance to prove it," she said, "if Jubal does not catch and kill you.  I am in your power, and the treatment you accord me will be the best proof of your intentions toward me.  I am not your mate, and again I tell you that I hate you, and that I should be glad if I never saw you again."  Dian certainly was candid.  There was no gainsaying that.  In fact I found candor and directness to be quite a marked characteristic of the cave men of Pellucidar.  Finally I suggested that we make some attempt to gain my cave, where we might escape the searching Jubal, for I am free to admit that I had no considerable desire to meet the formidable and ferocious creature, of whose mighty prowess Dian had told me when I first met her.  He it was who, armed with a puny knife, had met and killed a cave bear in a hand-to-hand struggle.  It was Jubal who could cast his spear entirely through the armored carcass of the sadok at fifty paces.  It was he who had crushed the skull of a charging dyryth with a single blow of his war club.  No, I was not pining to meet the Ugly One-and it was quite certain that I should not go out and hunt for him; but the matter was taken out of my hands very quickly, as is often the way, and I did meet Jubal the Ugly One face to face.  This is how it happened.  I had led Dian back along the ledge the way she had come, searching for a path that would lead us to the top of the cliff, for I knew that we could then cross over to the edge of my own little valley, where I felt certain we should find a means of ingress from the cliff top.  As we proceeded along the ledge I gave Dian minute directions for finding my cave against the chance of something happening to me.  I knew that she would be quite safely hidden away from pursuit once she gained the shelter of my lair, and the valley would afford her ample means of sustenance.  Also, I was very much piqued by her treatment of me.  My heart was sad and heavy, and I wanted to make her feel badly by suggesting that something terrible might happen to me--that I might, in fact, be killed.  But it didn't work worth a cent, at least as far as I could perceive.  Dian simply shrugged those magnificent shoulders of hers, and murmured something to the effect that one was not rid of trouble so easily as that.  For a while I kept still.  I was utterly squelched.  And to think that I had twice protected her from attack--the last time risking my life to save hers.  It was incredible that even a daughter of the Stone Age could be so ungrateful--so heartless; but maybe her heart partook of the qualities of her epoch.  Presently we found a rift in the cliff which had been widened and extended by the action of the water draining through it from the plateau above.  It gave us a rather rough climb to the summit, but finally we stood upon the level mesa which stretched back for several miles to the mountain range.  Behind us lay the broad inland sea, curving upward in the horizonless distance to merge into the blue of the sky, so that for all the world it looked as though the sea lapped back to arch completely over us and disappear beyond the distant mountains at our backs--the weird and uncanny aspect of the seascapes of Pellucidar balk description.  At our right lay a dense forest, but to the left the country was open and clear to the plateau's farther verge.  It was in this direction that our way led, and we had turned to resume our journey when Dian touched my arm.  I turned to her, thinking that she was about to make peace overtures; but I was mistaken.  "Jubal," she said, and nodded toward the forest.  I looked, and there, emerging from the dense wood, came a perfect whale of a man.  He must have been seven feet tall, and proportioned accordingly.  He still was too far off to distinguish his features.  "Run," I said to Dian.  "I can engage him until you get a good start.  Maybe I can hold him until you have gotten entirely away," and then, without a backward glance, I advanced to meet the Ugly One.  I had hoped that Dian would have a kind word to say to me before she went, for she must have known that I was going to my death for her sake; but she never even so much as bid me good-bye, and it was with a heavy heart that I strode through the flower-bespangled grass to my doom.  When I had come close enough to Jubal to distinguish his features I understood how it was that he had earned the sobriquet of Ugly One.  Apparently some fearful beast had ripped away one entire side of his face.  The eye was gone, the nose, and all the flesh, so that his jaws and all his teeth were exposed and grinning through the horrible scar.  Formerly he may have been as good to look upon as the others of his handsome race, and it may be that the terrible result of this encounter had tended to sour an already strong and brutal character. However this may be it is quite certain that he was not a pretty sight, and now that his features, or what remained of them, were distorted in rage at the sight of Dian with another male, he was indeed most terrible to see--and much more terrible to meet.  He had broken into a run now, and as he advanced he raised his mighty spear, while I halted and fitting an arrow to my bow took as steady aim as I could.  I was somewhat longer than usual, for I must confess that the sight of this awful man had wrought upon my nerves to such an extent that my knees were anything but steady. What chance had I against this mighty warrior for whom even the fiercest cave bear had no terrors!  Could I hope to best one who slaughtered the sadok and dyryth singlehanded!  I shuddered; but, in fairness to myself, my fear was more for Dian than for my own fate.  And then the great brute launched his massive stone-tipped spear, and I raised my shield to break the force of its terrific velocity. The impact hurled me to my knees, but the shield had deflected the missile and I was unscathed.  Jubal was rushing upon me now with the only remaining weapon that he carried--a murderous-looking knife. He was too close for a careful bowshot, but I let drive at him as he came, without taking aim.  My arrow pierced the fleshy part of his thigh, inflicting a painful but not disabling wound.  And then he was upon me.  My agility saved me for the instant.  I ducked beneath his raised arm, and when he wheeled to come at me again he found a sword's point in his face.  And a moment later he felt an inch or two of it in the muscles of his knife arm, so that thereafter he went more warily.  It was a duel of strategy now--the great, hairy man maneuvering to get inside my guard where he could bring those giant thews to play, while my wits were directed to the task of keeping him at arm's length.  Thrice he rushed me, and thrice I caught his knife blow upon my shield.  Each time my sword found his body--once penetrating to his lung.  He was covered with blood by this time, and the internal hemorrhage induced paroxysms of coughing that brought the red stream through the hideous mouth and nose, covering his face and breast with bloody froth.  He was a most unlovely spectacle, but he was far from dead.  As the duel continued I began to gain confidence, for, to be perfectly candid, I had not expected to survive the first rush of that monstrous engine of ungoverned rage and hatred.  And I think that Jubal, from utter contempt of me, began to change to a feeling of respect, and then in his primitive mind there evidently loomed the thought that perhaps at last he had met his master, and was facing his end.  At any rate it is only upon this hypothesis that I can account for his next act, which was in the nature of a last resort--a sort of forlorn hope, which could only have been born of the belief that if he did not kill me quickly I should kill him.  It happened on the occasion of his fourth charge, when, instead of striking at me with his knife, he dropped that weapon, and seizing my sword blade in both his hands wrenched the weapon from my grasp as easily as from a babe.  Flinging it far to one side he stood motionless for just an instant glaring into my face with such a horrid leer of malignant triumph as to almost unnerve me--then he sprang for me with his bare hands. But it was Jubal's day to learn new methods of warfare.  For the first time he had seen a bow and arrows, never before that duel had he beheld a sword, and now he learned what a man who knows may do with his bare fists.  As he came for me, like a great bear, I ducked again beneath his outstretched arm, and as I came up planted as clean a blow upon his jaw as ever you have seen.  Down went that great mountain of flesh sprawling upon the ground.  He was so surprised and dazed that he lay there for several seconds before he made any attempt to rise, and I stood over him with another dose ready when he should gain his knees.  Up he came at last, almost roaring in his rage and mortification; but he didn't stay up--I let him have a left fair on the point of the jaw that sent him tumbling over on his back.  By this time I think Jubal had gone mad with hate, for no sane man would have come back for more as many times as he did.  Time after time I bowled him over as fast as he could stagger up, until toward the last he lay longer on the ground between blows, and each time came up weaker than before.  He was bleeding very profusely now from the wound in his lungs, and presently a terrific blow over the heart sent him reeling heavily to the ground, where he lay very still, and somehow I knew at once that Jubal the Ugly One would never get up again.  But even as I looked upon that massive body lying there so grim and terrible in death, I could not believe that I, single-handed, had bested this slayer of fearful beasts--this gigantic ogre of the Stone Age.  Picking up my sword I leaned upon it, looking down on the dead body of my foeman, and as I thought of the battle I had just fought and won a great idea was born in my brain--the outcome of this and the suggestion that Perry had made within the city of Phutra.  If skill and science could render a comparative pygmy the master of this mighty brute, what could not the brute's fellows accomplish with the same skill and science.  Why all Pellucidar would be at their feet--and I would be their king and Dian their queen.  Dian!  A little wave of doubt swept over me.  It was quite within the possibilities of Dian to look down upon me even were I king. She was quite the most superior person I ever had met--with the most convincing way of letting you know that she was superior.  Well, I could go to the cave, and tell her that I had killed Jubal, and then she might feel more kindly toward me, since I had freed her of her tormentor.  I hoped that she had found the cave easily--it would be terrible had I lost her again, and I turned to gather up my shield and bow to hurry after her, when to my astonishment I found her standing not ten paces behind me.  "Girl!" I cried, "what are you doing here?  I thought that you had gone to the cave, as I told you to do."  Up went her head, and the look that she gave me took all the majesty out of me, and left me feeling more like the palace janitor--if palaces have janitors.  "As you told me to do!" she cried, stamping her little foot.  "I do as I please.  I am the daughter of a king, and furthermore, I hate you."  I was dumbfounded--this was my thanks for saving her from Jubal! I turned and looked at the corpse.  "May be that I saved you from a worse fate, old man," I said, but I guess it was lost on Dian, for she never seemed to notice it at all.  "Let us go to my cave," I said, "I am tired and hungry."  She followed along a pace behind me, neither of us speaking.  I was too angry, and she evidently didn't care to converse with the lower orders.  I was mad all the way through, as I had certainly felt that at least a word of thanks should have rewarded me, for I knew that even by her own standards, I must have done a very wonderful thing to have killed the redoubtable Jubal in a hand-to-hand encounter.  We had no difficulty in finding my lair, and then I went down into the valley and bowled over a small antelope, which I dragged up the steep ascent to the ledge before the door.  Here we ate in silence. Occasionally I glanced at her, thinking that the sight of her tearing at raw flesh with her hands and teeth like some wild animal would cause a revulsion of my sentiments toward her; but to my surprise I found that she ate quite as daintily as the most civilized woman of my acquaintance, and finally I found myself gazing in foolish rapture at the beauties of her strong, white teeth.  Such is love.  After our repast we went down to the river together and bathed our hands and faces, and then after drinking our fill went back to the cave.  Without a word I crawled into the farthest corner and, curling up, was soon asleep.  When I awoke I found Dian sitting in the doorway looking out across the valley.  As I came out she moved to one side to let me pass, but she had no word for me.  I wanted to hate her, but I couldn't. Every time I looked at her something came up in my throat, so that I nearly choked.  I had never been in love before, but I did not need any aid in diagnosing my case--I certainly had it and had it bad.  God, how I loved that beautiful, disdainful, tantalizing, prehistoric girl!  After we had eaten again I asked Dian if she intended returning to her tribe now that Jubal was dead, but she shook her head sadly, and said that she did not dare, for there was still Jubal's brother to be considered--his oldest brother.  "What has he to do with it?" I asked.  "Does he too want you, or has the option on you become a family heirloom, to be passed on down from generation to generation?"  She was not quite sure as to what I meant.  "It is probable," she said, "that they all will want revenge for the death of Jubal--there are seven of them--seven terrible men. Someone may have to kill them all, if I am to return to my people."  It began to look as though I had assumed a contract much too large for me--about seven sizes, in fact.  "Had Jubal any cousins?" I asked.  It was just as well to know the worst at once.  "Yes," replied Dian, "but they don't count--they all have mates. Jubal's brothers have no mates because Jubal could get none for himself.  He was so ugly that women ran away from him--some have even thrown themselves from the cliffs of Amoz into the Darel Az rather than mate with the Ugly One."  "But what had that to do with his brothers?" I asked.  "I forget that you are not of Pellucidar," said Dian, with a look of pity mixed with contempt, and the contempt seemed to be laid on a little thicker than the circumstance warranted--as though to make quite certain that I shouldn't overlook it.  "You see," she continued, "a younger brother may not take a mate until all his older brothers have done so, unless the older brother waives his prerogative, which Jubal would not do, knowing that as long as he kept them single they would be all the keener in aiding him to secure a mate."  Noticing that Dian was becoming more communicative I began to entertain hopes that she might be warming up toward me a bit, although upon what slender thread I hung my hopes I soon discovered.  "As you dare not return to Amoz," I ventured, "what is to become of you since you cannot be happy here with me, hating me as you do?"  "I shall have to put up with you," she replied coldly, "until you see fit to go elsewhere and leave me in peace, then I shall get along very well alone."  I looked at her in utter amazement.  It seemed incredible that even a prehistoric woman could be so cold and heartless and ungrateful. Then I arose.  "I shall leave you NOW," I said haughtily, "I have had quite enough of your ingratitude and your insults," and then I turned and strode majestically down toward the valley.  I had taken a hundred steps in absolute silence, and then Dian spoke.  "I hate you!" she shouted, and her voice broke--in rage, I thought.  I was absolutely miserable, but I hadn't gone too far when I began to realize that I couldn't leave her alone there without protection, to hunt her own food amid the dangers of that savage world.  She might hate me, and revile me, and heap indignity after indignity upon me, as she already had, until I should have hated her; but the pitiful fact remained that I loved her, and I couldn't leave her there alone.  The more I thought about it the madder I got, so that by the time I reached the valley I was furious, and the result of it was that I turned right around and went up that cliff again as fast as I had come down.  I saw that Dian had left the ledge and gone within the cave, but I bolted right in after her.  She was lying upon her face on the pile of grasses I had gathered for her bed.  When she heard me enter she sprang to her feet like a tigress.  "I hate you!" she cried.  Coming from the brilliant light of the noonday sun into the semidarkness of the cave I could not see her features, and I was rather glad, for I disliked to think of the hate that I should have read there.  I never said a word to her at first.  I just strode across the cave and grasped her by the wrists, and when she struggled, I put my arm around her so as to pinion her hands to her sides.  She fought like a tigress, but I took my free hand and pushed her head back--I imagine that I had suddenly turned brute, that I had gone back a thousand million years, and was again a veritable cave man taking my mate by force--and then I kissed that beautiful mouth again and again.  "Dian," I cried, shaking her roughly, "I love you.  Can't you understand that I love you?  That I love you better than all else in this world or my own?  That I am going to have you?  That love like mine cannot be denied?"  I noticed that she lay very still in my arms now, and as my eyes became accustomed to the light I saw that she was smiling--a very contented, happy smile.  I was thunderstruck.  Then I realized that, very gently, she was trying to disengage her arms, and I loosened my grip upon them so that she could do so.  Slowly they came up and stole about my neck, and then she drew my lips down to hers once more and held them there for a long time.  At last she spoke.  "Why didn't you do this at first, David?  I have been waiting so long."  "What!" I cried.  "You said that you hated me!"  "Did you expect me to run into your arms, and say that I loved you before I knew that you loved me?" she asked.  "But I have told you right along that I love you," I said.  "Love speaks in acts," she replied.  "You could have made your mouth say what you wished it to say, but just now when you came and took me in your arms your heart spoke to mine in the language that a woman's heart understands.  What a silly man you are, David?"  "Then you haven't hated me at all, Dian?" I asked.  "I have loved you always," she whispered, "from the first moment that I saw you, although I did not know it until that time you struck down Hooja the Sly One, and then spurned me."  "But I didn't spurn you, dear," I cried.  "I didn't know your ways--I doubt if I do now.  It seems incredible that you could have reviled me so, and yet have cared for me all the time."  "You might have known," she said, "when I did not run away from you that it was not hate which chained me to you.  While you were battling with Jubal, I could have run to the edge of the forest, and when I learned the outcome of the combat it would have been a simple thing to have eluded you and returned to my own people."  "But Jubal's brothers--and cousins--" I reminded her, "how about them?"  She smiled, and hid her face on my shoulder.  "I had to tell you SOMETHING, David," she whispered.  "I must needs have SOME excuse for remaining near you."  "You little sinner!" I exclaimed.  "And you have caused me all this anguish for nothing!"  "I have suffered even more," she answered simply, "for I thought that you did not love me, and I was helpless.  I couldn't come to you and demand that my love be returned, as you have just come to me.  Just now when you went away hope went with you.  I was wretched, terrified, miserable, and my heart was breaking.  I wept, and I have not done that before since my mother died," and now I saw that there was the moisture of tears about her eyes.  It was near to making me cry myself when I thought of all that poor child had been through.  Motherless and unprotected; hunted across a savage, primeval world by that hideous brute of a man; exposed to the attacks of the countless fearsome denizens of its mountains, its plains, and its jungles--it was a miracle that she had survived it all.  To me it was a revelation of the things my early forebears must have endured that the human race of the outer crust might survive. It made me very proud to think that I had won the love of such a woman.  Of course she couldn't read or write; there was nothing cultured or refined about her as you judge culture and refinement; but she was the essence of all that is best in woman, for she was good, and brave, and noble, and virtuous.  And she was all these things in spite of the fact that their observance entailed suffering and danger and possible death.  How much easier it would have been to have gone to Jubal in the first place!  She would have been his lawful mate.  She would have been queen in her own land--and it meant just as much to the cave woman to be a queen in the Stone Age as it does to the woman of today to be a queen now; it's all comparative glory any way you look at it, and if there were only half-naked savages on the outer crust today, you'd find that it would be considerable glory to be the wife a Dahomey chief.  I couldn't help but compare Dian's action with that of a splendid young woman I had known in New York--I mean splendid to look at and to talk to.  She had been head over heels in love with a chum of mine--a clean, manly chap--but she had married a broken-down, disreputable old debauchee because he was a count in some dinky little European principality that was not even accorded a distinctive color by Rand McNally.  Yes, I was mighty proud of Dian.  After a time we decided to set out for Sari, as I was anxious to see Perry, and to know that all was right with him.  I had told Dian about our plan of emancipating the human race of Pellucidar, and she was fairly wild over it.  She said that if Dacor, her brother, would only return he could easily be king of Amoz, and that then he and Ghak could form an alliance.  That would give us a flying start, for the Sarians and the Amozites were both very powerful tribes.  Once they had been armed with swords, and bows and arrows, and trained in their use we were confident that they could overcome any tribe that seemed disinclined to join the great army of federated states with which we were planning to march upon the Mahars.  I explained the various destructive engines of war which Perry and I could construct after a little experimentation--gunpowder, rifles, cannon, and the like, and Dian would clap her hands, and throw her arms about my neck, and tell me what a wonderful thing I was.  She was beginning to think that I was omnipotent although I really hadn't done anything but talk--but that is the way with women when they love.  Perry used to say that if a fellow was one-tenth as remarkable as his wife or mother thought him, he would have the world by the tail with a down-hill drag.  The first time we started for Sari I stepped into a nest of poisonous vipers before we reached the valley.  A little fellow stung me on the ankle, and Dian made me come back to the cave.  She said that I mustn't exercise, or it might prove fatal--if it had been a full-grown snake that struck me she said, I wouldn't have moved a single pace from the nest--I'd have died in my tracks, so virulent is the poison.  As it was I must have been laid up for quite a while, though Dian's poultices of herbs and leaves finally reduced the swelling and drew out the poison.  The episode proved most fortunate, however, as it gave me an idea which added a thousand-fold to the value of my arrows as missiles of offense and defense.  As soon as I was able to be about again, I sought out some adult vipers of the species which had stung me, and having killed them, I extracted their virus, smearing it upon the tips of several arrows.  Later I shot a hyaenodon with one of these, and though my arrow inflicted but a superficial flesh wound the beast crumpled in death almost immediately after he was hit.  We now set out once more for the land of the Sarians, and it was with feelings of sincere regret that we bade good-bye to our beautiful Garden of Eden, in the comparative peace and harmony of which we had lived the happiest moments of our lives.  How long we had been there I did not know, for as I have told you, time had ceased to exist for me beneath that eternal noonday sun--it may have been an hour, or a month of earthly time; I do not know.    XV  BACK TO EARTH   WE CROSSED THE RIVER AND PASSED THROUGH THE mountains beyond, and finally we came out upon a great level plain which stretched away as far as the eye could reach.  I cannot tell you in what direction it stretched even if you would care to know, for all the while that I was within Pellucidar I never discovered any but local methods of indicating direction--there is no north, no south, no east, no west.  UP is about the only direction which is well defined, and that, of course, is DOWN to you of the outer crust.  Since the sun neither rises nor sets there is no method of indicating direction beyond visible objects such as high mountains, forests, lakes, and seas.  The plain which lies beyond the white cliffs which flank the Darel Az upon the shore nearest the Mountains of the Clouds is about as near to any direction as any Pellucidarian can come.  If you happen not to have heard of the Darel Az, or the white cliffs, or the Mountains of the Clouds you feel that there is something lacking, and long for the good old understandable northeast and southwest of the outer world.  We had barely entered the great plain when we discovered two enormous animals approaching us from a great distance.  So far were they that we could not distinguish what manner of beasts they might be, but as they came closer, I saw that they were enormous quadrupeds, eighty or a hundred feet long, with tiny heads perched at the top of very long necks.  Their heads must have been quite forty feet from the ground.  The beasts moved very slowly--that is their action was slow--but their strides covered such a great distance that in reality they traveled considerably faster than a man walks.  As they drew still nearer we discovered that upon the back of each sat a human being.  Then Dian knew what they were, though she never before had seen one.  "They are lidis from the land of the Thorians," she cried.  "Thoria lies at the outer verge of the Land of Awful Shadow.  The Thorians alone of all the races of Pellucidar ride the lidi, for nowhere else than beside the dark country are they found."  "What is the Land of Awful Shadow?" I asked.  "It is the land which lies beneath the Dead World," replied Dian; "the Dead World which hangs forever between the sun and Pellucidar above the Land of Awful Shadow.  It is the Dead World which makes the great shadow upon this portion of Pellucidar."  I did not fully understand what she meant, nor am I sure that I do yet, for I have never been to that part of Pellucidar from which the Dead World is visible; but Perry says that it is the moon of Pellucidar--a tiny planet within a planet--and that it revolves around the earth's axis coincidently with the earth, and thus is always above the same spot within Pellucidar.  I remember that Perry was very much excited when I told him about this Dead World, for he seemed to think that it explained the hitherto inexplicable phenomena of nutation and the precession of the equinoxes.  When the two upon the lidis had come quite close to us we saw that one was a man and the other a woman.  The former had held up his two hands, palms toward us, in sign of peace, and I had answered him in kind, when he suddenly gave a cry of astonishment and pleasure, and slipping from his enormous mount ran forward toward Dian, throwing his arms about her.  In an instant I was white with jealousy, but only for an instant; since Dian quickly drew the man toward me, telling him that I was David, her mate.  "And this is my brother, Dacor the Strong One, David," she said to me.  It appeared that the woman was Dacor's mate.  He had found none to his liking among the Sari, nor farther on until he had come to the land of the Thoria, and there he had found and fought for this very lovely Thorian maiden whom he was bringing back to his own people.  When they had heard our story and our plans they decided to accompany us to Sari, that Dacor and Ghak might come to an agreement relative to an alliance, as Dacor was quite as enthusiastic about the proposed annihilation of the Mahars and Sagoths as either Dian or I.  After a journey which was, for Pellucidar, quite uneventful, we came to the first of the Sarian villages which consists of between one and two hundred artificial caves cut into the face of a great cliff.  Here to our immense delight, we found both Perry and Ghak. The old man was quite overcome at sight of me for he had long since given me up as dead.  When I introduced Dian as my wife, he didn't quite know what to say, but he afterward remarked that with the pick of two worlds I could not have done better.  Ghak and Dacor reached a very amicable arrangement, and it was at a council of the head men of the various tribes of the Sari that the eventual form of government was tentatively agreed upon.  Roughly, the various kingdoms were to remain virtually independent, but there was to be one great overlord, or emperor.  It was decided that I should be the first of the dynasty of the emperors of Pellucidar.  We set about teaching the women how to make bows and arrows, and poison pouches.  The young men hunted the vipers which provided the virus, and it was they who mined the iron ore, and fashioned the swords under Perry's direction.  Rapidly the fever spread from one tribe to another until representatives from nations so far distant that the Sarians had never even heard of them came in to take the oath of allegiance which we required, and to learn the art of making the new weapons and using them.  We sent our young men out as instructors to every nation of the federation, and the movement had reached colossal proportions before the Mahars discovered it.  The first intimation they had was when three of their great slave caravans were annihilated in rapid succession.  They could not comprehend that the lower orders had suddenly developed a power which rendered them really formidable.  In one of the skirmishes with slave caravans some of our Sarians took a number of Sagoth prisoners, and among them were two who had been members of the guards within the building where we had been confined at Phutra.  They told us that the Mahars were frantic with rage when they discovered what had taken place in the cellars of the buildings.  The Sagoths knew that something very terrible had befallen their masters, but the Mahars had been most careful to see that no inkling of the true nature of their vital affliction reached beyond their own race.  How long it would take for the race to become extinct it was impossible even to guess; but that this must eventually happen seemed inevitable.  The Mahars had offered fabulous rewards for the capture of any one of us alive, and at the same time had threatened to inflict the direst punishment upon whomever should harm us.  The Sagoths could not understand these seemingly paradoxical instructions, though their purpose was quite evident to me.  The Mahars wanted the Great Secret, and they knew that we alone could deliver it to them.  Perry's experiments in the manufacture of gunpowder and the fashioning of rifles had not progressed as rapidly as we had hoped--there was a whole lot about these two arts which Perry didn't know.  We were both assured that the solution of these problems would advance the cause of civilization within Pellucidar thousands of years at a single stroke.  Then there were various other arts and sciences which we wished to introduce, but our combined knowledge of them did not embrace the mechanical details which alone could render them of commercial, or practical value.  "David," said Perry, immediately after his latest failure to produce gunpowder that would even burn, "one of us must return to the outer world and bring back the information we lack.  Here we have all the labor and materials for reproducing anything that ever has been produced above--what we lack is knowledge.  Let us go back and get that knowledge in the shape of books--then this world will indeed be at our feet."  And so it was decided that I should return in the prospector, which still lay upon the edge of the forest at the point where we had first penetrated to the surface of the inner world.  Dian would not listen to any arrangement for my going which did not include her, and I was not sorry that she wished to accompany me, for I wanted her to see my world, and I wanted my world to see her.  With a large force of men we marched to the great iron mole, which Perry soon had hoisted into position with its nose pointed back toward the outer crust.  He went over all the machinery carefully. He replenished the air tanks, and manufactured oil for the engine. At last everything was ready, and we were about to set out when our pickets, a long, thin line of which had surrounded our camp at all times, reported that a great body of what appeared to be Sagoths and Mahars were approaching from the direction of Phutra.  Dian and I were ready to embark, but I was anxious to witness the first clash between two fair-sized armies of the opposing races of Pellucidar.  I realized that this was to mark the historic beginning of a mighty struggle for possession of a world, and as the first emperor of Pellucidar I felt that it was not alone my duty, but my right, to be in the thick of that momentous struggle.  As the opposing army approached we saw that there were many Mahars with the Sagoth troops--an indication of the vast importance which the dominant race placed upon the outcome of this campaign, for it was not customary with them to take active part in the sorties which their creatures made for slaves--the only form of warfare which they waged upon the lower orders.  Ghak and Dacor were both with us, having come primarily to view the prospector.  I placed Ghak with some of his Sarians on the right of our battle line.  Dacor took the left, while I commanded the center. Behind us I stationed a sufficient reserve under one of Ghak's head men.  The Sagoths advanced steadily with menacing spears, and I let them come until they were within easy bowshot before I gave the word to fire.  At the first volley of poison-tipped arrows the front ranks of the gorilla-men crumpled to the ground; but those behind charged over the prostrate forms of their comrades in a wild, mad rush to be upon us with their spears.  A second volley stopped them for an instant, and then my reserve sprang through the openings in the firing line to engage them with sword and shield.  The clumsy spears of the Sagoths were no match for the swords of the Sarian and Amozite, who turned the spear thrusts aside with their shields and leaped to close quarters with their lighter, handier weapons.  Ghak took his archers along the enemy's flank, and while the swordsmen engaged them in front, he poured volley after volley into their unprotected left.  The Mahars did little real fighting, and were more in the way than otherwise, though occasionally one of them would fasten its powerful jaw upon the arm or leg of a Sarian.  The battle did not last a great while, for when Dacor and I led our men in upon the Sagoth's right with naked swords they were already so demoralized that they turned and fled before us.  We pursued them for some time, taking many prisoners and recovering nearly a hundred slaves, among whom was Hooja the Sly One.  He told me that he had been captured while on his way to his own land; but that his life had been spared in hope that through him the Mahars would learn the whereabouts of their Great Secret.  Ghak and I were inclined to think that the Sly One had been guiding this expedition to the land of Sari, where he thought that the book might be found in Perry's possession; but we had no proof of this and so we took him in and treated him as one of us, although none liked him.  And how he rewarded my generosity you will presently learn.  There were a number of Mahars among our prisoners, and so fearful were our own people of them that they would not approach them unless completely covered from the sight of the reptiles by a piece of skin.  Even Dian shared the popular superstition regarding the evil effects of exposure to the eyes of angry Mahars, and though I laughed at her fears I was willing enough to humor them if it would relieve her apprehension in any degree, and so she sat apart from the prospector, near which the Mahars had been chained, while Perry and I again inspected every portion of the mechanism.  At last I took my place in the driving seat, and called to one of the men without to fetch Dian.  It happened that Hooja stood quite close to the doorway of the prospector, so that it was he who, without my knowledge, went to bring her; but how he succeeded in accomplishing the fiendish thing he did, I cannot guess, unless there were others in the plot to aid him.  Nor can I believe that, since all my people were loyal to me and would have made short work of Hooja had he suggested the heartless scheme, even had he had time to acquaint another with it.  It was all done so quickly that I may only believe that it was the result of sudden impulse, aided by a number of, to Hooja, fortuitous circumstances occurring at precisely the right moment.  All I know is that it was Hooja who brought Dian to the prospector, still wrapped from head to toe in the skin of an enormous cave lion which covered her since the Mahar prisoners had been brought into camp.  He deposited his burden in the seat beside me.  I was all ready to get under way.  The good-byes had been said.  Perry had grasped my hand in the last, long farewell.  I closed and barred the outer and inner doors, took my seat again at the driving mechanism, and pulled the starting lever.  As before on that far-gone night that had witnessed our first trial of the iron monster, there was a frightful roaring beneath us--the giant frame trembled and vibrated--there was a rush of sound as the loose earth passed up through the hollow space between the inner and outer jackets to be deposited in our wake.  Once more the thing was off.  But on the instant of departure I was nearly thrown from my seat by the sudden lurching of the prospector.  At first I did not realize what had happened, but presently it dawned upon me that just before entering the crust the towering body had fallen through its supporting scaffolding, and that instead of entering the ground vertically we were plunging into it at a different angle.  Where it would bring us out upon the upper crust I could not even conjecture. And then I turned to note the effect of this strange experience upon Dian.  She still sat shrouded in the great skin.  "Come, come," I cried, laughing, "come out of your shell.  No Mahar eyes can reach you here," and I leaned over and snatched the lion skin from her.  And then I shrank back upon my seat in utter horror.  The thing beneath the skin was not Dian--it was a hideous Mahar. Instantly I realized the trick that Hooja had played upon me, and the purpose of it.  Rid of me, forever as he doubtless thought, Dian would be at his mercy.  Frantically I tore at the steering wheel in an effort to turn the prospector back toward Pellucidar; but, as on that other occasion, I could not budge the thing a hair.  It is needless to recount the horrors or the monotony of that journey. It varied but little from the former one which had brought us from the outer to the inner world.  Because of the angle at which we had entered the ground the trip required nearly a day longer, and brought me out here upon the sand of the Sahara instead of in the United States as I had hoped.  For months I have been waiting here for a white man to come.  I dared not leave the prospector for fear I should never be able to find it again--the shifting sands of the desert would soon cover it, and then my only hope of returning to my Dian and her Pellucidar would be gone forever.  That I ever shall see her again seems but remotely possible, for how may I know upon what part of Pellucidar my return journey may terminate--and how, without a north or south or an east or a west may I hope ever to find my way across that vast world to the tiny spot where my lost love lies grieving for me?   That is the story as David Innes told it to me in the goat-skin tent upon the rim of the great Sahara Desert.  The next day he took me out to see the prospector--it was precisely as he had described it. So huge was it that it could have been brought to this inaccessible part of the world by no means of transportation that existed there--it could only have come in the way that David Innes said it came--up through the crust of the earth from the inner world of Pellucidar.  I spent a week with him, and then, abandoned my lion hunt, returned directly to the coast and hurried to London where I purchased a great quantity of stuff which he wished to take back to Pellucidar with him.  There were books, rifles, revolvers, ammunition, cameras, chemicals, telephones, telegraph instruments, wire, tool and more books--books upon every subject under the sun.  He said he wanted a library with which they could reproduce the wonders of the twentieth century in the Stone Age and if quantity counts for anything I got it for him.  I took the things back to Algeria myself, and accompanied them to the end of the railroad; but from here I was recalled to America upon important business.  However, I was able to employ a very trustworthy man to take charge of the caravan--the same guide, in fact, who had accompanied me on the previous trip into the Sahara--and after writing a long letter to Innes in which I gave him my American address, I saw the expedition head south.  Among the other things which I sent to Innes was over five hundred miles of double, insulated wire of a very fine gauge.  I had it packed on a special reel at his suggestion, as it was his idea that he could fasten one end here before he left and by paying it out through the end of the prospector lay a telegraph line between the outer and inner worlds.  In my letter I told him to be sure to mark the terminus of the line very plainly with a high cairn, in case I was not able to reach him before he set out, so that I might easily find and communicate with him should he be so fortunate as to reach Pellucidar.  I received several letters from him after I returned to America--in fact he took advantage of every northward-passing caravan to drop me word of some sort.  His last letter was written the day before he intended to depart.  Here it is.   MY DEAR FRIEND:  Tomorrow I shall set out in quest of Pellucidar and Dian.  That is if the Arabs don't get me.  They have been very nasty of late.  I don't know the cause, but on two occasions they have threatened my life.  One, more friendly than the rest, told me today that they intended attacking me tonight.  It would be unfortunate should anything of that sort happen now that I am so nearly ready to depart.  However, maybe I will be as well off, for the nearer the hour approaches, the slenderer my chances for success appear.  Here is the friendly Arab who is to take this letter north for me, so good-bye, and God bless you for your kindness to me.  The Arab tells me to hurry, for he sees a cloud of sand to the south--he thinks it is the party coming to murder me, and he doesn't want to be found with me.  So good-bye again.  Yours,  DAVID INNES.   A year later found me at the end of the railroad once more, headed for the spot where I had left Innes.  My first disappointment was when I discovered that my old guide had died within a few weeks of my return, nor could I find any member of my former party who could lead me to the same spot.  For months I searched that scorching land, interviewing countless desert sheiks in the hope that at last I might find one who had heard of Innes and his wonderful iron mole.  Constantly my eyes scanned the blinding waste of sand for the ricky cairn beneath which I was to find the wires leading to Pellucidar--but always was I unsuccessful.  And always do these awful questions harass me when I think of David Innes and his strange adventures.  Did the Arabs murder him, after all, just on the eve of his departure? Or, did he again turn the nose of his iron monster toward the inner world?  Did he reach it, or lies he somewhere buried in the heart of the great crust?  And if he did come again to Pellucidar was it to break through into the bottom of one of her great island seas, or among some savage race far, far from the land of his heart's desire?  Does the answer lie somewhere upon the bosom of the broad Sahara, at the end of two tiny wires, hidden beneath a lost cairn?  I wonder. PREFATORY:  THE LEGATEES OF DEUCALION   We were both of us not a little stiff as the result of sleeping out in the open all that night, for even in Grand Canary the dew-fall and the comparative chill of darkness are not to be trifled with.  For myself on these occasions I like a bit of a run as an early refresher.  But here on this rough ground in the middle of the island there were not three yards of level to be found, and so as Coppinger proceeded to go through some sort of dumb-bell exercises with a couple of lumps of bristly lava, I followed his example.  Coppinger has done a good deal of roughing it in his time, but being a doctor of medicine amongst other things--he takes out a new degree of some sort on an average every other year--he is great on health theories, and practises them like a religion.  There had been rain two days before, and as there was still a bit of stream trickling along at the bottom of the barranca, we went down there and had a wash, and brushed our teeth.  Greatest luxury imaginable, a toothbrush, on this sort of expedition.  "Now," said Coppinger when we had emptied our pockets, "there's precious little grub left, and it's none the better for being carried in a local Spanish newspaper."  "Yours is mostly tobacco ashes."  "It'll get worse if we leave it.  We've a lot more bad scrambling ahead of us."  That was obvious.  So we sat down beside the stream there at the bottom of the barranca, and ate up all of what was left.  It was a ten-mile tramp to the fonda at Santa Brigida, where we had set down our traps; and as Coppinger wanted to take a lot more photographs and measurements before we left this particular group of caves, it was likely we should be pretty sharp set before we got our next meal, and our next taste of the PATRON'S splendid old country wine.  My faith!  If only they knew down in the English hotels in Las Palmas what magnificent wines one could get--with diplomacy--up in some of the mountain villages, the old vintage would become a thing of the past in a week.  Now to tell the truth, the two mummies he had gathered already quite satisfied my small ambition.  The goatskins in which they were sewn up were as brittle as paper, and the poor old things themselves gave out dust like a puffball whenever they were touched.  But you know what Coppinger is.  He thought he'd come upon traces of an old Guanche university, or sacred college, or something of that kind, like the one there is on the other side of the island, and he wouldn't be satisfied till he'd ransacked every cave in the whole face of the cliff.  He'd plenty of stuff left for the flashlight thing, and twenty-eight more films in his kodak, and said we might as well get through with the job then as make a return journey all on purpose.  So he took the crowbar, and I shouldered the rope, and away we went up to the ridge of the cliff, where we had got such a baking from the sun the day before.  Of course these caves were not easy to come at, or else they would have been raided years before.  Coppinger, who on principle makes out he knows all about these things, says that in the old Guanche days they had ladders of goatskin rope which they could pull up when they were at home, and so keep out undesirable callers; and as no other plan occurs to me, perhaps he may be right.  Anyway the mouths of the caves were in a more or less level row thirty feet below the ridge of the cliff, and fifty feet above the bottom; and Spanish curiosity doesn't go in much where it cannot walk.  Now laddering such caves from below would have been cumbersome, but a light knotted rope is easily carried, and though it would have been hard to climb up this, our plan was to descend on each cave mouth from above, and then slip down to the foot of the cliffs, and start again AB INITIO for the next.  Coppinger is plucky enough, and he has a good head on a height, but there is no getting over the fact that he is portly and nearer fifty than forty-five.  So you can see he must have been pretty keen.  Of course I went first each time, and got into the cave mouth, and did what I could to help him in; but when you have to walk down a vertical cliff face fly-fashion, with only a thin bootlace of a rope for support, it is not much real help the man below can give, except offer you his best wishes.  I wanted to save him as much as I could, and as the first three caves I climbed to were small and empty, seeming to be merely store-places, I asked him to take them for granted, and save himself the rest.  But he insisted on clambering down to each one in person, and as he decided that one of my granaries was a prison, and another a pot-making factory, and another a schoolroom for young priests, he naturally said he hadn't much reliance on my judgment, and would have to go through the whole lot himself.  You know what these thorough-going archaeologists are for imagination.  But as the day went on, and the sun rose higher, Coppinger began clearly to have had enough of it, though he was very game, and insisted on going on much longer than was safe.  I must say I didn't like it.  You see the drop was seldom less than eighty feet from the top of the cliffs.  However, at last he was forced to give it up.  I suggested marching off to Santa Brigida forthwith, but he wouldn't do that.  There were three more cave-openings to be looked into, and if I wouldn't do them for him, he would have to make another effort to get there himself.  He tried to make out he was conferring a very great favour on me by offering to take a report solely from my untrained observation, but I flatly refused to look at it in that light.  I was pretty tired also; I was soaked with perspiration from the heat; my head ached from the violence of the sun; and my hands were cut raw with the rope.  Coppinger might be tired, but he was still enthusiastic.  He tried to make me enthusiastic also.  "Look here," he said, "there's no knowing what you may find up there, and if you do lay hands on anything, remember it's your own.  I shall have no claim whatever."  "Very kind of you, but I've got no use for any more mummies done up in goatskin bags."  "Bah!  That's not a burial cave up there.  Don't you know the difference yet in the openings?  Now, be a good fellow.  It doesn't follow that because we have drawn all the rest blank, you won't stumble across a good find for yourself up there."  "Oh, very well," I said, as he seemed so set on it; and away I stumbled over the fallen rocks, and along the ledge, and then scrambled up by that fissure in the cliff which saved us the two-mile round which we had had to take at first.  I wrenched out the crowbar, and jammed it down in a new place, and then away I went over the side, with hands smarting worse at every new grip of the rope.  It was an awkward job swinging into the cave mouth because the rock above overhung, or else (what came to the same thing) it had broken away below; but I managed it somehow, although I landed with an awkward thump on my back, and at the same time I didn't let go the rope.  It wouldn't do to have lost the rope then: Coppinger couldn't have flicked it into me from where he was below.  Now from the first glance I could see that this cave was of different structure to the others.  They were for the most part mere dens, rounded out anyhow; this had been faced up with cutting tools, so that all the angles were clean, and the sides smooth and flat.  The walls inclined inwards to the roof, reminding me of an architecture I had seen before but could not recollect where, and moreover there were several rooms connected up with passages.  I was pleased to find that the other cave-openings which Coppinger wanted me to explore were merely the windows or the doorways of two of these other rooms.  Of inscriptions or markings on the walls there was not a trace, though I looked carefully, and except for bats the place was entirely bare.  I lit a cigarette and smoked it through--Coppinger always thinks one is slurring over work if it is got through too quickly--and then I went to the entrance where the rope was, and leaned out, and shouted down my news.  He turned up a very anxious face.  "Have you searched it thoroughly?" he bawled back.  "Of course I have.  What do you think I've been doing all this time?"  "No, don't come down yet.  Wait a minute.  I say, old man, do wait a minute.  I'm making fast the kodak and the flashlight apparatus on the end of the rope.  Pull them up, and just make me half a dozen exposures, there's a good fellow."  "Oh, all right," I said, and hauled the things up, and got them inside.  The photographs would be absolutely dull and uninteresting, but that wouldn't matter to Coppinger.  He rather preferred them that way.  One has to be careful about halation in photographing these dark interiors, but there was a sort of ledge like a seat by the side of each doorway, and so I lodged the camera on that to get a steady stand, and snapped off the flashlight from behind and above.  I got pictures of four of the chambers this way, and then came to one where the ledge was higher and wider.  I put down the camera, wedged it level with scraps of stone, and then sat down myself to recharge the flashlight machine.  But the moment my weight got on that ledge, there was a sharp crackle, and down I went half a dozen inches.  Of course I was up again pretty sharply, and snapped up the kodak just as it was going to slide off to the ground.  I will confess, too, I was feeling pleased.  Here at any rate was a Guanche cupboard of sorts, and as they had taken the trouble to hermetically seal it with cement, the odds were that it had something inside worth hiding.  At first there was nothing to be seen but a lot of dust and rubble, so I lit a bit of candle and cleared this away.  Presently, however, I began to find that I was shelling out something that was not cement.  It chipped away, in regular layers, and when I took it to the daylight I found that each layer was made up of two parts.  One side was shiny staff that looked like talc, and on this was smeared a coating of dark toffee- coloured material, that might have been wax.  The toffee-coloured surface was worked over with some kind of pattern.  Now I do not profess to any knowledge on these matters, and as a consequence took what Coppinger had told me about Guanche habits and acquirements as more or less true.  For instance, he had repeatedly impressed upon me that this old people could not write, and having this in my memory, I did not guess that the patterns scribed through the wax were letters in some obsolete character, which, if left to myself, probably I should have done.  But still at the same time I came to the conclusion that the stuff was worth looting, and so set to work quarrying it out with the heel of my boot and a pocket-knife.  The sheets were all more or less stuck together, and so I did not go in for separating them farther.  They fitted exactly to the cavity in which they were stored, but by smashing down its front I was able to get at the foot of them, and then I hacked away through the bottom layers with the knife till I got the bulk out in one solid piece.  It measured some twenty inches by fifteen, by fifteen, but it was not so heavy as it looked, and when I had taken the remaining photographs, I lowered it down to Coppinger on the end of the rope.  There was nothing more to do in the caves then, so I went down myself next.  The lump of sheets was on the ground, and Coppinger was on all fours beside it.  He was pretty nearly mad with excitement.   "What is it?" I asked him.  "I don't know yet.  But it is the most valuable find ever made in the Canary Islands, and it's yours, you unappreciative beggar; at least what there is left of it.  Oh, man, man, you've smashed up the beginning, and you've smashed up the end of some history that is probably priceless.  It's my own fault.  I ought to have known better than set an untrained man to do important exploring work."  "I should say it's your fault if anything's gone wrong.  You said there was no such thing as writing known to these ancient Canarios, and I took your word for it.  For anything I knew the stuff might have been something to eat."  "It isn't Guanche work at all," said he testily.  "You ought to have known that from the talc.  Great heavens, man, have you no eyes?  Haven't you seen the general formation of the island?  Don't you know there's no talc here?"  "I'm no geologist.  Is this imported literature then?"  "Of course.  It's Egyptian: that's obvious at a glance. Though how it's got here I can't tell yet.  It isn't stuff you can read off like a newspaper.  The character's a variant on any of those that have been discovered so far.  And as for this waxy stuff spread over the talc, it's unique.  It's some sort of a mineral, I think: perhaps asphalt.  It doesn't scratch up like animal wax.  I'll analyse that later.  Why they once invented it, and then let such a splendid notion drop out of use, is just a marvel.  I could stay gloating over this all day."  "Well," I said, "if it's all the same for you, I'd rather gloat over a meal.  It's a good ten miles hard going to the fonda, and I'm as hungry as a hawk already.  Look here, do you know it is four o'clock already?  It takes longer than you think climbing down to each of these caves, and then getting up again for the next."  Coppinger spread his coat on the ground, and wrapped the lump of sheets with tender care, but would not allow it to be tied with a rope for fear of breaking more of the edges.  He insisted on carrying it himself too, and did so for the larger part of the way to Santa Brigida, and it was only when he was within an ace of dropping himself with sheer tiredness that he condescended to let me take my turn.  He was tolerably ungracious about it too.  "I suppose you may as well carry the stuff," he snapped, "seeing that after all it's your own."  Personally, when we got to the fonda, I had as good a dinner as was procurable, and a bottle of that old Canary wine, and turned into bed after a final pipe.  Coppinger dined also, but I have reason to believe he did not sleep much.  At any rate I found him still poring over the find next morning, and looking very heavy- eyed, but brimming with enthusiasm.  "Do you know," he said, "that you've blundered upon the most valuable historical manuscript that the modern world has ever yet seen?  Of course, with your clumsy way of getting it out, you've done an infinity of damage.  For instance, those top sheets you shelled away and spoiled, contained probably an absolutely unique account of the ancient civilisation of Yucatan."  "Where's that, anyway?"  "In the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  It's all ruins to-day, but once it was a very prosperous colony of the Atlanteans."  "Never heard of them.  Oh yes, I have though.  They were the people Herodotus wrote about, didn't he?  But I thought they were mythical."  "They were very real, and so was Atlantis, the continent where they lived, which lay just north of the Canaries here."  "What's that crocodile sort of thing with wings drawn in the margin?"  "Some sort of beast that lived in those bygone days.  The pages are full of them.  That's a cave-tiger.  And that's some sort of colossal bat.  Thank goodness he had the sense to illustrate fully, the man who wrote this, or we should never have been able to reconstruct the tale, or at any rate we could not have understood half of it.  Whole species have died out since this was written, just as a whole continent has been swept away and three civilisations quenched.  The worst of it is, it was written by a highly-educated man who somewhat naturally writes a very bad fist.  I've hammered at it all the night through, and have only managed to make out a few sentences here and there"--he rubbed his hands appreciatively.  "It will take me a year's hard work to translate this properly."  "Every man to his taste.  I'm afraid my interest in the thing wouldn't last as long as that.  But how did it get there?  Did your ancient Egyptian come to Grand Canary for the good of his lungs, and write it because he felt dull up in that cave?"  "I made a mistake there.  The author was not an Egyptian.  It was the similarity of the inscribed character which misled me.  The book was written by one Deucalion, who seems to have been a priest or general--or perhaps both--and he was an Atlantean.  How it got there, I don't know yet.  Probably that was told in the last few pages, which a certain vandal smashed up with his pocketknife, in getting them away from the place where they were stowed."  "That's right, abuse me.  Deucalion you say?  There was a Deucalion in the Greek mythology.  He was one of the two who escaped from the Flood: their Noah, in fact."  "The swamping of the continent of Atlantis might very well correspond to the Flood."  "Is there a Pyrrha then?  She was Deucalion's wife."  "I haven't come across her yet.  But there's a Phorenice, who may be the same.  She seems to have been the reigning Empress, as far as I can make out at present."  I looked with interest at illustrations in the margin.  They were quite understandable, although the perspective was all wrong.  "Weird beasts they seem to have had knocking about the country in those days.  Whacking big size too, if one may judge.  By Jove, that'll be a cave-tiger trying to puff down a mammoth.  I shouldn't care to have lived in those days."  "Probably they had some way of fighting the creatures.  However, that will show itself as I get along with the translation."  He looked at his watch--"I suppose I ought to be ashamed of myself, but I haven't been to bed.  Are you going out?"  "I shall drive back to Las Palmas.  I promised a man to have a round at golf this afternoon."  "Very well, see you at dinner.  I hope they've sent back my dress shirts from the wash.  O, lord!  I am sleepy."  I left him going up to bed, and went outside and ordered a carriage to take me down, and there I may say we parted for a considerable time.  A cable was waiting for me in the hotel at Las Palmas to go home for business forthwith, and there was a Liverpool boat in the harbour which I just managed to catch as she was steaming out.  It was a close thing, and the boatmen made a small fortune out of my hurry.  Now Coppinger was only an hotel acquaintance, and as I was up to the eyes in work when I got back to England, I'm afraid I didn't think very much more about him at the time.  One doesn't with people one just meets casually abroad like that.  And it must have been at least a year later that I saw by a paragraph in one of the papers, that he had given the lump of sheets to the British Museum, and that the estimated worth of them was ten thousand pounds at the lowest valuation.  Well, this was a bit of revelation, and as he had so repeatedly impressed on me that the things were mine by right of discovery, I wrote rather a pointed note to him mentioning that he seemed to have been making rather free with my property.  Promptly came back a stilted letter beginning, "Doctor Coppinger regrets" and so on, and with it the English translation of the wax-upon-talc MSS.  He "quite admitted" my claim, and "trusted that the profits of publication would be a sufficient reimbursement for any damage received."  Now I had no idea that he would take me unpleasantly like this, and wrote back a pretty warm reply to that effect; but the only answer I got to this was through a firm of solicitors, who stated that all further communications with Dr. Coppinger must be made through them.  I will say here publicly that I regret the line he has taken over the matter; but as the affair has gone so far, I am disposed to follow out his proposition.  Accordingly the old history is here printed; the credit (and the responsibility) of the translation rests with Dr. Coppinger; and whatever revenue accrues from readers, goes to the finder of the original talc-upon-wax sheets, myself.  If there is a further alteration in this arrangement, it will be announced publicly at a later date.  But at present this appears to be most unlikely.    1.  MY RECALL   The public official reception was over.  The sentence had been read, the name of Phorenice, the Empress, adored, and the new Viceroy installed with all that vast and ponderous ceremonial which had gained its pomp and majesty from the ages.  Formally, I had delivered up the reins of my government; formally, Tatho had seated himself on the snake-throne, and had put over his neck the chain of gems which symbolised the supreme office; and then, whilst the drums and the trumpets made their proclamation of clamour, he had risen to his feet, for his first state progress round that gilded council chamber as Viceroy of the Province of Yucatan.  With folded arms and bended head, I followed him between the glittering lines of soldiers, and the brilliant throng of courtiers, and chiefs, and statesmen.  The roof-beams quivered to the cries of "Long Live Tatho!"  "Flourish the Empress!" which came forth as in duty bound, and the new ruler acknowledged the welcome with stately inclinations of the head.  In turn he went to the three lesser thrones of the lesser governors--in the East, the North, and the South, and received homage from each as the ritual was; and I, the man whom his coming had deposed, followed with the prescribed meekness in his train.  It was a hard task, but we who hold the higher offices learn to carry before the people a passionless face.  Once, twenty years before, these same fine obeisances had been made to me; now the Gods had seen fit to make fortune change.  But as I walked bent and humbly on behind the heels of Tatho, though etiquette forbade noisy salutations to myself, it could not inhibit kindly glances, and these came from every soldier, every courtier, and every chief who stood there in that gilded hall, and they fell upon me very gratefully.  It is not often the fallen meet such tender looks.  The form goes, handed down from immemorial custom, that on these great ceremonial days of changing a ruler, those of the people being present may bring forward petitions and requests; may make accusations against their retiring head with sure immunity from his vengeance; or may state their own private theories for the better government of the State in the future.  I think it may be pardoned to my vanity if I record that not a voice was raised against me, or against any of the items of my twenty years of rule.  Nor did any speak out for alterations in the future.  Yes, even though we made the circuit for the three prescribed times, all present showed their approval in generous silence.  Then, one behind the other, the new Viceroy and the old, we marched with formal step over golden tiles of that council hall beneath the pyramid, and the great officers of state left their stations and joined in our train; and at the farther wall we came to the door of those private chambers which an hour ago had been mine own.  Ah, well!  I had no home now in any of those wondrous cities of Yucatan, and I could not help feeling a bitterness, though in sooth I should have been thankful enough to return to the Continent of Atlantis with my head still in its proper station.  Tatho gave his formal summons of "Open ye to the Viceroy," which the ritual commands, and the slaves within sent the massive stone valves of the door gaping wide.  Tatho entered, I at his heels; the others halted, sending valedictions from the threshold; and the valves of the door clanged on the lock behind us.  We passed on to the chamber beyond, and then, when for the first time we were alone together, and the forced etiquette of courts was behind us, the new Viceroy turned with meekly folded arms, and bowed low before me.  "Deucalion," he said, "believe me that I have not sought this office.  It was thrust upon me.  Had I not accepted, my head would have paid forfeit, and another man--your enemy--would have been sent out as viceroy in your place.  The Empress does not permit that her will shall ever be questioned."  "My friend," I made answer, "my brother in all but blood, there is no man living in all Atlantis or her territories to whom I had liefer hand over my government.  For twenty years now have I ruled this country of Yucatan, and Mexico beyond, first under the old King, and then as minister to this new Empress.  I know my colony like a book.  I am intimate with all her wonderful cities, with their palaces, their pyramids, and their people.  I have hunted the beasts and the savages in the forests.  I have built roads, and made the rivers so that they will carry shipping.  I have fostered the arts and crafts like a merchant; I have discoursed, three times each day, the cult of the Gods with mine own lips.  Through evil years and through good have I ruled here, striving only for the prosperity of the land and the strengthening of Atlantis, and I have grown to love the peoples like a father.  To you I bequeath them, Tatho, with tender supplications for their interests."  "It is not I that can carry on Deucalion's work with Deucalion's power, but rest content, my friend, that I shall do my humble best to follow exactly on in your footsteps.  Believe me, I came out to this government with a thousand regrets, but I would have died sooner than take your place had I known how vigorously the supplanting would trouble you."  "We are alone here," I said, "away from the formalities of formal assemblies, and a man may give vent to his natural self without fear of tarnishing a ceremony.  Your coming was something of the suddenest.  Till an hour ago, when you demanded audience, I had thought to rule on longer; and even now I do not know for what cause I am deposed."  "The proclamation said: 'We relieve our well-beloved Deucalion of his present service, because we have great need of his powers at home in our kingdom of Atlantis.'"  "A mere formality."  Tatho looked uneasily round the hangings of the chamber, and drew me with him to its centre, and lowered his voice.  "I do not think so," he whispered.  "I believe she has need of you.  There are troublous times on hand, and Phorenice wants the ablest men in the kingdom ready to her call."  "You may speak openly," I said, "and without fear of eavesdroppers.  We are in the heart of the pyramid here, built in every way by a man's length of solid stone.  Myself, I oversaw the laying of every course.  And besides, here in Yucatan, we have not the niceties of your old world diplomacy, and do not listen, because we count it shame to do so."  Tatho shrugged his shoulders.  "I acted only according to mine education.  At home, a loose tongue makes a loose head, and there are those whose trade it is to carry tales.  Still, what I say is this: The throne shakes, and Phorenice sees the need of sturdy props.  So she has sent this proclamation."  "But why come to me?  It is twenty years since I sailed to this colony, and from that day I have not returned to Atlantis once.  I know little of the old country's politics.  What small parcel of news drifts out to us across the ocean, reads with slender interest here.  Yucatan is another world, my dear Tatho, as you in the course of your government will learn, with new interests, new people, new everything.  To us here, Atlantis is only a figment, a shadow, far away across the waters.  It is for this new world of Yucatan that I have striven through all these years."  "If Deucalion has small time to spare from his government for brooding over his fatherland, Atlantis, at least, has found leisure to admire the deeds of her brilliant son.  Why, sir, over yonder at home, your name carries magic with it.  When you and I were lads together, it was the custom in the colleges to teach that the men of the past were the greatest this world has ever seen; but to-day this teaching is changed.  It is Deucalion who is held up as the model and example.  Mothers name their sons Deucalion, as the most valuable birth-gift they can make.  Deucalion is a household word.  Indeed, there is only one name that is near to it in familiarity."  "You trouble me," I said, frowning.  "I have tried to do my duty for its own sake, and for the country's sake, not for the pattings and fondlings of the vulgar.  And besides, if there are names to be in every one's mouth, they should be the names of the Gods."  Tatho shrugged his shoulders.  "The Gods?  They occupy us very little these latter years.  With our modern science, we have grown past the tether of the older Gods, and no new one has appeared.  No, my Lord Deucalion, if it were merely the Gods who were your competitors on men's lips, your name would be a thousand times the better known."  "Of mere human names," I said, "the name of this new Empress should come first in Atlantis, our lord the old King being now dead."  "She certainly would have it so," replied Tatho, and there was something in his tone which made me see that more was meant behind the words.  I drew him to one of the marble seats, and bent myself familiarly towards him.  "I am speaking," I said, "not to the new Viceroy of Yucatan, but to my old friend Tatho, a member of the Priests' Clan, like myself, with whom I worked side by side in a score of the smaller home governments, in hamlets, in villages, in smaller towns, in greater towns, as we gained experience in war and knowledge in the art of ruling people, and so tediously won our promotion.  I am speaking in Tatho's private abode, that was mine own not two hours since, and I would have an answer with that plainness which we always then used to one another."  The new Viceroy sighed whimsically.  "I almost forget how to speak in plain words now," he said.  "We have grown so polished in these latter days, that mere bald truth would be hissed as indelicate.  But for the memory of those early years, when we expended as much law and thought over the ownership of a hay-byre as we should now over the fate of a rebellious city, I will try and speak plain to you even now, Deucalion.  Tell me, old friend, what is it?"  "What of this new Empress?"  He frowned.  "I might have guessed your subject," he said.   "Then speak upon it.  Tell me of all the changes that have been made.  What has this Phorenice done to make her throne unstable in Atlantis?"  Tatho frowned still.  "If I did not know you to be as honest as our Lord the Sun, your questions would carry mischief with them.  Phorenice has a short way with those who are daring enough to discuss her policies for other purpose than politely to praise them."  "You can leave me ignorant if you wish," I said with a touch of chill.  This Tatho seemed to be different from the Tatho I had known at home, Tatho my workmate, Tatho who had read with me in the College of Priests, who had run with me in many a furious charge, who had laboured with me so heavily that the peoples under us might prosper.  But he was quick enough to see my change of tone.  "You force me back to my old self," he said with a half smile, "though it is hard enough to forget the caution one has learned during the last twenty years, even when speaking with you.  Still, whatever may have happened to the rest of us, it is clear to see that you at least have not changed, and, old friend, I am ready to trust you with my life if you ask it.  In fact, you do ask me that very thing when you tell me to speak all I know of Phorenice."  I nodded.  This was more like the old times, when there was full confidence between us.  "The Gods will it now that I return to Atlantis," I said, "and what happens after that the Gods alone know.  But it would be of service to me if I could land on her shores with some knowledge of this Phorenice, for at present I am as ignorant concerning her as some savage from Europe or mid-Africa."  "What would you have me tell?"  "Tell all.  I know only that she, a woman, reigns, whereby the ancient law of the land, a man should rule; that she is not even of the Priestly Clan from which the law says all rulers must be drawn; and that, from what you say, she has caused the throne to totter.  The throne was as firm as the everlasting hills in the old King's day, Tatho."  "History has moved with pace since then, and Phorenice has spurred it.  You know her origin?"  "I know only the exact little I have told you."  "She was a swineherd's daughter from the mountains, though this is never even whispered now, as she has declared herself to be a daughter of the Gods, with a miraculous birth and upbringing.  As she has decreed it a sacrilege to question this parentage, and has ordered to be burnt all those that seem to recollect her more earthly origin, the fable passes current for truth.  You see the faith I put in you, Deucalion, by telling you what you wish to learn."  "There has always been trust between us."  "I know; but this habit of suspicion is hard to cast off, even with you.  However, let me put your good faith between me and the torture further.  Zaemon, you remember, was governor of the swineherd's province, and Zaemon's wife saw Phorenice and took her away to adopt and bring up as her own.  It is said that the swineherd and his woman objected; perhaps they did; anyway, I know they died; and Phorenice was taught the arts and graces, and brought up as a daughter of the Priestly Clan."  "But still she was an adopted daughter only," I objected.  "The omission of the 'adopted' was her will at an early age," said Tatho dryly, "and she learnt early to have her wishes carried into fact.  It was notorious that before she had grown to fifteen years she ruled not only the women of the household, but Zaemon also, and the province that was beyond Zaemon."  "Zaemon was learned," I said, "and a devout follower of the Gods, and searcher into the higher mysteries; but, as a ruler, he was always a flabby fellow."  "I do not say that opportunities have not come usefully in Phorenice's way, but she has genius as well.  For her to have raised herself at all from what she was, was remarkable.  Not one woman out of a thousand, placed as she was, would have grown to be aught higher than a mere wife of some sturdy countryman, who was sufficiently simple to care nothing for pedigree.  But look at Phorenice: it was her whim to take exercise as a man-at-arms and practise with all the utensils of war; and then, before any one quite knows how or why it happened, a rebellion had broken out in the province, and here was she, a slip of a girl, leading Zaemon's troops."  "Zaemon, when I knew him, was a mere derision in the field."  "Hear me on.  Phorenice put down the rebellion in masterly fashion, and gave the conquered a choice between sword and service.  They fell into her ranks at once, and were faithful to her from that moment.  I tell you, Deucalion, there is a marvellous fascination about the woman."  "Her present historian seems to have felt it."  "Of course I have.  Every one who sees her comes under her spell.  And frankly, I am in love with her also, and look upon my coming here as detestable exile.  Every one near to Phorenice, high and low, loves her just the same, even though they know it may be her whim to send them to execution next minute."  Perhaps I let my scorn of this appear.  "You feel contempt for our weakness?  You were always a strong man, Deucalion."  "At any rate you see me still unmarried.  I have found no time to palter with the fripperies of women."  "Ah, but these colonists here are crude and unfascinating.  Wait till you see the ladies of the court, my ascetic."  "It comes to my mind," I said dryly, "that I lived in Atlantis before I came out here, and at that time I used to see as much of court life as most men.  Yet then, also, I felt no inducement to marry."  Tatho chuckled.  "Atlantis has changed so that you would hardly know the country to-day.  A new era has come over everything, especially over the other sex.  Well do I remember the women of the old King's time, how monstrous uncomely they were, how little they knew how to walk or carry themselves, how painfully barbaric was their notion of dress.  I dare swear that your ladies here in Yucatan are not so provincial to-day as ours were then.  But you should see them now at home.  They are delicious.  And above all in charm is the Empress.  Oh, Deucalion, you shall see Phorenice in all her glorious beauty and her magnificence one of these fine days soon, and believe me you will go down on your knees and repent."  "I may see, and (because you say so) I may alter my life's ways.  The Gods make all things possible.  But for the present I remain as I am, celibate, and not wishful to be otherwise; and so in the meantime I would hear the continuance of your history."  "It is one long story of success.  She deposed Zaemon from his government in name as well as in fact, and the news was spread, and the Priestly Clan rose in its wrath.  The two neighbouring governors were bidden join forces, take her captive, and bring her for execution.  Poor men!  They tried to obey their orders; they attacked her surely enough, but in battle she could laugh at them.  She killed both, and made some slaughter amongst their troops; and to those that remained alive and became her prisoners, she made her usual offer--the sword or service.  Naturally they were not long over making their choice: to these common people one ruler is much the same as another: and so again her army was reinforced.  "Three times were bodies of soldiery sent against her, and three times was she victorious.  The last was a final effort.  Before, it had been customary to despise this adventuress who had sprung up so suddenly.  But then the priests began to realise their peril; to see that the throne itself was in danger; and to know that if she were to be crushed, they would have to put forth their utmost.  Every man who could carry arms was pressed into the service.  Every known art of war was ordered to be put into employment.  It was the largest army, and the best equipped army that Atlantis then had ever raised, and the Priestly Clan saw fit to put in supreme command their general, Tatho."  "You!" I cried.  "Even myself, Deucalion.  And mark you, I fought my utmost.  I was not her creature then; and when I set out (because they wanted to spur me to the uttermost) the High Council of the priests pointed out my prospects.  The King we had known so long, was ailing and wearily old; he was so wrapped up in the study of the mysteries, and the joy of closely knowing them, that earthly matters had grown nauseous to him; and at any time he might decide to die.  The Priestly Clan uses its own discretion in the election of a new king, but it takes note of popular sentiment; and a general who at the critical time could come home victorious from a great campaign, which moreover would release a harassed people from the constant application of arms, would be the idol of the moment.  These things were pointed out to me solemnly and in the full council."  "What!  They promised you the throne?"  "Even that.  So you see I set out with a high stake before me.  Phorenice I had never seen, and I swore to take her alive, and give her to be the sport of my soldiery.  I had a fine confidence in my own strategy then, Deucalion.  But the old Gods, in whom I trusted then, remained old, taught me no new thing.  I drilled and exercised my army according to the forms you and I learnt together, old comrade, and in many a tough fight found to serve well; I armed them with the choicest weapons we knew of then, with sling and mace, with bow and spear, with axe and knife, with sword and the throwing fire; their bodies I covered with metal plates; even their bellies I cared for, with droves of cattle driven in the rear of the fighting troops.  "But when the encounter came, they might have been men of straw for all the harm they did.  Out of her own brain Phorenice had made fire-tubes that cast a dart which would kill beyond two bowshots, and the fashion in which she handled her troops dazzled me.  They threatened us on one flank, they harassed us on the other.  It was not war as we had been accustomed to.  It was a newer and more deadly game, and I had to watch my splendid army eaten away as waves eat a sandhill.  Never once did I get a chance of forcing close action.  These new tactics that had come from Phorenice's invention, were beyond my art to meet or understand.  We were eight to her one, and our close-packed numbers only made us so much the more easy for slaughter.  A panic came, and those who could fled.  Myself, I had no wish to go back and earn the axe that waits for the unsuccessful general.  I tried to die there fighting where I stood.  But death would not come.  It was a fine melee, Deucalion, that last one."  "And so she took you?"  "I stood with three others back to back, with a ring of dead round us, and a ring of the enemy hemming us in. We taunted them to come on.  But at hand-to-hand courtesies we had shown we could hold our own, and so they were calling for fire-tubes with which they could strike us down in safety from a distance.  Then up came Phorenice.  'What is this to-do?' says she.  'We seek to kill Lord Tatho, who led against you,' say they.  'So that is Tatho?' says she.  'A fine figure of a man indeed, and a pretty fighter seemingly, after the old manner.  Doubtless he is one who would acquire the newer method.  See now Tatho,' says she, 'it is my custom to offer those I vanquish either the sword (which, believe me, was never nearer your neck than now) or service under my banner.  Will you make a choice?'  "'Woman,' I said, 'fairest that ever I saw, finest general the world has ever borne, you tempt me sorely by your qualities, but there is a tradition in our Clan, that we should be true to the salt we eat.  I am the King's man still, and so I can take no service from you.'  "'The King is dead,' says she.  'A runner has just brought the tidings, meaning them to have fallen into your hands.  And I am the Empress.'  "'Who made you Empress?' I asked.  "'The same most capable hand that has given me this battle,' says she.  'It is a capable hand, as you have seen: it can be a kind hand also, as you may learn if you choose.  With the King dead, Tatho is a masterless man now.  Is Tatho in want of a mistress?'  "'Such a glorious mistress as you,' I said, 'Yes.'  And from that moment, Deucalion, I have been her slave.  Oh, you may frown; you may get up from this seat and walk away if you will.  But I ask you this: keep back your worst judgment of me, old friend, till after you have seen Phorenice herself in the warm and lovely flesh.  Then your own ears and your own senses will be my advocates, to win me back your old esteem."    2. BACK TO ATLANTIS   The words of Tatho were no sleeping draught for me that night.  I began to think that I had made somewhat a mistake in wrapping myself up so entirely in my government of Yucatan, and not contriving to keep more in touch with events that were passing at home in Atlantis.  For many years past it had been easy to see that the mariner folk who did traffic across the seas spoke with restraint, and that only what news the Empress pleased was allowed to ooze out beyond her borders.  But, as I say, I was fully occupied with my work in the colony, and had no curiosity to pull away a veil intentionally placed.  Besides, it has always been against my principles to put to the torture men who had received orders for silence from their superiors, merely that they shall break these orders for my private convenience.  However, the iron discipline of our Priestly Clan left me no choice of procedure.  As was customary, I had been deprived of my office at a moment's notice.  From that time on, all papers and authority belonged to my successor, and, although by courtesy I might be permitted to remain as a guest in the pyramid that had so recently been mine, to see another sunrise, it was clearly enjoined that I must leave the territory then at the topmost of my speed and hasten to report in Atlantis.  Tatho, to give him credit, was anxious to further my interests to the utmost in his power.  He was by my side again before the dawn, putting all his resources at my disposal.  I had little enough to ask him.  "A ship to take me home," I said, "and I shall be your debtor."  The request seemed to surprise him.  "That you may certainly have if you wish it.  But my ships are foul with the long passage, and are in need of a careen.  If you take them, you will make a slow voyage of it to Atlantis.  Why do you not take your own navy?  The ships are in harbour now, for I saw them there when we came in.  Brave ships they are too."  "But not mine.  That navy belongs to Yucatan."  "Well, Deucalion, you are Yucatan; or, rather, you were yesterday, and have been these twenty years."  I saw what he meant, and the idea did not please me. I answered stiffly enough that the ships were owned by private merchants, or belonged to the State, and I could not claim so much as a ten-slave galley.  Tatho shrugged his shoulders.  "I suppose you know your own policies best," he said, "though to me it seems but risky for a man who has attained to a position like yours and mine not to have provided himself with a stout navy of his own.  One never knows when a recall may be sent, and, through lack of these precautions, a life's earnings may very well be lost in a dozen hours."  "I have no fear for mine," I said coldly.  "Of course not, because you know me to be your friend.  But had another man been appointed to this vice-royalty, you might have been sadly shorn, Deucalion.  It is not many fellows who can resist a snug hoard ready and waiting in the very coffers they have come to line."  "My Lord Tatho," I said, "it is clear to me that you and I have grown to be of different tastes.  All of the hoard that I have made for myself in this colony, few men would covet.  I have the poor clothes you see me in this moment, and a box of drugs such as I have found useful to the stomach.  I possess also three slaves, two of them scribes and the third a sturdy savage from Europe, who cooks my victual and fills for me the bath.  For my maintenance during my years of service, here, I have bled the State of a soldier's ration and nothing beyond; and if in my name any man has mulcted a creature in Yucatan of so much as an ounce of bronze, I request you as a last service to have that man hanged for me as a liar and a thief."  Tatho looked at me curiously.  "I do not know whether I admire you most or whether I pity.  I do not know whether to be astonished or to despise.  We had heard of much of your uprightness over yonder in Atlantis, of your sternness and your justice, but I swear by the old Gods that no soul guessed you carried your fancy so far as this.  Why, man, money is power.  With money and the resources money can buy, nothing could stop a fellow like you; whilst without it you may be tripped up and trodden down irrevocably at the first puny reverse."  "The Gods will choose my fate."  "Possibly; but for mine, I prefer to nourish it myself.  I tell you with frankness that I have not come here to follow in the pattern you have made for a vice-royalty.  I shall govern Yucatan wisely and well to the best of my ability; but I shall govern it also for the good of Tatho, the viceroy.  I have brought with me here my navy of eight ships and a personal bodyguard.  There is my wife also, and her women and her slaves.  All these must be provided for.  And why indeed should it be otherwise?  If a people is to be governed, it should be their privilege to pay handsomely for their prince."  "We shall not agree on this.  You have the power now, and can employ it as you choose.  If I thought it would be of any use, I should like to supplicate you most humbly to deal with lenience when you come to tax these people who are under you.  They have grown very dear to me."  "I have disgusted you with me, and I am grieved for it. But even to retain your good opinion, Deucalion--which I value more than that of any man living--I cannot do here as you have done.  It would be impossible, even if I wished it.  You must not judge all other men by your own strong standard: a Tatho is by no means a colossus like a Deucalion.  And besides, I have a wife and children, and they must be provided for, even if I neglect myself."  "Ah, there," I said, "it does seem that I possess the advantage.  I have no wife, to clog me."  He caught up my word quickly.  "It seems to me you have nothing that makes life worth living.  You have neither wife, children, riches, cooks, retinue, dresses, nor anything else in proportion to your station.  You will pardon my saying it, old comrade, but you are plaguey ignorant about some matters.  For example, you do not know how to dine.  During every day of a very weary voyage, I have promised myself when sitting before the meagre sea victual, that presently the abstinence would be more than repaid by Deucalion's welcoming feast.  Oh, I tell you that feast was one of the vividest things that ever came before my eyes.  And then when we get to the actuality, what was it?  Why, a country farmer every day sits down to more delicate fare.  You told me how it was prepared.  Well, your savage from Europe may be lusty, and perchance is faithful, but be is a devil-possessed cook.  Gods!  I have lived better on a campaign.  "I know this is a colony here, without any of the home refinements; but if in the days to come, the deer of the forest, the fish of the stream, and the other resources of the place are not put to better use than heretofore, I shall see it my duty as ruler to fry some of the kitchen staff alive in grease so as to encourage better cookery.  Gods!  Deucalion, have you forgotten what it is to have a palate?  And have you no esteem for your own dignity?  Man, look at your clothes.  You are garbed like a herdsman, and you have not a gaud or a jewel to brighten you."  "I eat," I said coldly, "when my hunger bids me, and I carry this one robe upon my person till it is worn out and needs replacement.  The grossness of excessive banqueting, and the effeminacy of many clothes are attainments that never met my fancy.  But I think we have talked here over long, and there seems little chance of our finding agreement.  You have changed, Tatho, with the years, and perhaps I have changed also.  These alterations creep imperceptibly into one's being as time advances.  Let us part now, and, forgetting these present differences, remember only our friendship of twenty years agone.  That for me, at any rate, has always had a pleasant savour when called up into the memory."  Tatho bowed his head.  "So be it," he said.  "And I would still charge myself upon your bounty for that ship.  Dawn cannot be far off now, and it is not decent that the man who has ruled here so long, should walk in daylight through the streets on the morning after his dismissal."  "So be it," said Tatho.  "You shall have my poor navy.  I could have wished that you had asked me something greater."  "Not the navy, Tatho; one small ship.  Believe me, more is wasted."  "Now, there," said Tatho, "I shall act the tyrant.  I am viceroy here now, and will have my way in this.  You may go naked of all possessions: that I cannot help.  But depart for Atlantis unattended, that you shall not."  And so, in fine, as the choice was set beyond me, it was in the "Bear," Tatho's own private ship, with all the rest of his navy sailing in escort, that I did finally make my transit.  But the start was not immediate.  The vessels lay moored against the stone quays of the inner harbour, gutted of their stores, and with crews exhausted, and it would have been suicide to have forced them out then and there to again take the seas.  So the courtesies were fulfilled by the craft whereon I abode hauling out into the entrance basin, and anchoring there in the swells of the fairway; and forthwith she and her consorts took in wood and water, cured meat and fish ashore, and refitted in all needful ways, with all speed attainable.  For myself there came then, as the first time during twenty busy years, a breathing space from work.  I had no further connection with the country of my labours; indeed, officially, I had left it already.  Into the working of the ship it was contrary to rule that I should make any inspection or interest, since all sea matters were the exclusive property of the Mariners' Guild, secured to them by royal patent, and most jealously guarded.  So there remained to me in my day, hours to gaze (if I would) upon the quays, the harbours, the palaces, and the pyramids of the splendid city before me which I had seen grow stone by stone from its foundations; or to roam my eye over the pastures and the grain lands beyond the walls, and to look longingly at the dense forests behind, from which field by field we had so tediously ripped our territory.  Would Tatho continue the work so healthily begun?  I trusted so, even in spite of his selfish words.  And at all hours, during the radiance of our Lord the Sun, or under the stars of night, I was free to pursue that study of the higher mysteries, on which we of the Priests' Clan are trained to set our minds, without aid of book or instrument, of image or temple.  The refitting of the navy was gone about with speed.  Never, it is said, had ships been reprovisioned and caulked, and remanned with greater speed for the over-ocean voyage.  Indeed, it was barely over a month from the day that they brought up in the harbour, they put out beyond the walls, and began their voyage eastward over the hills and dale of the ocean.  Rowing-slaves from Europe for this long passage of sea are not taken now, owing to the difficulty in provisioning them, for modern humanity forbids the practice of letting them eat one another according to the home custom of their continent; sails alone are but an indifferent stand by; but modern science has shown how to extract force from the Sun, when He is free from cloud, and this (in a manner kept secret by mariners) is made to draw sea-water at the forepart of the vessel, and eject it with such force at the stern that she is appreciably driven forward, even with the wind adverse.  In another matter also has navigation vastly improved.  It is not necessary now, as formerly, to trust wholly to a starry night (when beyond sight of land) to find direction.  A little image has been made, and is stood balanced in the forepart of every vessel, with an arm outstretched, pointing constantly to the direction where the Southern Cross lies in the Heavens.  So, by setting an angle, can a just course be correctly steered.  Other instruments have they also for finding a true position on the ocean wastes, for the newer mariner, when he is at sea, puts little trust in the Gods, and confides mightily in his own thews and wits.  Still, it is amusing to see these tarry fellows, even in this modern day, take their last farewell of the harbour town.  The ship is stowed, and all ready for sea, and they wash and put on all their bravery of attire.  Ashore they go, their faces long with piety, and seek some obscure temple whose God has little flavour with shore folk, and here they make sacrifice with clamour and lavish outlay.  And, finally, there follows a feast in honour of the God, and they arrive back on board, and put to sea for the most part drunken, and all heavy and evil-humoured with gluttony and their other excesses.  The voyage was very different to my previous sea-going.  There was no creeping timorously along in touch with the coasts.  We stood straight across the open gulf in the direction of home, came up with the band of the Carib Islands, and worked confidently through them, as though they had been signposts to mark the sea highway; and stopped only twice to replenish with wood, water, and fruit.  These commodities, too, the savages brought us freely, so great was their subjection, and in neither place did we have even the semblance of a fight.  It was a great certificate of the growing power of Atlantis and her finest over-sea colony.  Then boldly on we went across the vast ocean beyond, with never a sacrifice to implore the Gods that they should help our direction.  One might feel censure towards these rugged mariners for their impiety, but one could not help an admiration for their lusty skill and confidence.  The dangers of the desolate sea are dealt out as the Gods will, and man can only take them as they come.  Storms we encountered, and the mariners fought them with stubborn endurance; twice a blazing stone from Heaven hissed into the sea beside us, though without injuring any of our ships; and, as was unavoidable, the great beasts of the sea hunted us with their accustomed savagery.  But only once did we suffer material loss from these last, and that was when three of the greater sea lizards attacked the "Bear," the ship whereon I travelled, at one and the same time.  The hour of their onset was during the blazing midday heat, and the Sun being at the full of His power, our machines were getting full force from Him.  The vessel was travelling forward faster than a man on dry land could walk.  But for the power escape she might as well have been standing still when the beasts sighted her.  There were three of them, as I have said, and we saw them come up over the curve of the horizon, beating the sea into foam with their flappers, and waving their great necks like masts as they swam.  Our navy was spread out in a long line of ships, and in olden days each of the beasts would have selected a separate prey, and proceeded for it; but, like man, these beasts have learned the necessities of warfare, and they hunt in pack now and do not separate their forces.  It was plain they were making for our ship, and Tob, the captain, would have had me go into the after-castle, and there be secure from their marauding.  He was responsible to the Lord Tatho, he said, for my safe conduct; it was certain that the beasts would contrive to seize some of the ship's company before they were satiated; and if the hap came to the Lord Deucalion, he (the captain) would have to give himself voluntarily to the beasts then, to escape a very painful death at Tatho's hands later on.  However, my mind was set.  A man can never have too much experience in fighting enemies, whether human or bestial, and the attack of these creatures was new to me, and I was fain to learn its method.  So I gave the captain a letter to Tatho, saying how the matter lay (and for which, it may be mentioned, the rude fellow seemed little enough grateful), and stayed in my chair under the awning.  The beasts surged up to us with champing jaws, and all the shipmen stood armed on their defence.  They came up alongside, two females (the smaller) on the flank of the ship, the giant male by himself on the other.  Their great heads swooped about, as high as the yards that held the sails, and the reek from them gave one physical sickness.  The shipmen faced the monsters with a sturdy courage.  Arrows were useless against the smooth, bull-like hides.  Even the throwing fire could not so much as singe them; nothing but twenty axe blows delivered on an attacking head together could beat it back, and even these succeeded only through sheer weight of metal, and did not make so much as the scratch of a wound.  During all time beasts have disputed with man the mastery of the earth, and it is only in Atlantis and Egypt and Yucatan that man has dared to hold his own, and fight them with a mind made strong by many previous victories.  In Europe and mid-Africa the greater beasts hold full dominion, and man admits his puny number and force, and lives in earth crannies and the higher tree-tops, as a fugitive confessed.  And upon the great oceans, the beasts are lords, unchecked.  Still here, upon this desolate sea, although the giant lizards were new to me, it was a pleasure to pit my knowledge of war against their brute strength and courage.  Ever since the first men did their business upon the great waters, they fulfilled their instincts in fighting the beasts with desperation.  Hiding coward-like in a hold was useless, for if this enemy could not find men above decks to glut them, they would break a ship with their paddles, and so all would be slain.  And so it was recognised that the fight should go forward as desperately as might be, and that it could only end when the beasts had got their prey and had gone away satisfied.  It was in a one-sided conflict after this fashion then, that I found myself, and felt the joy once more to have my thews in action.  But after my axe had got in some dozen lusty blows, which, for all the harm they did, might have been delivered against some city wall, or, indeed, against the ark of the Mysteries itself, I sought about me till I found a lance, and with that made very different play.  The eyes of these lizards are small, and set deep in a bony socket, but I judged them to be vulnerable, and it was upon the eyes of the beast that I made my attack.  The decks were slippery with the horrid slime of them.  The crew surged about in their battling, and, moreover, constantly offered themselves as a rampart before me by reason of Tob, the captain's threats.  But I gave a few shrewd progues with the lance to show that I did not choose my will to be overridden, and presently was given room for manoeuvre.  Deliberately I placed myself in the sight of one of the lizards, and offered my body to its attack.  The challenge was accepted.  It swooped like a dropping stone, and I swerved and drove in the lance at its oozy eye.  I thanked the Gods then that I had been trained with the lance till certain aim was a matter of instinct with me. The blade went true to its mark and stuck there, and the shaft broke in my hand.  The beast drew off, blinded and bellowing, and beating the sea with its paddles.  In a great cataract of foam I saw it bend its great long neck, and rub its head (with the spear still fixed) against its back, thereby enduring new agonies, but without dislodging the weapon.  And then presently, finding this of no avail, it set off for the place from which it came with extraordinary quickness, and rapidly grew smaller against the horizon.  The male and the other female lizard had also left us, but not in similar plight.  Tob, the captain, seeing my resolve to take hazards, deliberately thrust a shipman into the jaws of each of the others, so that they might be sated and get them gone.  It was clear that Tob dreaded very much for his own skin if I came by harm, and I thought with a warming heart of the threats that Tatho must have used in his kind anxiety for my safety.  It is pleasant when one's old friends do not omit to pay these little attentions.    3. A RIVAL NAVY   Now, when we came up with the coasts of Atlantis, though Tob, with the aid of his modern instruments, had made his landfall with most marvellous skill and nearness, there still remained some ten days' more journey in which we had to retrace our course, till we came to that arm of the sea up which lies the great city of Atlantis, the capital.  The sight of the land, and the breath of earth and herbage which came off from it with the breezes, were, I believe, under the Gods, the means of saving the lives of all of us.  For, as is necessary with long cross-ocean voyages, many of our ships' companies had died, and still more were sick with scurvy through the unnatural tossing, or (as some have it) through the salt, unnatural food inseparable from shipboard.  But these last, the sight and the smells of land heartened up in extraordinary fashion, and from being helpless logs, unable to move even under blows of the scourge, they became active again, able to help in the shipwork, and lusty (when the time came) to fight for their lives and their vessels.  From the moment that I was deposed in Yucatan, despite Tatho's assurances, there had been doubts in my mind as to what nature would be my reception in Atlantis.  But I had faced this event of the future without concern: it was in the hands of the Gods.  The Empress Phorenice might be supreme on earth; she might cause my head to be lopped from its proper shoulders the moment I set foot ashore; but my Lord the Sun was above Phorenice, and if my head fell, it would be because He saw best that it should be so.  On which account, therefore, I had not troubled myself about the matter during the voyage, but had followed out my calm study of the higher mysteries with an unloaded mind.  But when our navy had retraced sufficiently the course that had been overrun, and came up with the two vast headlands which marked the entrance to the inland waters, there, a bare two days from the Atlantis capital, we met with another navy which was, beyond doubt, waiting to give us a reception.  The ships were riding at anchor in a bay which lent them shelter, but they had scouts on the high land above, who cried the alarm of our approach, and when we rounded the headland, they were standing out to dispute our passage.  Of us there were now but five ships, the rest having been lost in storms, or fallen behind because all their crews were dead from the scurvy; and of the strangers there were three fine ships, and three galleys of many oars apiece.  They were clean and bright and black; our ships were storm-ragged and weather-worn, and had bottoms that were foul with trailing ocean weed.  Our ships hung out the colours and signs of Tatho and Deucalion openly and without shame, so that all who looked might know their origin and errand; but the other navy came on without banner or antient, as though they were some low creatures feeling shame for their birth.  Clear it seemed also that they would not let us pass without a fight, and in this there was nothing uncommon; for no law carries out over the seas, and a brother in one ship feels quite free to harry his brother in another vessel if he meets him out of earshot of the beach--more especially if that other brother be coming home laden from foray or trading tour.  So Tob, with system and method, got our vessel into fighting trim, and the other four captains did the like with theirs, and drew close in to us to form a compact squadron.  They had no wish to smell slavery, now that the voyage had come so near to its end.  Our Lord the Sun shone brilliantly, giving full speed to the machines, as though He was fully willing for the affair to proceed, and the two navies approached one another with quickness, the three galleys holding back to stay in line with their consorts.  But when some bare hundred ship-lengths separated us, the other navy halted, and one of the galleys, drawing ahead, flew green branches from her masts, seeking for a parley.  The course was unusual, but we, in our sea-battered state, were no navy to invite a fight unnecessarily.  So in hoarse sea-bawls word was passed, and we too halted, and Tob hoisted a withered stick (which had to do duty for greenery), to show that we were ready for talk, and would respect the person of an ambassador.  The galley drew on, swung round, and backed till its stern rasped on our shield rail, and one of her people clambered up and jumped down upon our decks.  He was a dandily rigged-out fellow, young and lusty, and all healthy from the land and land victual, and he looked round him with a sneer at our sea-tatteredness, and with a fine self-confidence.  Then, seeing Tob, he nodded as one meets an acquaintance.  "Old pot-mate," he said, "your woman waits for you up by the quay-side in Atlantis yonder, with four youngsters at her heels.  I saw her not half a month ago."  "You didn't come out here to tell me home news," said Tob; "that I'll be sworn.  I've drunk enough pots with you, Dason, to know your pleasantries thoroughly."  "I wanted to point out to you that your home is still there, with your wife and children ready to welcome you."  "I am not a man that ever forgets it," said Tob grimly; "and because I've got them always at the back of my mind, I've sailed this ship over the top of more than one pirate, when, if I'd been a single man, I might have been e'en content to take the hap of slavery."  "Oh, I know you're a desperate enough fellow," said Dason, "and I'm free to confess that if it does come to blows we are like to lose a few men before we get you and your cripples here, and your crazy ships comfortably sunk.  Our navy has its orders to carry out, and the cause of my embassage is this: we wish to see if you will act the sensible part and give us what we want, and so be permitted to go on your way home, with a skin that is unslit and dry?"  "You have come to the wrong bird here for a plucking," said Tob with a heavy laugh.  "We took no treasure or merchandise on board in Yucatan.  We stayed in harbour long enough to cure our sea victual and fill with food and water, and no longer.  We sail back as we sailed out, barren ships.  You will not believe me, of course; I would not have believed you had our places been changed; but you may go into the holds and search if you choose.  You will find there nothing but a few poor sailormen half in pieces with the scurvy.  No, you can steal nothing here but blows, Dason, and we will give you those with but little asking."  "I am glad to see that you state your cargo at such slender value," said the envoy, "for it is the cargo I must take back with me on the galley, if you are to earn your safe conduct to home."  Tob knit his brows.  "You had better speak more plain," he said.  "I am a common sailor, and do not understand fancy talk."  "It is clear to see," said Dason, "that you have been set to bring Deucalion back to Atlantis as a prop for Phorenice.  Well, we others find Phorenice hard enough to fight against without further reinforcements, and so we want Deucalion in our own custody to deal with after our own fashion."   "And if I do the miser, and deny you this piece of my freight?"  The spruce envoy looked round at the splintered ship, and the battered navy beside her.  "Why, then, Tob, we shall send you all to the fishes in very short time, and instead of Deucalion standing before the Gods alone, he will go down with a fine ragged company limping at his heels."  "I doubt it," said Tob, "but we shall see.  As for letting you have my Lord Deucalion, that is out of the question.  For see here, pot-mate Dason; in the first place, if I went to Atlantis without Deucalion, my other lord, Tatho, would come back one of these days, and in his hands I should die by the slowest of slow inches; in the second, I have seen my Lord Deucalion kill a great sea lizard, and he showed himself such a proper man that day that I would not give him up against his will, even to Tatho himself; and in the third place, you owe me for your share in our last wine-bout ashore, and I'll see you with the nether Gods before I give you aught till you've settled that score."  "Well, Tob, I hope you'll drown easy.  As for that wife of yours, I've always had a fancy for her myself, and I shall know how to find a use for the woman."  "I'll draw your neck for that, you son of a European," said Tob; "and if you do not clear off this deck I'll draw it here.  Go," he cried, "you father of monkey children!  Get away, and let me fight you fairly, or by my honour I'll stamp the inwards out of you, and make your silly crew wear them as necklaces."  Upon which Dason went to his galley.  Promptly Tob set going the machine on our own "Bear," and bawled his orders right and left to the other ships.  The crew might be weak with scurvy, but they were quick to obey.  Instantly the five vessels were all started, and because our Lord the Sun was shining brightly, got soon to the full of their pace.  The whole of our small navy converged, singling out one ship of their opponents, and she, not being ready for so swift an attack, got flurried, and endeavoured to turn and run for room, instead of trying to meet us bows on.  As a consequence, the whole of our five ships hit her together on the broadside, tearing her planking with their underwater beaks, and sinking her before we had backed clear from the engage.  But if we thus brought the enemy's number down to five, and so equal to our own, the advantage did not remain with us for long.  The three nimble galleys formed into line: their boatswains' whips cracked as the slaves bent to their oars, and presently one of our own ships was gored and sunk, the men on her being killed in the water without hope of rescue.  And then commenced a tight-locked melee that would have warmed the heart of the greatest warrior alive.  The ships and the galleys were forced together and lay savagely grinding one another upon the swells, as though they had been sentient animals.  The men on board them shot their arrows, slashed with axes, thrust and hacked with swords, and hurled the throwing fire.  But in every way the fight converged upon the "Bear."  It was on her that the enemy spent the fiercest of their spite; it was to the "Bear," that the other crews of Tatho's navy rallied as their own vessels caught fire, or were sunk or taken.  Battle is an old acquaintance with us of the Priestly Clan, and for those of us who have had to carve out territories for the new colonies, it comes with enough frequency to cloy even the most chivalrous appetite.  So I can speak here as a man of experience.  Up till that time, for half a life-span, I had heard men shout "Deucalion" as a battlecry, and in my day had seen some lusty encounters.  But this sea-fight surprised even me in its savage fierceness.  The bleak, unstable element which surrounded us; the swaying decks on which we fought; the throwing fire, which burnt flesh and wood alike with its horrid flame; the great gluttonous man-eating birds that hovered in the sky overhead; the man-eating fish that swarmed up from the seas around, gnawing and quarrelling over those that fell into the waters, all went to make up a circumstance fit to daunt the bravest men-at-arms ever gathered for an army.  But these tarry shipmen faced it all with an indomitable courage, and never a cry of quailing.  Life on the seas is so hard, and (from the beasts that haunt the great waters) so full of savage dangers, that Death has lost half his terrors to them through sheer familiarity.  They were fellows who from pure lust for a fray would fight to a finish amongst themselves in the taverns ashore; and so here, in this desperate sea-battle, the passion for killing burned in them, as a fire stone from Heaven rages in a forest; and they took even their death-wounds laughing.  On our side the battle-cry was "Tob!" and the name of this obscure ship-captain seemed to carry a confidence with it for our own crews that many a well-known commander might have envied.  The enemy had a dozen rallying cries, and these confused them.  But as their other ship-commanders one by one were killed, and Dason remained, active with mischief, "Dason!" became the shout which was thrown back at us in response to our "Tob!"  However, I will not load my page with farther long account of this obscure sea-fight, whose only glory was its ferocity.  One by one all the ships of either side were sunk or lay with all their people killed, till finally only Dason's galley and our own "Bear" were left.  For the moment we were being mastered.  We had a score of men remaining out of all those that manned the navy when it sailed from Yucatan, and the enemy had boarded us and made the decks of the "Bear" the field of battle.  But they had been over busy with the throwing fire, and presently, as we raged at one another, the smoke and the flame from the sturdy vessel herself let us very plainly know that she was past salvation.  But Tob was nothing daunted.  "They may stay here and fry if they choose," he shouted with his great boisterous laugh, "but for ourselves the galley is good enough now.  Keep a guard on Deucalion, and come with me, shipmates!"  "Tob!" our fellows shouted in their ecstasy of fighting madness, and I too could not forbear sending out a "Tob!" for my battle-cry.  It was a change for me not to be leader, but it was a luxury for once to fight in the wake of this Tob, despite his uncouthness of mien and plan.  There was no stopping this new rush, though progress still was slow.  Tob with his bloody axe cut the road in front, and we others, with the lust of battle filling us to the chin, raged like furies in his wake.  Gods! but it was a fight.  Ten of us won to the galley, with the flames and the smoke from the poor "Bear" spurting at our heels.  We turned and stabbed madly at all who tried to follow, and hacked through the grapples that held the vessels to their embrace.  The sea-swells spurned the "Bear" away.  The slaves chained to the rowing-galley's benches had interest neither one way nor the other, and looked on the contest with dull concern, save when some stray missile found a billet amongst them.  But a handful of the fighting men had scrambled desperately on board the galley after us, preferring any fate to a fiery death on the "Bear," and these had to be dealt with promptly.  Three, with their fighting fury still red-hot in them, had most wastefully to be killed out of mischief's way; five, who had pitched their weapons into the sea, were chained to oar looms, in place of slaves who were dead; and there remained only Dason to have a fate apportioned.  The fight had cooled out of him, and he had thrown his arms to the sea, and stood sullenly ready for what might befall; and to him Tob went up with an exulting face.  "Ho, pot-mate Dason," cried he, "you made a lot of talk an hour ago about that woman of mine, who lives with her brats on the quay-side in Atlantis yonder.  Now, I'll give you a pleasant choice; either I'll take you along home, and tell her what you said before the whole ship's company (that are for the most part dead now, poor souls!), and I'll leave her to perform on your carcase as she sees fit by way of payment; or, as the other choice, I'll deal with you here now myself."  "I thank you for the chance," said Dason, and knelt and offered his neck to the axe.  So Tob cut off his head, sticking it on the galley's beak as an advertisement of what had been done.  The body he threw over the side, and one of the great man-eating birds that hovered near, picked it up and flew away with it to its nest amongst the crags.  And so we were free to get a meal of the fruits and the fresh meats which the galley offered, whilst the oar-slaves sent the galley rushing onwards towards the capital.  There was a wine-skin in the after-castle, and I filled a horn and poured some out at Tob's feet in salutation.  "My man," I said, "you have shown me a fight."  "Thanks," said he, "and I know you are a judge.  'Twas pretty whilst it lasted; and, seeing that my lads were, for the most, scurvy-rotten, I will say they fought with credit.  I have lost my Lord Tatho's navy, but I think Phorenice will see me righted there.  If those that are against her took so much trouble to kill my Lord Deucalion before he could come to her aid, I can fancy she will not be niggard in her joy when I put Deucalion safe, if somewhat dented and blood-bespattered, on the quay."  "The Gods know," I said, for it is never my custom to discuss policies with my inferiors, even though etiquette be for the moment loosened, as ours was then by the thrill of battle.  "The Gods will decide what is best for you, Tob, even as they have decided that it is best that I should go on to Atlantis."  The sailor held a horn filled from the wine-skin in his hand, and I think was minded to pour a libation at my feet, even as I had done at his.  But he changed his mind, and emptied it down his throat instead.  "It is thirsty work, this fighting," he said, "and that drink comes very useful."  I put my hand on his blood-smeared arm.  "Tob," I said, "whether I step into power again, or whether I go to the block to-morrow, is another matter which the Gods alone know, but hear me tell you now, that if a chance is given me of showing my gratitude, I shall not forget the way you have served me in this voyage, and the way you have fought this day."  Tob filled another brimming horn from the wine-skin and splashed it at my feet.  "That's good enough surety for me," he said, "that my woman and brats never want from this day onward.  The Lord Deucalion for the block, indeed!"    4. THE WELCOME OF PHORENICE   Now I can say it with all truth that, till the rival navy met us in the mouth of the gulf, I had thought little enough of my importance as a recruit for the Empress.  But the laying in wait for us of those ships, and the wild ferocity with which they fought so that I might fall into their hands, were omens which the blindest could not fail to read.  It was clear that I was expected to play a lusty part in the fortunes of the nation.  But if our coming had been watched for by enemies it seemed that Phorenice also had her scouts; and these saw us from the mountains, and carried news to the capital.  The arm of the sea at the head of which the vast city of Atlantis stands, varies greatly in width.  In places where the mountains have over-boiled, and sent their liquid contents down to form hard stone below, the channel has barely a river's wideness, and then beyond, for the next half-day's sail it will widen out into a lake, with the sides barely visible.  Moreover, its course is winding, and so a runner who knows his way across the flats, and the swamps, and between the smoking hills which lie along the shore, and did not get overcome by fire-streams, or water, or wandering beasts, could carry news overland from seacoast to capital far speedier than even the most shrewdly whipped of galleys could ferry it along the water.  Of course there were heavy risks that a lone traveller would not make a safe passage by this land route, if he were bidden to sacrifice all precautions to speed.  But Phorenice was no niggard with her couriers.  She sent a corps of twenty to the headland that overlooks the sea-entrance to the straits; they started with the news, each on his own route; and it says much for their speed and cleverness, that no fewer than seven of these agile fellows came through scathless with their tidings, and of the others it was said that quite three were known to have survived.  Still, about this we had no means of knowing at the time, and pushed on in fancy that our coming was quite unheralded.  The slaves on the galley's row-banks were for the most part savages from Europe, and the smell of them was so offensive that the voyage lost all its pleasures; and as, moreover, the wind carried with it an infinite abundance of small grit from some erupting fire mountain, we were anxious to linger as little as possible.  Besides, if I may confess to such a thing without being unduly degraded, although by my priestly training I had been taught stoicism, and knew that all the future was in the hands of the Gods, I was frailly human still to have a very vast curiosity as to what would be the form of my own reception at Atlantis.  I could imagine myself taken a formal prisoner on landing, and set on a formal trial to answer for my cure of the colony of Yucatan; I could imagine myself stepping ashore unknown and unnoticed, and after a due lapse, being sent for by the Empress to take up new duties; but the manner of my real welcome was a thing I did not even guess at.  We came in sight of the peak of the sacred mountain, with its glare of eternal fires which stand behind the city, one morning with the day's break, and the whips of the boatswains cracked more vehemently, so that those offensive slaves should give the galley a final spurt.  The wind was adverse, and no sail could be spread, but under oars alone we made a pretty pace, and the sides of the sacred mountain grew longer, and presently the peaks of the pyramids in the city, the towers of the higher buildings, began to show themselves as though they floated upon the gleaming water.  It was twenty years since I had seen Atlantis last, and my heart glowed with the thought of treading again upon her paving-stones.  The splendid city grew out of the sea as we approached, and to every throb of the oars, the shores leaped nearer.  I saw the temple where I had been admitted first to manhood; I saw the pyramid in whose heart I had been initiated to the small mysteries; and then (as the lesser objects became discernible) I made out the house where a father and a mother had reared me, and my eyes became dim as the memories rose.  We drew up outside the white walls of the harbour, as the law was, and the slaves panted and sobbed in quietude over the oar-looms.  For vessels thus stationed there is, generally, a sufficiency of waiting, for a port-captain is apt to be so uncertain of his own dignity, that he must e'en keep folks waiting to prove it to them.  But here for us it might have been that the port-captain's boat was waiting.  The signal was sounded from the two castles at the harbour's entrance, the chain which hung between them was dropped, and a ten-oared boat shot out from behind the walls as fast as oars could drive her.  She raced up alongside and the questions were put:  "That should be Dason's galley?"  "It was," said Tob.  "Oh, I saw Dason's head on your beak," said the port-captain.  "You were Tatho's captain?"  "And am still.  Tatho's fleet was sent by Dason and his friends to the sea-floor, and so we took this stinking galley to finish the voyage in, seeing that it was the only craft left afloat."  The port-captain was roving his eye over the group of us who stood on the after-deck.  "I fear me, captain, that you'll have but a dangerous reception.  I do not see my Lord Deucalion.  Or does he come with some other navy?  Gods, captain, if you have let him get killed whilst under your charge, the Empress will have the skin torn slowly off you living."  "What with Phorenice and Tatho both so curious for his welfare," said Tob, "my Lord Deucalion seems but a dangerous passenger.  But I shall save my hide this voyage."  He jerked at me with his thumb.  "He's there to put in a word for me himself."  The port-captain stared for a moment, as if unbelieving, and then, as though satisfied, made obeisance like a fellow well used to ceremonial.  "I trust my lord, in his infinite strength, will pardon my sin in not knowing him by his nobleness before.  But truth to tell, I had looked to see my lord more suitably apparelled."  "Pish," I said; "if I choose to dress simply, I cannot object to being mistaken for a simple man.  It is not my pleasure to advertise my quality by the gauds on my garb.  If you think amends are due to me, I pray of your charity that this inquisition may end."  The fellow was all bows and obsequiousness.  "I am the humblest of my lord's servants," he said.  "It will be my exceeding honour to pilot my lord's galley into the berth appointed in harbour."  The boat shot ahead, and our galley-slaves swung into stroke again.  Tob watched me with a dry smile as he stood directing the men at the helms.  "Well," I said, humouring his whim, "what is it?"  "I'm thinking," said Tob, "that my Lord Deucalion will remember me only as a very rude fellow when he steps ashore amongst all this fine gentility."  "You don't think," said I, "anything of the kind."  "Then I must prove my refinement," said Tob, "and not contradict."  He picked up my hand in his huge, hard fist, and pressed it.  "By the Gods, Deucalion, you may be a great prince, but I've only known you as a man.  You're the finest fighter of beasts and men that walks this world to-day, and I love you for it.  That spear-stroke of yours on the lizard is a thing the singers in the taverns shall make chaunts about."  We drew rapidly into the harbour, the soldiers in the entrance castle blowing their trumpets in welcome as we passed between them.  The captain of the port had run up my banner to the masthead of his boat, having been provided with one apparently for this purpose of announcement, and from the quays, across the vast basin of the harbour, there presently came to us the noises of musicians, and the pale glow of welcoming fires, dancing under the sunlight.  I was almost awed to think that an Empress of Atlantis had come to such straits as to feel an interest like this in any mere returning subject.  It was clear that nothing was to be done by halves.  The port-captain's boat led, and we had no choice but to follow.  Our galley was run up alongside the royal quay and moored to its posts and rings of gold, all of which are sacred to the reigning house.  "If Dason could only have foreseen this honour," said Tob, with grisly jest, "I'm sure he'd have laid in a silken warp to make fast on the bollards instead of mere plebeian hemp.  I'm sure there'd be a frown on Dason's head this minute, if the sun hadn't scorched it stiff.  My Lord Deucalion, will you pick your way with niceness over this common ship and tread on the genteel carpet they've spread for you on the quay yonder?"  The port-captain heard Tob's rude banter and looked up with a face of horror, and I remembered, with a small sigh, that colonial freedom would have no place here in Atlantis.  Once more I must prepare myself for all the dignity of rank, and make ready to tread the formalities of vast and gorgeous ceremonial.  But, be these things how they may, a self-respecting man must preserve his individuality also, and though I consented to enter a pavilion of crimson cloth, specially erected to shelter me till the Empress should deign to arrive, there my complaisance ended.  Again the matter of clothes was harped upon.  The three gorgeously caparisoned chamberlains, who had inducted me to the shelter, laid before me changes of raiment bedecked with every imaginable kind of frippery, and would have me transform myself into a popinjay in fashion like their own.  Curtly enough, I refused to alter my garb, and when one of them stammeringly referred to the Empress's tastes I asked him with plainness if he had got any definite commands on this paltry matter from her mightiness.  Of course, he had to confess that there were none.  Upon which I retorted that Phorenice had commanded Deucalion, the man, to attend before her, and had sent no word of her pleasure as to his outer casing.  "This dress," I said, "suits my temper well.  It shields my poor body from the heat and the wind, and, moreover, it is clean.  It seems to me, sirs," I added, "that your interfering savours somewhat of an impertinence."  With one accord the chamberlains drew their swords and pushed the hilts towards me.  "It would be a favour," said their spokesman, "if the great Lord Deucalion would take his vengeance now, instead of delivering us to the tormentors hereafter."  "Poof," I said, "the matter is forgotten.  You make too much of a little."  Nevertheless, their action gave me some enlightenment.  They were perfectly in earnest in offering me the swords, and I recognised that this was a different Atlantis that I had come home to, where a man had dread of the torture for a mere difference concerning the cut of a coat.  There was a bath in the pavilion, and in that I regaled myself gladly, though there was some paltry scent added to the water that took away half its refreshing power; and then I set myself to wait with all outward composure and placidity.  The chamberlains were too well-bred to break into my calm, and I did not condescend to small talk.  So there we remained, the four of us, I sitting, they standing, with our Lord the Sun smiting heavily on the scarlet roof of the pavilion, whilst the music blared, and the welcoming fires dispersed their odours from the great paved square without, which faced upon the quay.  It has been said that the great should always collect dignity by keeping those of lesser degree waiting their pleasure, though for myself I must say I have always thought the stratagem paltry and beneath me.  Phorenice also seemed of this opinion, for (as she herself told me later) at the moment that Tob's galley was reported as having its flank against the marble of the royal quay, at that precise moment did she start out from the palace.  The gorgeous procession was already marshalled, bedecked, and waiting only for its chiefest ornament, and as soon as she had mounted to her steed, trumpets gave the order, and the advance began.  Sitting in the doorway of the pavilion, I saw the soldiery who formed the head of this vast concourse emerge from the great broad street where it left the houses.  They marched straight across to give me the salute, and then ranged themselves on the farther side of the square.  Then came the Mariners' Guild, then more soldiers, all making obeisance in their turn, and passing on to make room for others.  Following were the merchants, the tanners, the spear-makers and all the other acknowledged Guilds, deliberately attired (so it seemed to me) that they might make a pageant; and whilst most walked on foot, there were some who proudly rode on beasts which they had tamed into rendering them this menial service.  But presently came the two wonders of all that dazzling spectacle.  From out of the eclipse of the houses there swung into the open no less a beast than a huge bull mammoth.  The sight had sufficient surprise in it almost to make me start.  Many a time during my life had I led hunts to kill the mammoth, when a herd of them had raided some village or cornland under my charge.  I had seen the huge brutes in the wild ground, shaggy, horrid, monstrous; more fierce than even the cave-tiger or the cave-bear; most dangerous beast of all that fight with man for dominion of the earth, save only for a few of the greater lizards.  And here was this creature, a giant even amongst mammoths, yet tame as any well-whipped slave, and bearing upon its back a great half-castle of gold, stamped with the outstretched hand, and bedecked with silver snakes.  Its murderous tusks were gilded, its hairy neck was garlanded with flowers, and it trod on in the procession as though assisting at such pageantry was the beginning and end of its existence.  Its tameness seemed a fitting symbol of the masterful strength of this new ruler of Atlantis.  Simultaneously with the mammoth, there came into sight that other and greater wonder, the mammoth's mistress, the Empress Phorenice.  The beast took my eye at the first, from its very uncouth hugeness, from its show of savage power restrained; but the lady who sat in the golden half-castle on its lofty back quickly drew away my gaze, and held it immovable from then onwards with an infinite attraction.  I stood to my feet when the people first shouted at Phorenice's approach, and remained in the porchway of my scarlet pavilion till her vast steed had halted in the centre of the square, and then I advanced across the pavement towards her.  "On your knees, my lord," said one of the chamberlains behind me, in a scared whisper.  "At least with bent head," urged another.  But I had my own notions of what is due to one's own self-respect in these matters, and I marched across the bare open space with head erect, giving the Empress gaze for gaze.  She was clearly summing me up. I was frankly doing the like by her.  Gods! but those few short seconds made me see a woman such as I never imagined could have lived.  I know I have placed it on record earlier in this writing that, during all the days of a long official life, women have had no influence over me.  But I have been quick to see that they often had a strong swaying power over the policies of others, and as a consequence I have made it my business to study them even as I have studied men.  But this woman who sat under the sacred snakes in her golden half-castle on the mammoth's back, fairly baffled me.  Of her thoughts I could read no single syllable.  I could see a body slight, supple, and beautifully moulded; in figure rather small.  Her face was a most perfect book of cleverness, yet she was fair, too, beyond belief, with hair of a lovely ruddiness, cut short in the new fashion, and bunching on her shoulders.  And eyes!  Gods! who could plumb the depths of Phorenice's eyes, or find in mere tint a trace of their heaven-made colour?  It was plain, also, that she in her turn was searching me down to my very soul, and it seemed that her scrutiny was not without its satisfaction.  She moved her head in little nods as I drew near, and when I did the requisite obeisance permitted to my rank, she bade me in a voice loud and clear enough for all at hand to hear, never to put forehead on the ground again on her behalf so long as she ruled in Atlantis.  "For others," she said, "it is fitting that they should do so, once, twice, or several times, according to their rank and station, for I am Empress, and they are all so far beneath me; but you are Deucalion, my lord, and though till to-day I knew you only from pictures drawn with tongues, I have seen you now, and have judged for myself.  And so I make this decree: Deucalion is above all other men in Atlantis, and if there is one who does not render him obedience, that man is enemy also of Phorenice, and shall feel her anger."  She made a sign, and a stair was brought, and then she called to me, and I mounted and sat beside her in the golden half-castle under the canopy of royal snakes.  The girl who stood behind in attendance fanned us both with perfumed feathers, and at a word from Phorenice the mammoth was turned, bearing us back towards the royal pyramid by the way through which it had come.  At the same time also all the other machinery of splendour was put in motion.  The soldiers and the gaudily bedecked civil traders fell into procession before and behind, and I noted that a body of troops, heavily armed, marched on each of the mammoth's flanks.  Phorenice turned to me with a smile.  "You piqued me," she said, "at first."  "Your Majesty overwhelms me with so much notice."  "You looked at my steed before you looked at me.  A woman finds it hard to forgive a slight like that."  "I envied you the greatest of your conquests, and do still.  I have fought mammoths myself, and at times have killed, but I never dared even to think of taking one alive and bringing it into tameness."  "You speak boldly," she said, still smiling, "and yet you can turn a pretty compliment.  Faugh!  Deucalion, the way these people fawn on me gives me a nausea.  I am not of the same clay as they are, I know; but just because I am the daughter of Gods they must needs feed me on the pap of insincerity."  So Tatho was right, and the swineherd was forgotten.  Well, if she chose to keep up the fiction she had made, it was not my part to contradict her.  Rightly or wrongly I was her servant.  "I have been pining this long enough for a stronger meat than they can give," she went on, "and at last I have sent for you.  I have been at some pains to procure my tongue-pictures of you, Deucalion, and though you do not know me yet, I may say I knew you with all thoroughness even before we met.  I can admire a man with a mind great enough to forego the silly gauds of clothes, or the excesses of feasts, or the pamperings of women."  She looked down at her own silks and her glittering jewels.  "We women like to carry colours upon our persons, but that is a different matter.  And so I sent for you here to be my minister, and bear with me the burden of ruling."  "There should be better men in broad Atlantis."  "There are not, my lord, and I who know them all by heart tell you so.  They are all enamoured of my poor person; they weary me with their empty phrases and their importunities; and, though they are always brimming with their cries of service, their own advancement and the filling of their own treasuries ever comes first with them.  So I have sent for you, Deucalion, the one strong man in all the world.  You at least will not sigh to be my lover?"  I saw her watching for my answer from the corner of her eyes.  "The Empress," I said, "is my mistress, and I will be an honest minister to her.  With Phorenice, the woman, it is likely that I shall have little enough to do.  Besides, I am not the sort that sports with this toy they call love."  "And yet you are a personable man enough," she said rather thoughtfully.  "But that still further proves your strength, Deucalion.  You at least will not lose your head through weak infatuation for my poor looks and graces."--She turned to the girl who stood behind us.--"Ylga, fan not so violently."  Our talk broke off then for the moment, and I had time to look about me.  We were passing through the chief street in the fairest, the most wonderful city this world has ever seen.  I had left it a score of years before, and was curious to note its increase.  In public buildings the city had certainly made growth; there were new temples, new pyramids, new palaces, and statuary everywhere.  Its greatness and magnificence impressed me more strongly even than usual, returning to it as I did from such a distance of time and space, for, though the many cities of Yucatan might each of them be princely, this great capital was a place not to be compared with any of them.  It was imperial and gorgeous beyond descriptive words.  Yet most of all was I struck by the poverty and squalor which stood in such close touch with all this magnificence.  In the throngs that lined the streets there were gaunt bodies and hungry faces everywhere.  Here and there stood one, a man or a woman, as naked as a savage in Europe, and yet dull to shame.  Even the trader, with trumpery gauds on his coat, aping the prevailing fashion for display, had a scared, uneasy look to his face, as though he had forgotten the mere name of safety, and hid a frantic heart with his tawdry outward vauntings of prosperity.  Phorenice read the direction of my looks.  "The season," she said, "has been unhealthy of recent months.  These lower people will not build fine houses to adorn my city, and because they choose to live on in their squalid, unsightly kennels, there have been calentures and other sicknesses amongst them, which make them disinclined for work.  And then, too, for the moment, earning is not easy.  Indeed, you may say trade is nearly stopped this last half-year, since the rebels have been hammering so lustily at my city gates."  I was fairly startled out of my decorum.  "Rebels!" I cried.  "Who are hammering at the gates of Atlantis?  Is the city in a state of siege?"  "Of their condescension," said Phorenice lightly, "they are giving us holiday to-day, and so, happily, my welcome to you comes undisturbed.  If they were fighting, your ears would have told you of it.  To give them their due, they are noisy enough in all their efforts.  My spies say they are making ready new engines for use against the walls, which you may sally out to-morrow and break if it gives you amusement.  But for to-day, Deucalion, I have you, and you have me, and there is peace round us, and some prettiness of display.  If you ask for more I will give it you."  "I did not know of this rebellion," I said, "but as Your Majesty has made me your minister, it is well that I should know all about its scope at once.  This is a matter we should be serious upon."  "And do you think I cannot take it seriously also?" she retorted.  "Ylga," she said to the girl that stood behind, "set loose my dress at the shoulder."  And when the attendant had unlinked the jewelled clasp (as it seemed to me with a very ill grace), she herself stripped down the fabric, baring the pure skin beneath, and showing me just below the curve of the left breast a bandage of bloodstained linen.  "There is a guarantee of my seriousness yesterday, at any rate," she said, looking at me sidelong.  "The arrow struck on a rib and that saved me.  If it had struck between, Deucalion would have been standing beside my funeral pyre to-day instead of riding on this pretty steed of mine which he admires so much.  Your eye seems to feast itself most on the mammoth, Deucalion.  Ah, poor me.  I am not one of your shaggy creatures, and so it seems I shall never be able to catch your regard.  Ylga," she said to the girl behind, "you may link my dress up again with its clasp.  My Lord Deucalion has seen wounds before, and there is nothing else here to interest him."    5.  ZAEMON'S CURSE   It appeared that for the present at any rate I was to have my residence in the royal pyramid.  The glittering cavalcade drew up in the great paved square which lies before the building, and massed itself in groups.  The mammoth was halted before the doorway, and when a stair had been brought, the trumpets sounded, and we three who had ridden in the golden half-castle under the canopy of snakes, descended to the ground.  It was plain that we were going from beneath the open sky to the apartments which lay inside the vast stone mazes of the pyramid, and without thinking, the instinct of custom and reverence that had become part of my nature caused me to turn to where the towering rocks of the Sacred Mountain frowned above the city, and make the usual obeisance, and offer up in silence the prescribed prayer.  I say I did this thing unthinking, and as a matter of common custom, but when I rose to my feet, I could have sworn I heard a titter of laughter from somewhere in that fancifully bedecked crowd of onlookers.  I glanced in the direction of the scoffers, frowningly enough, and then I turned to Phorenice to demand their prompt punishment for the disrespect.  But here was a strange thing.  I had looked to see her in the act and article of rising from an obeisance; but there she was, standing erect, and had clearly never touched her forehead to the ground.  Moreover, she was regarding me with a queer look which I could not fathom.  But whatever was in her mind, she had no plan to bawl about it then before the people collected in the square.  She said to me, "Come," and, turning to the doorway, cried for entrance, giving the secret word appointed for the day.  The ponderous stone blocks, which barred the porch, swung back on their hinges, and with stately tread she passed out of the hot sunshine into the cool gloom beyond, with the fan-girl following decorously at her heels.  With a heaviness beginning to grow at my heart, I too went inside the pyramid, and the stone doors, with a sullen thud, closed behind us.  We did not go far just then.  Phorenice halted in the hall of waiting.  How well I remembered the place, with the pictures of kings on its red walls, and the burning fountain of earth-breath which blazed from a jet of bronze in the middle of the flooring and gave it light.  The old King that was gone had come this far of his complaisance when he bade me farewell as I set out twenty years before for my vice-royalty in Yucatan.  But the air of the hall was different to what it had been in those old days.  Then it was pure and sweet.  Now it was heavy with some scent, and I found it languid and oppressive.  "My minister," said the Empress, "I acquit you of intentional insult; but I think the colonial air has made you a very simple man.  Such an obeisance as you showed to that mountain not a minute since has not been made since I was sent to reign over this kingdom."  "Your Majesty," I said, "I am a member of the Priests' Clan and was brought up in their tenets.  I have been taught, before entering a house, to thank the Gods, and more especially our Lord the Sun, for the good air that He and They have provided.  It has been my fate more than once to be chased by streams of fire and stinking air amongst the mountains during one of their sudden boils, and so I can say the prescribed prayer upon this matter straight from my heart."  "Circumstances have changed since you left Atlantis," said Phorenice, "and when thanks are given now, they are not thrown at those old Gods."  I saw her meaning, and almost started at the impiety of it.  If this was to be the new rule of things, I would have no hand in it.  Fate might deal with me as it chose.  To serve truly a reigning monarch, that I was prepared for; but to palter with sacrilege, and accept a swineherd's daughter as a God, who should receive prayers and obeisances, revolted my manhood.  So I invited a crisis.  "Phorenice," I said, "I have been a priest from my childhood up, revering the Gods, and growing intimate with their mysteries.  Till I find for myself that those old things are false, I must stand by that allegiance, and if there is a cost for this faithfulness I must pay it."  She looked at me with a slow smile.  "You are a strong man, Deucalion," she said.  I bowed.  "I have heard others as stubborn," she said, "but they were converted."  She shook out the ruddy bunches of her hair, and stood so that the light of the burning earth-breath might fall on the loveliness of her face and form.  "I have found it as easy to convert the stubborn as to burn them.  Indeed, there has been little talk of burning.  They have all rushed to conversion, whether I would or no.  But it seems that my poor looks and tongue are wanting in charm to-day."  "Phorenice is Empress," I said stolidly, "and I am her servant.  To-morrow, if she gives me leave, I will clear away this rabble which clamours outside the walls.  I must begin to prove my uses."  "I am told you are a pretty fighter," said she.  "Well, I hold some small skill in arms myself, and have a conceit that I am something of a judge.  To-morrow we will take a taste of battle together.  But to-day I must carry through the honourable reception I have planned for you, Deucalion.  The feast will be set ready soon, and you will wish to make ready for the feast.  There are chambers here selected for your use, and stored with what is needful.  Ylga will show you their places."  We waited, the fan-girl and I, till Phorenice had passed out of the glow of the light-jet, and had left the hall of waiting through a doorway amongst the shadows of its farther angle, and then (the girl taking a lamp and leading) we also threaded our way through the narrow mazes of the pyramid.  Everywhere the air was full of perfumes, and everywhere the passages turned and twisted and doubled through the solid stone of the pyramid, so that strangers might have spent hours--yes, or days--in search before they came to the chamber they desired.  There was a fine cunningness about those forgotten builders who set up this royal pyramid.  They had no mind that kings should fall by the hand of vulgar assassins who might come in suddenly from outside.  And it is said also that the king of the time, to make doubly sure, killed all that had built the pyramid, or seen even the lay of its inner stones.  But the fan-girl led the way with the lamp swinging in her hand, as one accustomed to the mazes.  Here she doubled, there she turned, and here she stopped in the middle of a blank wall to push a stone, which swung to let us pass.  And once she pressed at the corner of a flagstone on the floor, which reared up to the thrust of her foot, and showed us a stair steep and narrow.  That we descended, coming to the foot of an inclined way which led us upward again; and so by degrees we came unto the chamber which had been given for my use.  "There is raiment in all these chests which stand by the walls," said the girl, "and jewels and gauds in that bronze coffer.  They are Phorenice's first presents, she bid me say, and but a small earnest of what is to come.  My Lord Deucalion can drop his simplicity now, and fig himself out in finery to suit the fashion."  "Girl," I said sharply, "be more decorous with your tongue, and spare me such small advice."  "If my Lord Deucalion thinks this a rudeness, he can give a word to Phorenice, and I shall be whipped.  If he asks it, I can be stripped and scourged before him.  The Empress will do much for Deucalion just now."  "Girl," I said, "you are nearer to that whipping than you think for."  "I have got a name," she retorted, looking at me sullenly from under her black brows.  "They call me Ylga.  You might have heard that as we rode here on the mammoth, had you not been so wrapped up in Phorenice."  I gazed at her curiously.  "You have never seen me before," I said, "and the first words you utter are those that might well bring trouble to yourself.  There is some object in all this."  She went and pushed to the massive stone that swung in the doorway of the chamber.  Then she put her little jewelled fingers on my garment and drew me carefully away from the airshaft into the farther corner.  "I am the daughter of Zaemon," she said, "whom you knew."  "You bring me some message from him?"  "How could I?  He lives in the priests' dwellings on the Mountain you did obeisance to.  I have not put eyes on him these two years.  But when I saw you first step out from that red pavilion they had pitched at the harbour side, I--I felt a pity for you, Deucalion.  I remembered you were my father's, Zaemon's, friend, and I knew what Phorenice had in store.  She has been plotting it all these two months."  "I cannot hear words against the Empress."  "And yet--"  "What?"  She stamped her sandal upon the stone of the floor.  "You must be a very blind man, Deucalion, or a very daring one.  But I shall not interfere further; at least not now.  Still, I shall watch, and if at any time you seem to want a friend I will try and serve you."  "I thank you for your friendship."  "You seem to take it lightly enough.  Why, sir, even now I do not believe you know my power, any more than you guess my motive.  You may be first man in this kingdom, but let me tell you I rank as second lady.  And remember, women stand high in Atlantis now.  Believe me, my friendship is a commodity that has been sought with frequence and industry."  "And as I say, I am grateful for it.  You seem to think little enough of my gratitude, Ylga; but, credit me, I never have bestowed it on a woman before, and so you should treasure it for its rarity."  "Well," she said, "my lord, there is an education before you."  She left me then, showing me how to call slaves when I wished for their help, and for a full minute I stood wondering at the words I had spoken to her.  Who was the daughter of Zaemon that she should induce me to change the habit of a lifetime?  The slaves came at my bidding, and showed themselves anxious to deck me with a thousand foolishnesses in the matter of robes and gauds, and (what seemed to be the modern fashion of their class) holding out the virtues of a score of perfumes and unguents.  Their manner irritated me.  Clean I was already, and shaved; my hair was trim, and my robe was unsoiled; and, considering these pressing attentions of theirs something of an impertinence, I set them to beat one another as a punishment, promising that if they did not do it with thoroughness, I would hand them on to the brander to be marked with stripes which would endure.  It is strange, but a common menial can often surpass even a rebellious general in power of ruffling one.  I had seen many strange sights that day, and undergone many new sensations; but of all the things which came to my notice, Phorenice's manner of summoning the guests to her feast surprised me most.  Nay, it did more; it shocked me profoundly; and I cannot say whether amazement at her profanity, or wonder at her power, was for the moment strongest in my breast.  I sat in my chamber awaiting the summons, when gradually, growing out of nothing, a sound fell upon my ear which increased in volume with infinitely small graduations, till at last it became a clanging din which hurt the ear with its fierceness; and then (I guessed what was coming) the whole massive fabric of the pyramid trembled and groaned and shook, as though it had been merely a child's wooden toy brushed about by a strong man's sandal.  It was the portent served out yearly by the chiefs of the Priests' Clan on the Sacred Mountain, when they bade all the world take count of their sins.  It was the sacred reminder that from roaring, raging fire, and from the agony of monstrous earth-tremors, man had been born, and that by these same agencies he would eventually be swallowed up--he and the sins within his breast.  And here the Empress was prostituting its solemnities into a mere call to gluttony, and sign for ribald laughter and sensuous display.  But how had she acquired the authority to do this thing?  Who was she that she should tamper with those dimly understood powers, the forces that dwell within the liquid heart of our mother earth?  Had there been treachery?  Had some member of the Priests' Clan forgotten his sacred vows, and babbled to this woman matters concerning the holy mysteries?  Or had Phorenice discovered a key to these mysteries with her own agile brain?  If that last was the case, I could continue to serve her with silent conscience.  Though she might be none of my making, at least she was Empress, and it was my duty to give her obedience.  But if she had suborned some weaker member of the Clan on the Sacred Mount, that would be a different matter.  For be it remembered that it was one of the elements of our constitution to preserve our secrets and mysteries inviolate, and to pursue with undying hatred both the man who had dared to betray them, and the unhappy recipient of his confidence.  It was with very undecided feelings, then, that I obeyed the summons of the earth-shaking, and bade the slaves lead me through the windings of the pyramid to the great banqueting-hall.  The scene there was dazzling.  The majestic chamber with its marvellous carvings was filled with a company decked out with all the gauds and colours that fancy could conceive.  Little recked they of the solemn portent which had summoned them to the meal, of the death and misery that stalked openly through the city wards without, of the rebels which lay in leaguer beyond the, walls, of the neglected Gods and their clan of priests on the Sacred Mountain.  They were all gluttonous for the passions of the moment; it was their fashion and conceit to look at nothing beyond.  Flaming jets of earth-breath lit the great hall to the brightness of midday; and when I stepped out upon the pavement, trumpets blared, so that all might know of my coming.  But there was no roar of welcome.  "Deucalion," they lisped with mincing voices, bowing themselves ridiculously to the ground so that all their ornaments and silks might jangle and swish.  Indeed, when Phorenice herself appeared, and all sent up their cries and made lawful obeisance, there was the same artificiality in the welcome.  They meant well enough, it is true; but this was the new fashion.  Heartiness had come to be accounted a barbarism by this new culture.  A pair of posturing, smirking chamberlains took me in charge, and ushered me with their flimsy golden wands to the dais at the farther end.  It appeared that I was to sit on Phorenice's divan, and eat my meat out of her dish.  "There is no stint to the honour the Empress puts upon me," I said, as I knelt down and took my seat.  She gave me one of her queer, sidelong looks.  "Deucalion may have more beside, if he asks for it prettily.  He may have what all the other men in the known world have sighed for, and what none of them will ever get.  But I have given enough of my own accord; he must ask me warmly for those further favours."  "I ask," I said, "first, that I may sweep the boundaries clear of this rabble which is clamouring against the city walls."  "Pah," she said, and frowned.  "Have you appetite only for the sterner pleasures of life?  My good Deucalion, they must have been rustic folk in that colony of yours.  Well, you shall give me news now of the toothsomeness of this feast."  Dishes and goblets were placed before us, and we began to eat, though I had little enough appetite for victual so broken and so highly spiced.  But if this finicking cookery and these luscious wines did not appeal to me, the other diners in that gorgeous hall appreciated it all to the full.  They sat about in groups on the pavement beneath the light-jets like a tangle of rainbows for colour, and according to the new custom they went into raptures and ecstasies over their enjoyment.  Women and men both, they lingered over each titillation of the palate as though it were a caress of the Gods.  Phorenice, with her quick, bright eyes, looked on, and occasionally flung one or another a few words between her talk with me, and now and again called some favoured creature up to receive a scrap of viand from the royal dish.  This the honoured one would eat with extravagant gesture, or (as happened twice) would put it away in the folds of his clothes as a treasure too dear to be profaned by human lips.  To me, this flattery appeared gross and disgustful, but Phorenice, through use, perhaps, seemed to take it as merely her due.  There was, one had to suppose, a weakness in her somewhere, though truly to the outward seeing none was apparent.  Her face was strong enough, and it was subtle also, and, moreover, it was wondrous comely.  All the courtiers in the banqueting-hall raved about Phorenice's face and the other beauties of her body and limbs, and though not given to appreciation in these matters, I could not but see that here at least they had a groundwork for their admiration, for surely the Gods have never favoured mortal woman more highly.  Yet lovely though she might be, for myself I preferred to look upon Ylga, the girl, who, because of her rank, was privileged to sit on the divan behind us as immediate attendant.  There was an honesty in Ylga's face which Phorenice's lacked.  They did not eat to nutrify their bodies, these feasters in the banqueting-hall of the royal pyramid, but they all ate to cloy themselves, and they strutted forth new usages with every platter and bowl that the slaves brought.  To me some of their manners were closely touching on disrespect.  At the halfway of the meal, a gorgeous popinjay--he was a governor of an out-province driven into the capital by a rebellion in his own lands--this gorgeous fop, I say, walked up between the groups of feasters with flushed face and unsteady gait, and did obeisance before the divan.  "Most astounding Empress," cried he, "fairest among the Goddesses, Queen regnant of my adoring heart, hail!"  Phorenice with a smile stretched him out her cup.  I looked to see him pour respectful libation, but no such thing.  He set the drink to his lips and drained it to the final drop.  "May all your troubles," he cried, "pass from you as easily, and leave as pleasant a flavour."  The Empress turned to me with one of her quick looks.  "You do not like this new habit?"  To which I replied bluntly enough that to pour out liquor at a person's feet had grown through custom to be a mark of respect, but that drinking it seemed to me mere self-indulgence, which might be practised anywhere.  "You still keep to the old austere teachings," she said.  "Our newer code bids us enjoy life first, and order other things so as not to meddle with our more immediate pleasure."  And so the feast went on, the guests practising their gluttonies and their absurdities, and the guards standing to their arms round the circuit of the walls as motionless and as stern as the statues carven in the white stone beyond them.  But a term was put to the orgy with something of suddenness.  There was a stir at the farther doorway of the banqueting-hall, and a clash, as two of the guards joined their spears across the entrance.  But the man they tried to stop--or perhaps it was to pin--passed them unharmed, and walked up over the pavement between the lights, and the groups of feasters.  All looked round at him; a few threw him ribald words; but none ventured to stop his progress.  A few, women chiefly, I could see, shuddered as he passed them by, as though a wintry chill had come over them; and in the end he walked up and stood in front of Phorenice's divan, and gazed fixedly on her, but without making obeisance.  He was a frail old man, with white hair tumbling on his shoulders, and ragged white beard.  The mud of wayfaring hung in clots on his feet and legs.  His wizened body was bare save for a single cloth wound about his shoulders and his loins, and he carried in his hand a wand with the symbol of our Lord the Sun glowing at its tip.  That wand went to show his caste, but in no other way could I recognize him.  I took him for one of those ascetics of the Priests' Clan, who had forsworn the steady nurtured life of the Sacred Mountain, and who lived out in the dangerous lands amongst the burning hills, where there is daily peril from falling rocks, from fire streams, from evil vapours, from sudden fissuring of the ground, and from other movements of those unstable territories, and from the greater lizards and other monstrous beasts which haunt them.  These keep constant in the memory the might of the Holy Gods, and the insecurity of this frail earth on which we have our resting-place, and so the sojourners there become chastened in the spirit, and gain power over mysteries which even the most studious and learned of other men can never hope to attain.  A silence filled the room when the old man came to his halt, and Phorenice was the first to break it.  "Those two guards," she said, in her clear, carrying voice, "who held the door, are not equal to their work.  I cannot have imperfect servants; remove them."  The soldiers next in the rank lifted their spears and drove them home, and the two fellows who had admitted the old man fell to the ground.  One shrieked once, the other gave no sound: they were clever thrusts both.  The old man found his voice, thin, and high, and broken.  "Another crime added to your tally, Phorenice.  Not half your army could have hindered my entrance had I wished to come, and let me tell you that I am here to bring you your last warning.  The Gods have shown you much favour; they gave you merit by which you could rise above your fellows, till at last only the throne stood above you.  It was seen good by those on the Sacred Mountain to let you have this last ambition, and sit on this throne that has as long and honourably been filled by the ancient kings of Atlantis."  The Empress sat back on the divan smiling.  "I seemed to get these things as I chose, and in spite of your friends' teeth.  I may owe to you, old man, a small parcel of thanks, though that I offered to repay; but for my lords the priests, their permission was of small enough value when it came.  I would have you remember that I was as firm on the throne of Atlantis as this pyramid stands upon its base when your worn-out priests came up to give their tottering benediction."  The old man waved aside her interruption.  "Hear me out," he said.  "I am here with no trivial message.  There is nothing paltry about the threat I can throw at you, Phorenice.  With your fire-tubes, your handling of troops, and your other fiendish clevernesses, you may not be easy to overthrow by mere human means, though, forsooth, these poor rebels who yap against your city walls have contrived to hold their ground for long enough now.  It may be that you are becoming enervated; I do not know.  It may be that you are too wrapped up in your feastings, your dressings, your pomps, and your debaucheries, to find leisure to turn to the art of war.  It may be that the man's spirit has gone out from your arm and brain, and you are a woman once more--weak, and pleasure-loving; again I do not know.  "But this must happen: You must undo the evil you have done; you must give bread to the people who are starving, even if you take it from these gluttons in this hall; you must restore Atlantis to the state in which it was entrusted to you: or else you must be removed.  It cannot be permitted that the country should sink back into the lawlessness and barbarism from which its ancient kings have digged it.  You hear, Phorenice.  Now give me true answer."  "Speak him fair.  Oh!  For the sake of your fortune, speak him fair," came Ylga's voice in a hurried whisper from behind us.  But the Empress took no notice of it.  She leaned forward on the cushions of the divan with a knit brow.  "Do you dare to threaten me, old man, knowing what I am?"  "I know your origin," he said gravely, "as well as you know it yourself.  As for my daring, that is a small matter.  He need be but a timid man who dares to say words that the High Gods put on his lips."  "I shall rule this kingdom as I choose.  I shall brook interference from no creature on this earth, or beneath it, or in the sky above.  The Gods have chosen me to be Their regent in Atlantis, and They do not depose me through such creatures as you.  Go away, old man, and play the fanatic in another court.  It is well that I have an ancient kindliness for you, or you would not leave this place unharmed."   "Now, indeed, you are lost," I heard Ylga murmur from behind, and the old man in front of us did not move a step.  Instead, he lifted up the Symbol of our Lord the Sun, and launched his curse.  "Your blasphemy gives the reply I asked for.  Hear me now make declaration of war on behalf of Those against whom you have thrown your insults.  You shall be overthrown and sent to the nether Gods.  At whatever cost the land shall be purged of you and yours, and all the evil that has been done to it whilst you have sullied the throne of its ancient kings.  You will not amend, neither will you yield tamely.  You vaunt that you sit as firm on your throne as this pyramid reposes on its base.  See how little you know of what the future carries.  I say to you that, whilst you are yet Empress, you shall see this royal pyramid which you have polluted with your debaucheries torn tier from tier, and stone from stone, and scattered as feathers spread before a wind."  "You may wreck the pyramid," said Phorenice contemptuously.  "I myself have some knowledge of the earth forces, as I have shown this night.  But though you crumble every stone above us now and grind it into grit and dust, I shall still be Empress.  What force can you crazy priests bring against me that I cannot throw back and destroy?"  "We have a weapon that was forged in no mortal smithy," shrilled the old man, "whereof the key is now lodged in the Ark of the Mysteries.  But that weapon can be used only as a last resource.  The nature of it even is too awful to be told in words.  Our other powers will be launched against you first, and for this poor country's sake I pray that they may cause you to wince.  Yet rest assured, Phorenice, that we shall not step aside once we have put a hand to this matter.  We shall carry it through, even though the cost be a universal burning and destruction.  For know this, daughter of the swineherd, it is agreed amongst the most High Gods that you are too full of sin to continue unchecked."  "Speak him fairly," Ylga urged from behind.  "He has a power at which you cannot even guess."  The Empress made to rise, but Ylga clung to her skirt.  "For the sake of your fame," she urged, "for the sake of your life, do not defy him."  But Phorenice struck her fiercely aside, and faced the old man in a tumult of passion.  "You dare call me a blasphemer, who blaspheme yourself?  You dare cast slurs upon my birth, who am come direct from the most high Heaven?  Old man, your craziness protects you in part, but not in all.  You shall be whipped.  Do you hear me?  I say, whipped.  The lean flesh shall be scourged from your scraggy bones, and you shall totter away from this place as a red and bleeding example for those who would dare traduce their Empress.  Here, some of you, I say, take that man, and let him be whipped where he stands."  Her cry went out clearly enough.  But not a soul amongst those glittering feasters stirred in his place.  Not a soldier amongst the guards stepped from his rank.  The place was hung in a terrible silence.  It seemed as though no one within the hall dared so much as to draw a breath.  All felt that the very air was big with fate.  Phorenice, with her head crouched forward, looked from one group to another.  Her face was working.  "Have I no true servants," she asked, "amongst all you pretty lip-servers?"  Still no one moved.  They stood, or sat, or crouched like people fascinated.  For myself, with the first words he had uttered, I had recognized the old man by his voice.  It was Zaemon, the weak governor who had given the Empress her first step towards power; that earnest searcher into the mysteries, who knew more of their powers, and more about the hidden forces, than any other dweller on the Sacred Mountain, even at that time when I left for my colony.  And now, during his strange hermit life, how much more might he not have learned?  I was torn by warring duties.  I owed much to the Priests' Clan, by reason of my oath and membership; it seemed I owed no less to Phorenice.  And, again, was Zaemon the truly accredited envoy of the high council of the priests of the Sacred Mountain?  And was the Empress of a truth deposed by the High Gods above, or was she still Empress, and still the commander of my duty?  I could not tell, and so I sat in my seat awaiting what the event would sow.  Phorenice's fury was growing.  "Do I stand alone here?" she cried.  "Have I pampered you creatures out of all touch with gratitude?  It seems that at last I want a new chief to my guards.  Ho!  Who will be chief of the guards of the Empress?"  There was a shifting of eyes, a hesitation.  Then a great burly form strode up from the farther end of the hall, and a perceptible shudder went up from all the others as they watched him.  "So, Tarca, you prefer to take the risks, and remain chief of the guard yourself?" she said with an angry scoff.  "Truly there did not seem to be many thrusting forward to strip you of the office.  I shall have a fine sorting up of places in payment for this night's work.  But for the present, Tarca, do your duty."  The man came up, obviously timorous.  He was a solidly made fellow, but not altogether unmartial, and though but little of his cheek showed above his decorated beard, I could see that he paled as he came near to the priest.  "My lord," he said quietly, "I must ask you to come with me."  "Stand aside," said the old man, thrusting out the Symbol in front of him.  I could see his eyes gather on the soldier and his brows knit with a strain of will.  Tarca saw this too, and I thought he would have fallen, but with an effort he kept his manhood, and doggedly repeated his summons.  "I must obey the command of my mistress, and I would have you remember, my lord, that I am but a servant.  You must come with me to the whip."  "I warn you!" cried the old man.  "Stand from out of my path, you!"  It must have been with the courage of desperation that the soldier dared to use force.  But the hand he stretched out dropped limply back to his side the moment it touched the old man's bare shoulder, as though it had been struck by some shock.  He seemed almost to have expected some such repulse; yet when he picked up that hand with the other, and looked at it, and saw its whiteness, he let out of him a yell like a wounded beast.  "Oh, Gods!" he cried.  "Not that.  Spare me!"  But Zaemon was glowering at him still.  A twitching seized the man's face, and he put up his sound hand to it and plucked at his beard, which was curled and plaited after the new fashion of the day.  A woman standing near screamed as the half of the beard came off in his fingers.  Beneath was silver whiteness over half his face.  Zaemon had smitten him with a sudden leprosy that was past cure.  Yet the punishment was not ended even then.  Other twitchings took him on other parts of the body, and he tore off his armour and his foppish clothes, and always where the bare flesh showed, there had the horrid plague written its white mark; and in the end, being able to endure no more, the man fell to the pavement and lay there writhing.  Zaemon said no further word.  He lifted the Symbol before him, set his eyes on the farther door of the banqueting-hall and walked for it directly, all those in his path shrinking away from him with open shudders.  And through the valves of the door he passed out of our sight, still wordless, still unchecked.   I glanced up at Phorenice.  The loveliness of her face was drawn and haggard.  It was the first great reverse, this, she had met with in all her life, and the shock of it, and the vision of what might follow after, dazed her.  Alas, if she could only have guessed at a tenth of the terrors which the future had in its womb, Atlantis might have been saved even then.    6.  THE BITERS OF THE CITY WALLS   Here then was the manner of my reception back in the capital of Atlantis, and some first glimpse at her new policies.  I freely confess to my own inaction and limpness; but it was all deliberate.  The old ties of duty seemed lost, or at least merged in one another.  Beforetime, to serve the king was to serve the Clan of the Priests, from which he had been chosen, and whose head he constituted.  But Phorenice was self-made, and appeared to be a rule unto herself; if Zaemon was to be trusted, he was the mouthpiece of the Priests, and their Clan had set her at defiance; and how was a mere honest man to choose on the instant between the two?  But cold argument told me that governments were set up for the good of the country at large, and I said to myself that there would be my choice.  I must find out which rule promised best of Atlantis, and do my poor best to prop it into full power.  And here at once there opened up another path in the maze: I had heard some considerable talk of rebels; of another faction of Atlanteans who, whatever their faults might be, were at any rate strong enough to beleaguer the capital; and before coming to any final decision, it would be as well to take their claims in balance with the rest.  So on the night of that very same day on which I had just re-planted my foot on the old country's shores, I set out to glean for myself tidings on the matter.  No one inside the royal pyramid gainsaid me.  The banquet had ended abruptly with the terrible scene that I have set down above on these tablets, for with Tarca writhing on the floor, and thrusting out the gruesome scars of his leprosy, even the most gluttonous had little enough appetite for further gorging.  Phorenice glowered on the feasters for a while longer in silent fury, but saying no further word; and then her eyes turned on me, though softened somewhat.  "You may be an honest man, Deucalion," she said, at length, "but you are a monstrous cold one.  I wonder when you will thaw?"  And here she smiled.  "I think it will be soon.  But for now I bid you farewell.  In the morning we will take this country by the shoulders, and see it in some new order."  She left the banqueting-hall then, Ylga following; and taking precedence of my rank, I went out next, whilst all others stood and made salutation.  But I halted by Tarca first, and put my hand on his unclean flesh. "You are an unfortunate man," I said, "but I can admire a brave soldier.  If relief can be gained for your plague, I will use interest to procure it for you."  The man's thanks came in a mumble from his wrecked mouth, and some of those near shuddered in affected disgust. I turned on them with a black brow: "Your charity, my lords, seems of as small account as your courage.  You affected a fine disbelief of Zaemon's sayings, and a simpering contempt for his priesthood, but when it comes to laying a hand on him, you show a discretion which, in the old days, we should have called by an ugly name.  I had rather be Tarca, with all his uncleanness, than any of you now as you stand."  With which leave-taking I waited coldly till they gave me my due salutation, and then walked out of the banqueting-hall without offering a soul another glance.  I took my way to the grand gate of the pyramid, called for the officer of the guard, and demanded exit.  The man was obsequious enough, but he opened with some demur.  "My lord's attendants have not yet come up?"  "I have none."  "My lord knows the state of the streets?"  "I did twenty years back.  I shall be able to pick my way."  "My lord must remember that the city is beleaguered," the fellow persisted.  "The people are hungry.  They prowl in bands after nightfall, and--I make no question that my lord would conquer in a fight against whatever odds, but--"  "Quite right.  I covet no street scuffle to-night.  Lend me, I pray you, a sufficiency of men.  You will know best what are needed.  For me, I am accustomed to a city with quiet streets."  A score of sturdy fellows were detailed off for my escort, and with them in a double file on either hand, I marched out from the close perfumed air of the pyramid into the cool moonlight of the city.  It was my purpose to make a tour of the walls and to find out somewhat of the disposition of these rebels.  But the Gods saw fit to give me another education first.  The city, as I saw it during that night walk, was no longer the old capital that I had known, the just accretion of the ages, the due admixture of comfort and splendour.  The splendour was there, vastly increased.  Whole wards had been swept away to make space for new palaces, and new pyramids of the wealthy, and I could not but have an admiration for the skill and the brain which made possible such splendid monuments.  And, indeed, gazing at them there under the silver of the moonlight, I could almost understand the emotions of the Europeans and other barbarous savages which cause them to worship all such great buildings as Gods, since they deem them too wonderful and majestic to be set up by human hands unaided.  Still, if it was easy to admire, it was simple also to see plain advertisement of the cost at which these great works had been reared.  From each grant of ground, where one of these stately piles earned silver under the moon, a hundred families had been evicted and left to harbour as they pleased in the open; and, as a consequence, now every niche had its quota of sleepers, and every shadow its squad of fierce wild creatures, ready to rush out and rob or slay all wayfarers of less force than their own.  Myself, I am no pamperer of the common people.  I say that, if a man be left to hunger and shiver, he will work to gain him food and raiment; and if not, why then he can die, and the State is well rid of a worthless fellow.  But here beside us, as we marched through many wards, were marks of blind oppression; starved dead bodies, with the bones starting through the lean skin, sprawled in the gutter; and indeed it was plain that, save for the favoured few, the people of the great capital were under a most heavy oppression.  But at this, though I might regret it abominably, I could make no strong complaint.  By the ancient law of the land all the people, great and small, were the servants of the king, to be put without question to what purposes he chose; and Phorenice stood in the place of the king.  So I tried to think no treason, but with a sigh passed on, keeping my eyes above the miseries and the squalors of the roadway, and sending out my thoughts to the stars which hung in the purple night above, and to the High Gods which dwelt amongst them, seeking, if it might be, for guidance for my future policies.  And so in time the windings of the streets brought us to the walls, and, coursing beside these and giving fitting answer to the sentries who beat their drums as we passed, we came in time to that great gate which was a charge to the captain of the garrison.  Here it was plain there was some special commotion.  A noise of laughter went up into the still night air, and with it now and again the snarl and roar of a great beast, and now and again the shriek of a hurt man.  But whatever might be afoot, it was not a scene to come upon suddenly.  The entrance gates of our great capital were designed by their ancient builders to be no less strong than the walls themselves.  Four pairs of valves were there, each a monstrous block of stone two man-heights square, and a man-height thick, and the wall was doubled to receive them, enclosing an open circus between its two parts.  The four gates themselves were set one at the inner, one at the outer side of each of these walls, and a hidden machinery so connected them, that of each set one could not open till the other was closed; and as for forcing them without war engines, one might as foolishly try to push down the royal pyramid with the bare hand.  My escort made outcry with the horn which hung from the wall inviting such a summons, and a warder came to an arrow-slit, and did inspection of our persons and business.  His survey was according to the ancient form of words, which is long, and this was made still more tedious by the noise from within, which ever and again drowned all speech between us entirely.  But at last the formalities had been duly complied with, and he shot back the massive bars and bolts of stone, and threw ajar one monstrous stone valve of the door.  Into the chamber within--a chamber made from the thickness of the wall between the two doors--I and my fellows crowded, and then the warder with his machines pulled to the valve which had been opened, and came to me again through the press of my escort, bowing low to the ground.  "I have no vail to give you," I said abruptly.  "Get on with your duty.  Open me that other door."  "With respect, my lord, it would be better that I should first announce my lord's presence.  There is a baiting going forward in the circus, and the tigers are as yet mere savages, and no respecters of persons."  "The what?"  "The tigers, if my lord will permit them the name.  They are baiting a batch of prisoners with the two great beasts which the Empress (whose name be adored) has sent here to aid us keep the gate.  But if my lord will, there are the ward rooms leading off this passage, and the galleries which run out from them commanding the circus, and from there my lord can see the sport undisturbed."  Now, the mere lust for killing excites only disgust in me, but I suspected the orders of the Empress in this matter, and had a curiosity to see her scheme.  So I stepped into the warder's lodge, and on into the galleries which commanded the circus with their arrow-slits.  The old builders of the place had intended these for a second line of defence, for, supposing the outer doors all forced, an enemy could be speedily shot down in the circus, without being able to give a blow in return, and so would only march into a death-trap.  But as a gazing-place on a spectacle they were no less useful.  The circus was bright lit by the moonlight, and the air which came in to me from it was acrid with the reek of blood.  There was no sport in what was going forward: as I said, it was mere killing, and the sight disgusted me.  I am no prude about this matter.  Give a prisoner his weapons, put him in a pit with beasts of reasonable strength, and let him fight to a finish if you choose, and I can look on there and applaud the strokes.  The war prisoner, being a prisoner, has earned death by natural law, and prefers to get his last stroke in hot blood than to be knocked down by the headsman's axe.  And it is any brave man's luxury either to help or watch a lusty fight.  But this baiting in the circus between the gates was no fair battle like that.  To begin with, the beasts were no fair antagonists for single men.  In fact, twenty men armed might well have fled from them.  When the warder said tigers, I supposed he meant the great cats of the woods.  But here, in the circus, I saw a pair of the most terrific of all the fur-bearing land beasts, the great tigers of the caves--huge monsters, of such ponderous strength that in hunger they will oftentimes drag down a mammoth, if they can find him away from his herd.  How they had been brought captive I could not tell.  Hunter of beasts though I had been for all my days, I take no shame in saying that I always  approached the slaying of a cave-tiger with stratagem  and infinite caution.  To entrap it alive and bring it to a city on a chain was beyond my most daring schemes, and I have been accredited with more new things than one.  But here it was in fact, and I saw in these captive beasts a new certificate for Phorenice's genius.  The purpose of these two cave-tigers was plain: whilst they were in the circus, and loose, no living being could cross from one gate to the other.  They were a new and sturdy addition to the defences of the capital.  A collar of bronze was round the throat of each, and on the collar was a massive chain which led to the wall, where it could be payed out or hauled in by means of a windlass in one of the hidden galleries.  So that at ordinary moments the two huge beasts could be tethered, one close to either end of the circus, as the litter of bones and other messes showed, leaving free passage-way between the two sets of doors.  But when I stood there by the arrow-slit, looking down into the moonlight of the circus, these chains were slackened (though men stood by the windlass of each), and the great striped brutes were prowling about the circus with the links clanking and chinking in their wake.  Lying stark on the pavement were the bodies of some eight men, dead and uneaten; and though the cave-tigers stopped their prowlings now and again to nuzzle these, and beat them about with playful paw-blows, they made no pretence at commencing a meal.  It was clear that this cruel sport had grown common to them, and they knew there were other victims yet to be added to the tally.  Presently, sure enough, as I watched, a valve of the farther gate swung back an arm's length, and a prisoner, furiously resisting, was thrust out into the circus.  He fell on his face, and after one look around him he lay resolutely still, with eyes on the ground passively awaiting his fate.  The ponderous stone of the gate clapped to in its place; the cave-tigers turned in their prowlings; and a chatter of wagers ran to and fro amongst the watchers behind the arrow-slits.  It seemed there were niceties of cruelty in this wretched game.  There was a sharp clank as the windlasses were manned, and the tethering chains were drawn in by perhaps a score of links.  One of the cave-tigers crouched, lashed its tail, and launched forth on a terrific spring.  The chain tautened, the massive links sang to the strain, and the great beast gave a roar which shook the walls.  It had missed the prone man by a hand's breadth, and the watchers behind the arrow-slits shrieked forth their delight.  The other tiger sprang also and missed, and again there were shouts of pleasure, which mingled with the bellowing voices of the beasts.  The man lay motionless in his form.  One more cowardly, or one more brave, might have run from death, or faced it; but this poor prisoner chose the middle course--he permitted death to come to him, and had enough of doggedness to wait for it without stir.  The great cave-tigers were used, it appeared, to this disgusting sport.  There were no more wild springs, no more stubbings at the end of the massive chains.  They lay down on the pavement, and presently began to purr, rolling on to their sides and rubbing themselves luxuriously.  The prisoner still lay motionless in his form.  By slow degrees the monstrous brutes each drew to the end of its chain and began to reach at the man with out-stretched forepaw.  The male could not touch him; the female could just reach him with the far tip of a claw; and I saw a red scratch start up in the bare skin of his side at every stroke.  But still the prisoner would not stir.  It seemed to me that they must slack out more links of one of the tigers' chains, or let the vile play linger into mere tediousness.  But I had more to learn yet.  The male tiger, either taught by his own devilishness, or by those brutes that were his keepers, had still another ruse in store.  He rose to his feet and turned round, backing against the chain.  A yell of applause from the hidden men behind the arrow-slits told that they knew what was in store; and then the monstrous beast, stretched to the utmost of its vast length, kicked sharply with one hind paw.  I heard the crunch of the prisoner's ribs as the pads struck him, and at that same moment the poor wretch's body was spurned away by the blow, as one might throw a fruit with the hand.  But it did not travel far.  It was clear that the she-tiger knew this manoeuvre of her mate's.  She caught the man on his bound, nuzzling over him for a minute, and then tossing him high into the air, and leaping up to the full of her splendid height after him.  Those other onlookers thought it magnificent; their gleeful shouts said as much.  But for me, my gorge rose at the sight.  Once the tigers had reached him, the man had been killed, it is true, without any unnecessary lingering.  Even a light blow from those terrific paws would slay the strongest man living.  But to see the two cave-tigers toying with the poor body was an insult to the pride of our race.  However, I was not there to preach the superiority of man to the beasts, and the indecency and degradation of permitting man to be unduly insulted.  I had come to learn for myself the new balance of things in the kingdom of Atlantis, and so I stood at my place behind the arrow-slit with a still face.  And presently another scene in this ghastly play was enacted.  The cave-tigers tired of their sport, and first one and then the other fell once more to prowling over the littered pavements, with the heavy chains scraping and chinking in their wake.  They made no beginning to feast on the bodies provided for them.  That would be for afterwards.  In the present, the fascination of slaughter was big in them, and they had thought that it would be indulged further.  It seemed that they knew their entertainers.  Again the windlass clanked, and the tethering chains drew the great beasts clear of the doorway; and again a valve of the farther door swung ajar, and another prisoner was thrust struggling into the circus.  A sickness seized me when I saw that this was a woman, but still, in view of the object I had in hand, I made no interruption.  It was not that I had never seen women sent to death before.  A general, who has done his fighting, must in his day have killed women equally with men; yes, and seen them earn their death-blow by lusty battling.  Yet there seemed something so wanton in this cruel helpless sacrifice of a woman prisoner, that I had a struggle with myself to avoid interference.  Still it is ever the case that the individual must be sacrificed to a policy, and so as I say, I watched on, outwardly cold and impassive.  I watched too (I confess it freely) with a quickening heart.  Here was no sullen submissive victim like the last.  She may have been more cowardly (as some women are), she may have been braver (as many women have shown themselves); but, at any rate, it was clear that she was going to make a struggle for her life, and to do vicious damage, it might be, before she yielded it up.  The watchers behind the arrow-slits recognized this.  Their wagers, and the hum of their appreciation, swept loudly round the ring of the circus.  They stripped their prisoners, before they thrust them out to this death, of all the clothes they might carry, for clothes have a value; and so the woman stood there bare-limbed in the moonlight.  She clapped her back to the great stone door by which she had entered, and faced fate with glowing eye.  Gods! there have been times in early years when I could have plucked out sword and jumped down, and fought for her there for the sheer delight of such a battle.  But now policy restrained me.  The individual might want a helping hand, but it was becoming more and more clear that Atlantis wanted a minister also; and before these great needs, the lesser ones perforce must perish.  Still, be it noted that, if I did not jump down, no other man there that night had sufficient manhood remaining to venture the opportunity.  My heart glowed as I watched her.  She picked a bone from the litter on the pavement and beat off its head by blows against the wall.  Then with her teeth she fashioned the point to still further sharpness.  I could see her teeth glisten white in the moonrays as she bit with them.  The huge cave-tigers, which stood as high as her head as they walked, came nearer to her in their prowlings, yet obviously neglected her.  This was part of their accustomed scheme of torment, and the woman knew it well.  There was something intolerable in their noiseless, ceaseless paddings over the pavement.  I could see the prisoner's breast heave as she watched them.  A terror such as that would have made many a victim sick and helpless.  But this one was bolder than I had thought.  She did not wait for a spring: she made the first attack herself.  When the she-tiger made its stroll towards her, and was in the act of turning, she flung herself into a sudden leap, striking viciously at its eye with her sharpened bone.  A roar from the onlookers acknowledged the stroke.  The cave-tiger's eye remained undarkened, but the puny weapon had dealt it a smart flesh wound, and with a great bellow of surprise and pain it scampered away to gain space for a rush and a spring.  But the woman did not await its charge.  With a shrill scream she sped forward, running at the full of her speed across the moonlight directly towards that shadowed part of the encircling wall within whose thickness I had my gazing place; and then, throwing every tendon of her body into the spring, made the greatest leap that surely any human being ever accomplished, even when spurred on by the utmost of terror and desperation.  In an after day I measured it, and though of a certainty she must have added much to the tally by the sheer force of her run, which drove her clinging up the rough surface of the wall, it is a sure thing that in that splendid leap her feet must have dangled a man-height and a half above the pavement.  I say it was prodigious, but then the spur was more than the ordinary, and the woman herself was far out of the common both in thews and intelligence; and the end of the leap left her with five fingers lodged in the sill of the arrow-slit from which I watched.  Even then she must have slipped back if she had been left to herself, for the sill sloped, and the stone was finely smooth; but I shot out my hand and gripped hers by the wrist, and instantly she clambered up with both knees on the sills, and her fingers twined round to grip my wrist in her turn.  And now you will suppose she gushed out prayers and promises, thinking only of safety and enlargement.  There was nothing of this.  With savage panting wordlessness she took fresh grip on the sharpened bone with her spare hand, and lunged with it desperately through the arrow-slit.  With the hand that clutched mine she drew me towards her, so as to give the blows the surer chance, and so unprepared was I for such an attack, and with such fierce suddenness did she deliver it, that the first blow was near giving me my quietus.  But I grappled with the poor frantic creature as gently as might be--the stone of the wall separating us always--and stripped her of her weapon, and held her firmly captive till she might calm herself.  "That was an ungrateful blow," I said.  "But for my hand you'd have slipped and be the sport of a tiger's paw this minute."  "Oh, I must kill some one," she panted, "before I am killed myself."  "There will be time enough to think upon that some other day; but for now you are far enough off meeting further harm."  "You are lying to me.  You will throw me to the beasts as soon as I loose my grip.  I know your kind: you will not be robbed of your sport."  "I will go so far as to prove myself to you," said I, and called out for the warder who had tended the doors below.  "Bid those tigers be tethered on a shorter chain," I ordered, "and then go yourself outside into the circus, and help this lady delicately to the ground."  The word was passed and these things were done; and I too came out into the circus and joined the woman, who stood waiting under the moonlight.  But the others who had seen these doings were by no means suited at the change of plan.  One of the great stone valves of the farther door opened hurriedly, and a man strode out, armed and flushed.  "By all the Gods!" he shouted.  "Who comes between me and my pastime?"  I stepped quietly to the advance.  "I fear, sir," I said, "that you must launch your anger against me.  By accident I gave that woman sanctuary, and I had not heart to toss her back to your beasts."  His fingers began to snap against his hilt.  "You have come to the wrong market here with your qualms.  I am captain here, and my word carries, subject only to Phorenice's nod.  Do you hear that?  Do you know too that I can have you tossed to those striped gate-keepers of mine for meddling in here without an invitation?"  He looked at me sharp enough, but saw plainly that I was a stranger.  "But perhaps you carry a name, my man, which warrants your impertinence?"  "Deucalion is my poor name," I said, "but I cannot expect you will know it.  I am but newly landed here, sir, and when I left Atlantis some score of years back, a very different man to you held guard over these gates."  He had his forehead on my feet by this time.  "I had it from the Empress this night that she will to-morrow make a new sorting of this kingdom's dignities.  Perhaps there is some recommendation you would wish me to lay before her in return for your courtesies?"  "My lord," said the man, "if you wish it, I can have a turn with those cave-tigers myself now, and you can look on from behind the walls and see them tear me."  "Why tell me what is no news?"  "I wish to remind my lord of his power; I wish to beg of his clemency."  "You showed your power to these poor prisoners; but from what remains here to be seen, few of them have tasted much of your clemency."  "The orders were," said the captain of the gate, as though he thought a word might be said here for his defence, "the orders were, my lord, that the tigers should be kept fierce and accustomed to killing."  "Then, if you have obeyed orders, let me be the last to chide you.  But it is my pleasure that this woman be respited, and I wish now to question her."  The man got to his feet again with obvious relief, though still bowing low.  "Then if my lord will honour me by sitting in my room that overlooks the outer gate, the favour will never be forgotten."  "Show the way," I said, and took the woman by the fingers, leading her gently.  At the two ends of the circus the tigers prowled about on short chains, growling and muttering.  We passed through the door into the thickness of the outer wall, and the captain of the gate led us into his private chamber, a snug enough box overlooking the plain beyond the city.  He lit a torch from his lamp and thrust it into a bracket on the wall, and bowing deeply and walking backwards, left us alone, closing the door in place behind him.  He was an industrious fellow, this captain, to judge from the spoil with which his chamber was packed. There could have come very few traders in through that gate below  without his levying a private tribute; and so, judging that most of his goods had been unlawfully come by, I had little qualm at making a selection.  It was not decent that the woman, being an Atlantean, should go bereft of the dignity of clothes, as though she were a mere savage from Europe; and so I sought about amongst the captain's spoil for garments that would be befitting.  But, as I busied myself in this search for raiment, rummaging amongst the heaps and bales, with a hand and eye little skilled in such business, I heard a sound behind which caused me to turn my head, and there was the woman with a dagger she had picked from the floor, in the act of drawing it from the sheath.  She caught my eye and drew the weapon clear, but seeing that I made no advance towards her, or move to protect myself, waited where she was, and presently was took with a shuddering.  "Your designs seem somewhat of a riddle," I said.  "At first you wished to kill me from motives which you explained, and which I quite understood.  It lay in my power next to confer some small benefit upon you, in consequence of which you are here, and not--shall we say?--yonder in the circus.  Why you should desire now to kill the only man here who can set you completely free, and beyond these walls, is a thing it would gratify me much to learn.  I say nothing of the trifle of ingratitude.  Gratitude and ingratitude are of little weight here.  There is some far greater in your mind."  She pressed a hand hard against her breasts.  "You are Deucalion," she gasped; "I heard you say it."  "I am Deucalion.  So far, I have known no reason to feel shame for my name."  "And I come of those," she cried, with a rising voice, "who bite against this city, because they have found their fate too intolerable with the land as it is ordered now.  We heard of your coming from Yucatan.  It was we who sent the fleet to take you at the entrance to the Gulf."  "Your fleet gave us a pretty fight."  "Oh, I know, I know.  We had our watchers on the high land who brought us the tidings.  We had an omen even before that.  Where we lay with our army before the walls here, we saw great birds carrying off the slain to the mountains.  But where the fleet failed, I saw a chance where I, a woman, might--"  "Where you might succeed?"  I sat me down on a pile of the captain's stuffs.  It seemed as if here at last that I should find a solution for many things.  "You carry a name?"  I asked.  "They call me Nais."  "Ah," I said, and signed to her to take the clothes that I had sought out.  She was curiously like, so both my eyes and hearing said, to Ylga, the fan-girl of Phorenice, but as she had told me of no parentage I asked for none then.  Still her talk alone let me know that she was bred of none of the common people, and I made up my mind towards definite understanding.  "Nais," I said, "you wish to kill me.  At the same time I have no doubt you wish to live on yourself, if only to get credit from your people for what you have done.  So here I will make a contract with you.  Prove to me that my death is for Atlantis' good, and I swear by our Lord the Sun to go out with you beyond the walls, where you can stab me and then get you gone.  Or the--"  "I will not be your slave."  "I do not ask you for service.  Or else, I wished to say, I shall live so long as the High Gods wish, and do my poor best for this country.  And for you--I shall set you free to do your best also.  So now, I pray you, speak."    7.  THE BITERS OF THE WALLS (FURTHER ACCOUNT)   "You will set me free," she said, regarding me from under her brows, "without any further exactions or treaty?"  "I will set you free exactly on those terms," I answered, "unless indeed we here decide that it is better for Atlantis that I should die, in which case the freedom will be of your own taking."  "My lord plays a bold game."  "Tut, tut," I said.  "But I shall not hesitate to take the full of my bond, unless my theories are most clearly disproved to me."  "Tut," I said, "you women, how you can play out the time needlessly.  Show me sufficient cause, and you shall kill me where and how you please.  Come, begin the accusation."  "You are a tyrant."  "At least I have not paraded my tyrannies in Atlantis these twenty years.  Why, Nais, I did but land yesterday."  "You will not deny you came back from Yucatan for a purpose."  "I came back because I was sent for.  The Empress gives no reasons for her recalls.  She states her will; and we who serve her obey without question."  "Pah, I know that old dogma."  "If you discredit my poor honesty at the outset like this, I fear we shall not get far with our unravelling."  "My lord must be indeed simple," said this strange woman scornfully, "if he is ignorant of what all Atlantis knows."  "Then simple you must write me down.  Over yonder in Yucatan we were too well wrapped up in our own parochial needs and policies to have leisure to ponder much over the slim news which drifted out to us from Atlantis--and, in truth, little enough came.  By example, Phorenice (whose office be adored) is a great personage here at home; but over there in the colony we barely knew so much as her name.  Here, since I have been ashore, I have seen many new wonders; I have been carried by a riding mammoth; I have sat at a banquet; but in what new policies there are afoot, I have yet to be schooled."  "Then, if truly you do not know it, let me repeat to you the common tale.  Phorenice has tired of her unmated life."  "Stay there.  I will hear no word against the Empress."  "Pah, my lord, your scruples are most decorous.  But I did no more than repeat what the Empress had made public by proclamation.  She is minded to take to herself a husband, and nothing short of the best is good enough for Phorenice.  One after another has been put up in turn as favourite--and been found wanting.  Oh, I tell you, we here in Atlantis have watched her courtship with jumping hearts.  First it was this one here, then it was that one there; now it was this general just returned from a victory, and a day later he had been packed back to his camp, to give place to some dashing governor who had squeezed increased revenues from his province.  But every ship that came from the West said that there was a stronger man than any of these in Yucatan, and at last the Empress changed the wording of her vow.  'I'll have Deucalion for my husband,' said she, 'and then we will see who can stand against my wishes.'"  "The Empress (whose name be adored) can do as she pleases in such matters," I said guardedly; "but that is beside the argument.  I am here to know how it would be better for Atlantis that I should die?"  "You know you are the strongest man in the kingdom."  "It pleases you to say so."  "And Phorenice is the strongest woman."  "That is beyond doubt."  "Why, then, if the Empress takes you in marriage, we shall be under a double tyranny.  And her rule alone is more cruelly heavy than we can bear already."  "I pass no criticism on Phorenice's rule.  I have not seen it.  But I crave your mercy, Nais, on the newcomer into this kingdom.  I am strong, say you, and therefore I am a tyrant, say you.  Now to me this sequence is faulty."  "Who should a strong man use strength for, if not for himself?  And if for himself, why that spells tyranny.  You will get all your heart's desires, my lord, and you will forget that many a thousand of the common people will have to pay for them."  "And this is all your accusation?"  "It seems to be black enough.  I am one that has a compassion for my fellow-men, my lord, and because of that compassion you see me what I am to-day.  There was a time, not long passed, when I slept as soft and ate as dainty as any in Atlantis."  I smiled.  "Your speech told me that much from the first."  "Then I would I had cast the speech off, too, if that is also a livery of the tyrant's class.  But I tell you I saw all the oppression myself from the oppressor's side.  I was high in Phorenice's favour then."  "That, too, is easy of credence.  Ylga is the fan-girl to the Empress now, and second lady in the kingdom, and those who have seen Ylga could make an easy guess at the parentage of Nais."  "We were the daughters of one birth; but I do not count with either Zaemon or Ylga now.  Ylga is the creature of Phorenice, and Phorenice would have all the people of Atlantis slaves and in chains, so that she might crush them the easier.  And as for Zaemon, he is no friend of Phorenice's; he fights with brain and soul to drag the old authority to those on the Sacred Mountain; and that, if it come down on us again, would only be the exchange of one form of slavery for another."  "It seems to me you bite at all authority."  "In fact," she said simply, "I do.  I have seen too much of it."  "And so you think a rule of no-rule would be best for the country?"  "You have put it plainly in words for me.  That is my creed to-day.  That is the creed of all those yonder, who sit in the camp and besiege this city.  And we number on our side, now, all in Atlantis save those in the city and a handful on the priests' Mountain."  I shook my head.  "A creed of desperation, if you like, Nais, but, believe me, a silly creed.  Since man was born out of the quakings and the fevers of this earth, and picked his way amongst the cooler-places, he has been dependent always on his fellow-men.  And where two are congregated together, one must be chief, and order how matters are to be governed--at least, I speak of men who have a wish to be higher than the beasts.  Have you ever set foot in Europe?"  "No."  "I have.  Years back I sailed there, gathering slaves.  What did I see?  A country without rule or order.  Tyrants they were, to be sure, but they were the beasts.  The men and the women were the rudest savages, knowing nothing of the arts, dressing in skins and uncleanness, harbouring in caves and the tree-tops.  The beasts roamed about where they would, and hunted them unchecked."  "Still, they fought you for their liberty?"  "Never once.  They knew how disastrous was their masterless freedom.  Even to their dull, savage brains it was a sure thing that no slavery could be worse; and to that state you, and your friends, and your theories, will reduce Atlantis, if you get the upper hand.  But, then, to argue in a circle, you will never get it.  For to conquer, you must set up leaders, and once you have set them up, you will never pull them down again."  "Aye," she said with a sigh, "there is truth in that last."  The torch had filled the captain's room with a resinous smoke, but the flame was growing pale.  Dawn was coming in greyly through a slender arrow-slit, and with it ever and again the glow from some mountain out of sight, which was shooting forth spasmodic bursts of fire.  With it also were mutterings of distant falling rocks, and sullen tremblings, which had endured all the night through, and I judged that earth was in one of her quaking moods, and would probably during the forthcoming day offer us some chastening discomforts.  On this account, perhaps, my senses were stilled to certain evidences which would otherwise have given me a suspicion; and also, there is no denying that my general wakefulness was sapped by another matter.  This woman, Nais, interested me vastly out of the common; the mere presence of her seemed to warm the organs of my interior; and whilst she was there, all my thoughts and senses were present in the room of the captain of the gate in which we sat.  But of a sudden the floor of the chamber rocked and fell away beneath me, and in a tumult of dust, and litter, and bales of the captain's plunder, I fell down (still seated on the flagstone) into a pit which had been digged beneath it.  With the violence of the descent, and the flutter of all these articles about my head, I was in no condition for immediate action; and whilst I was still half-stunned by the shock, and long before I could get my eyes into service again, I had been seized, and bound, and half-strangled with a noose of hide.  Voices were raised that I should be despatched at once out of the way; but one in authority cried out that, killing me at leisure, and as a prisoner, promised more genteel sport; and so I was thrust down on the floor, whilst a whole army of men trod in over me to the attack.  What had happened was clear to me now, though I was powerless to do anything in hindrance.  The rebels with more craft than any one had credited to them, had driven a galley from their camp under the ground, intending so to make an entrance into the heart of the city.  In their clumsy ignorance, and having no one of sufficient talent in mensuration, they had bungled sadly both in direction and length, and so had ended their burrow under this chamber of the captain of the gate.  The great flagstone in its fall had, it appeared, crushed four of them to death, but these were little noticed or lamented.  Life was to them a bauble of the slenderest price, and a horde of others pressed through the opening, lusting for the fight, and recking nothing of their risks and perils.  Half-choked by the foul air of the galley, and trodden on by this great procession of feet, it was little enough I could do to help my immediate self much less the more distant city.  But when the chief mass of the attackers had passed through, and there came only here and there one eager to take his share at storming the gate, a couple of fellows plucked me up out of the mud on the floor, and began dragging me down through the stinking darkness of the galley towards the pit that gave it entrance.  Twenty times we were jostled by others hastening to the attack, either from hunger for fight, or from appetite for what they could steal.  But we came to the open at last, and half-suffocated though I was, I contrived to do obeisance, and say aloud the prescribed prayer to the most High Gods in gratitude for the fresh, sweet air which They had provided.  Our Lord the Sun was on the verge of rising for His day, and all things were plainly shown.  Before me were the monstrous walls of the capital, with the heads of its pyramids and higher buildings showing above them.  And on the walls, the sentries walked calmly their appointed paces, or took shelter against arrows in the casemates provided for them.  The din of fighting within the gate rose high into the air, and the heavy roaring of the cave-tigers told that they too were taking their share of the melee.  But the massive stonework of the walls hid all the actual engagement from our view, and which party was getting the upper hand we could not even guess.  But the sounds told how tight a fight was being hammered out in those narrow boundaries, and my veins tingled to be once more back at the old trade, and to be doing my share.  But there was no chivalry about the fellows who held me by my bonds.  They thrust me into a small temple near  by, which once had been a fane in much favour with travellers, who wished to show gratitude for the safe journey to the capital, but which now was robbed and ruined, and they swung to the stone entrance gate and barred it, leaving me to commune with myself.  Presently, they told me, I should be put to death by torments.  Well, this seemed to be the new custom of Atlantis, and I should have to endure it as best I could.  The High Gods, it appeared, had no further use for my services in Atlantis, and I was not in the mood then to bite very much at their decision.  What I had seen of the country since my return had not enamoured me very much with its new conditions.  The little temple in which I was gaoled had been robbed and despoiled of all its furnishments.  But the light-slits, where at certain hours of the day the rays of our Lord the Sun had fallen upon the image of the God, before this had been taken away, gave me vantage places from which I could see over the camp of these rebel besiegers, and a dreary prospect it was.  The people seemed to have shucked off the culture of centuries in as many months, and to have gone back for the most part to sheer brutishness.  The majority harboured on the bare ground.  Few owned shelter, and these were merely bowers of mud and branches.  They fought and quarrelled amongst themselves for food, eating their meat raw, and their grain (when they had it) unground.  Many who passed my vision I saw were even gnawing the soft inside of tree bark.  The dead lay where they fell.  The sick and the wounded found no hand to tend them.  Great man-eating birds hovered about the camp or skulked about, heavy with gorging, amongst the hovels, and no one had public spirit enough to give them battle.  The stink of the place rose up to heaven as a foul incense inviting a pestilence.  There was no order, no trace of strong command anywhere.  With three hundred well-disciplined troops it seemed to me that I could have sent those poor desperate hordes flying in panic to the forest.  However, there was no very lengthy space of time granted me for thinking out the policy of this matter to any great depth.  The attack on the gate had been delivered with suddenness; the repulse was not slow.  Of what desperate fighting took place in the galleries, and in the circus between the two sets of gates, the detail will never be told in full.  At the first alarm the great cave-tigers were set loose, and these raged impartially against keeper and foe.  Of those that went in through the tunnel, not one in ten returned, and there were few of these but what carried a bloody wound.  Some, with the ruling passion still strong in them, bore back plunder; one trailed along with him the head of the captain of the gate; and amongst them they dragged out two of the warders who were wounded, and whom revenge had urged them to take as prisoners.  Over these two last a hubbub now arose, that seemed likely to boil over into blows.  Every voice shouted out for them what he thought the most repulsive fate.  Some were for burning, some for skinning, some for impaling, some for other things: my flesh crept as I heard their ravenous yells.  Those that had been to the trouble of making them captive were still breathless from the fight, and were readily thrust aside; and it seemed to me that the poor wretches would be hustled into death before any definite fate was agreed upon, which all would pass as sufficiently terrific.  Never had I seen such a disorderly tumult, never such a leaderless mob.  But, as always has happened, and always will, the stronger men by dint of louder voices and more vigorous shoulders got their plans agreed to at last, and the others perforce had to give way.  A band of them set off running, and presently returned at snails' pace, dragging with them (with many squeals from ungreased wheels) one of those huge war engines with which besiegers are wont to throw great stones and other missiles into the cities they sit down against.  They ran it up just beyond bowshot of the walls, and clamped it firmly down with stakes and ropes to the earth.  Then setting their lean arms to the windlasses, they drew back the great tree which formed the spring till its tethering place reached the ground, and in the cradle at its head they placed one of the prisoners, bound helplessly, so that he could not throw himself over the side.  Then the rude, savage, skin-clad mob stood back, and one who had appointed himself engineer knocked back the catch that held the great spring in place.  With a whir and a twang the elastic wood flung upwards, and the bound man was shot away from its tip with the speed of a lightning flash.  He sang through the air, spinning over and over with inconceivable rapidity, and the great crowd of rebels held their breath in silence as they watched.  He passed high above the city wall, a tiny mannikin in the distance now, and then the trajectory of his flight began to lower.  The spike of a new-built pyramid lay in the path of his terrific flight, and he struck it with a thud whose sound floated out to us afterwards, and then he toppled down out of our sight, leaving a red stain on the whiteness of the stone as he fell.  With a roar the crowd acknowledged the success of their device, and bellowed out insults to Phorenice, and insults to the Gods: a poor frantic crowd they showed themselves.  And then with ravening shouts, they fell upon the other captive warder, binding him also into a compact helpless missile, and meanwhile getting the engine in gear again for another shot.  But for my part I saw nothing of this disgusting scene.  I heard the bolt grate stealthily against the door of the little temple in which I was imprisoned, and was minded to give these brutish rebels somewhat of a surprise.  I had rid myself of my bonds handily enough; I had rubbed my limbs to that perfect suppleness which is always desirable before a fight; and I had planned to rush out so soon as the door was swung, and kill those that came first with fist blows on the brow and chin.  They had not suspected my name, it was clear, for my stature and garb were nothing out of the ordinary; but if my bodily strength and fighting power had been sufficient to raise me to a vice-royalty like that of Yucatan, and let me endure alive in that government throughout twenty hard-battling years, why, it was likely that this rabble of savages would see something that was new and admirable in the practice of arms before the crude weight of their numbers could drag me down.  Nay, I did not even despair of winning free altogether.  I must find me a weapon from those that came up to battle, with which I could write worthy signatures, and I must attempt no standing fights.  Gods! but what a glow the prospect did send through me as I stood there waiting.  A vainer man, writing history, might have said that always, before everything else, he held in mind the greater interests before the less.  But for me--I prefer to be honest, and own myself human.  In my glee at that forthcoming fight--which promised to be the greatest and most furious I had known in all a long life of battling--I will confess that Atlantis and her differing policies were clean forgot.  I should go out an unknown man from the little cell of a temple, I should do my work, and then, whether I took freedom with me, or whether I came down at last myself on a pile of slain, these people would guess without being told the name, that here was Deucalion.  Gods! what a fight we would have made!  But the door did not open wide to give me space for my first rush.  It creaked gratingly outwards on its pivots, and a slim hand and a white arm slipped inside, beckoning me to quietude.  Here was some woman.  The door creaked wider, and she came inside.  "Nais," I said.  "Silence, or they will hear you, and remember.  At present those who brought you here are killed, and unless by chance some one blunders into this robbed shrine, you will not be found."  "Then, if that is so, let me go out and walk amongst these people as one of themselves."  She shook her head.  "But, Nais, I am not known here.  I am merely a man in very plain and mud-stained robe.  I should be in no ways remarkable."  A smile twitched her face.  "My lord," she said, "wears no beard; and his is the only clean chin in the camp."  I joined in her laugh.  "A pest on my want of foppishness then.  But I am forgetting somewhat.  It comes to my mind that we still have unfinished that small discussion of ours concerning the length of my poor life.  Have you decided to cut it off from risk of further mischief, or do you propose to give me further span?"  She turned to me with a look of sharp distress.  "My lord," she said, "I would have you forget that silly talk of mine.  This last two hours I thought you were dead in real truth."  "And you were not relieved?"  "I felt that the only man was gone out of the world--I mean, my lord, the only man who can save Atlantis."  "Your words give me a confidence.  Then you would have me go back and become husband to Phorenice?"  "If there is no other way."  "I warn you I shall do that, if she still so desires it, and if it seems to me that that course will be best.  This is no hour for private likings or dislikings."  "I know it," she said, "I feel it.  I have no heart now, save only for Atlantis.  I have schooled myself once more to that."  "And at present I am in this lone little box of a temple.  A minute ago, before you came, I had promised myself a pretty enough fight to signalise my changing of abode."  "There must be nothing of that.  I will not have these poor people slaughtered unnecessarily.  Nor do I wish to see my lord exposed to a hopeless risk.  This poor place, such as it is, has been given to me as an abode, and, if my lord can remain decorously till nightfall in a maiden's chamber, he may at least be sure of quietude.  I am a person," she added simply, "that in this camp has some respect.  When darkness comes, I will take my lord down to the sea and a boat, and so he may come with ease to the harbour and the watergate."    8.  THE PREACHER FROM THE MOUNTAINS   It was long enough since I had found leisure for a parcel of sleep, and so during the larger part of that day I am free to confess that I slumbered soundly, Nais watching me.  Night fell, and still we remained within the privacy of the temple.  It was our plan that I should stay there till the camp slept, and so I should have more chance of reaching the sea without disturbance.  The night came down wet, with a drizzle of rain, and through the slits in the temple walls we could see the many fires in the camp well cared for, the men and women in skins and rags toasting before them, with steam rising as the heat fought with their wetness.  Folk seated in discomfort like this are proverbially alert and cruel in the temper, and Nais frowned as she looked on the inclemency of the weather.  "A fine night," she said, "and I would have sent my lord back to the city without a soul here being the wiser; but in this chill, people sleep sourly.  We must wait till the hour drugs them sounder."  And so we waited, sitting there together on that pavement so long unkissed by worshippers, and it was little enough we said aloud.  But there can be good companionship without sentences of talk.  But as the hours drew on, the night began to grow less quiet.  From the distance some one began to blow on a horn or a shell, sending forth a harsh raucous note incessantly.  The sound came nearer, as we could tell from its growing loudness, and the voices of those by the fires made themselves heard, railing at the blower for his disturbance.  And presently it became stationary, and standing up we could see through the slits in the walls the people of the camp rousing up from their uneasy rest, and clustering together round one who stood and talked to them from the pedestal of a war engine.  What he was declaiming upon we could not hear, and our curiosity on the matter was not keen.  Given that all who did not sleep went to weary themselves with this fellow, as Nais whispered, it would be simple for me to make an exit in the opposite direction.  But here we were reckoning without the inevitable busybody.  A dozen pairs of feet splashing through the wet came up to the side of the little temple, and cried loudly that Nais should join the audience.  She had eloquence of tongue, it appeared, and they feared lest this speaker who had taken his stand on the war engine should make schisms amongst their ranks unless some skilled person stood up also to refute his arguments.  Here, then, it seemed to me that I must be elbowed into my skirmish by the most unexpected of chances, but Nais was firmly minded that there should be no fight, if courage on her part could turn it.  "Come out with me," she whispered, "and keep distant from the light of the fires."  "But how explain my being here?"  "There is no reason to explain anything," she said bitterly.  "They will take you for my lover.  There is nothing remarkable in that: it is the mode here.  But oh, why did not the Gods make you wear a beard, and curl it, even as other men?  Then you could have been gone and safe these two hours."  "A smooth chin pleases me better."  "So it does me," I heard her murmur as she leaned her weight on the stone which hung in the doorway, and pushed it ajar; "your chin."  The ragged men outside--there were women with them also--did not wait to watch me very closely.  A coarse jest or two flew (which I could have found good heart to have repaid with a sword-thrust) and they stepped off into the darkness, just turning from time to time to make sure we followed.  On all sides others were pressing in the same direction--black shadows against the night; the rain spat noisily on the camp fires as we passed them; and from behind us came up others.  There were no sleepers in the camp now; all were pressing on to hear this preacher who stood on the pedestal of the war engine; and if we had tried to swerve from the straight course, we should have been marked at once.  So we held on through the darkness, and presently came within earshot.  Still it was little enough of the preacher's words we could make out at first.  "Who are your chiefs?" came the question at the end of a fervid harangue, and immediately all further rational talk was drowned in uproar.  "We have no chiefs," the people shouted, "we are done with chiefs; we are all equal here.  Take away your silly magic.  You may kill us with magic if you choose, but rule us you shall not.  Nor shall the other priests rule.  Nor Phorenice.  Nor anybody.  We are done with rulers."  The press had brought us closer and closer to the man who stood on the war engine.  We saw him to be old, with white hair that tumbled on his shoulders, and a long white beard, untrimmed and uncurled.  Save for a wisp of rag about the loins, his body was unclothed, and glistened in the wet.  But in his hand he held that which marked his caste.  With it he pointed his sentences, and at times he whirled it about bathing his wet, naked body in a halo of light.  It was a wand whose tip burned with an unconsuming fire, which glowed and twinkled and blazed like some star sent down by the Gods from their own place in the high heaven.  It was the Symbol of our Lord the Sun, a credential no one could forge, and one on which no civilised man would cast a doubt.  Indeed, the ragged frantic crew did not question for one moment that he was a member of the Clan of Priests, the Clan which from time out of numbering had given rulers for the land, and even in their loudest clamours they freely acknowledged his powers.  "You may kill us with your magic, if you choose," they screamed at him.  But stubbornly they refused to come back to their old allegiance.  "We have suffered too many things these later years," they cried.  "We are done with rulers now for always."  But for myself I saw the old man with a different emotion.  Here was Zaemon that was father to Nais, Zaemon that had seen me yesterday seated on the divan at Phorenice's elbow, and who to-day could denounce me as Deucalion if so he chose.  These rebels had expended a navy in their wish to kill me four days earlier, and if they knew of my nearness, even though Nais were my advocate, her cold reasoning would have had little chance of an audience now.  The High Gods who keep the tether of our lives hide Their secrets well, but I did not think it impious to be sure that mine was very near the cutting then.  The beautiful woman saw this too.  She even went so far as to twine her fingers in mine and press them as a farewell, and I pressed hers in return, for I was sorry enough not to see her more.  Still I could not help letting my thoughts travel with a grim gloating over the fine mound of dead I should build before these ragged, unskilled rebels pulled me down.  And it was inevitable this should be so.  For of all the emotions that can ferment in the human heart, the joy of strife is keenest, and none but an old fighter, face to face with what must necessarily be his final battle, can tell how deep this lust is embroidered into the very foundations of his being.  But for the time Zaemon did not see me, being too much wrapped in his outcry, and so I was free to listen to the burning words which he spread around him, and to determine their effect on the hearers.  The theme he preached was no new one.  He told that ever since the beginning of history, the Gods had set apart one Clan of the people to rule over the rest and be their Priests, and until the coming of Phorenice these had done their duties with exactitude and justice.  They had fought invaders, carried war against the beasts, and studied earth-movements so that they were able to foretell earthquakes and eruptions, and could spread warnings that the people might be able to escape their devastations.  They are no self-seekers; their aim was always to further the interest of Atlantis, and so do honour to the kingdom on which the High Gods had set their special favour.  Under the Priestly Clan, Atlantis had reached the pinnacle of human prosperity and happiness.  "But," cried the old man, waving the Symbol till his wet body glistened in a halo of light, "the people grew fat and careless with their easy life.  They began to have a conceit that their good fortune was earned by their own puny brains and thews, and was no gift from the Gods above; and presently the cult of these Gods became neglected, and Their temples were barren of gifts and worshippers.  Followed a punishment.  The Gods in Their inscrutable way decreed that a wife of one of the Priests (that was a governor of no inconsiderable province) should see a woman child by the wayside, and take it for adoption.  That child the Gods in their infinite wisdom fashioned into a scourge for Atlantis, and you who have felt the weight of Phorenice's hand, know with what completeness the High Gods can fashion their instruments.  "Yet, even as they set up, so can they throw down, and those that shall debase Phorenice are even now appointed.  The old rule is to be re-established; but not till you who have sinned are sufficiently chastened to cry to it for relief."  He waved the mysterious glowing Symbol before him.  "See," he cried in his high old quavering voice, "you know the unspeakable Power of which that is the sign, and for which I am the mouthpiece.  It is for you to make decision now.  Are the Gods to throw down this woman who has scorned Them and so cruelly trodden on you?  Or are you to be still further purged of your pride before you are ripe for deliverance?"  The old priest broke off with a gesture, and his ragged white beard sank on to his chest.  Promptly a young man, skin clad and carrying his weapon, elbowed up through the press of listeners, and jumped on to the platform beside him.  "Hear me, brethren!" he bellowed, in his strong young voice.  "We are done with tyrants.  Death may come, and we all of us here have shown how little we fear it.  But own rulers again we will not, and that is our final say.  My lord," he said, turning to the old man with a brave face, "I know it is in your power to kill me by magic if you choose, but I have said my say, and can stand the cost if needs be."  "I can kill you, but I will not," said Zaemon.  "You have said your silliness.  Now go you to the ground again."  "We have free speech here.  I will not go till I choose."  "Aye, but you will," said the old man, and turned on him with a sudden tightening of the brows.  There was no blow passed; even the Symbol, which glowed like a star against the night, was not so much as lifted in warning; but the young man tried to retort, and, finding himself smitten with a sudden dumbness, turned with a spasm of fear, and jumped back whence he had come.  The crowd of them thrilled expectantly, and when no further portent was given, they began to shout that a miracle should be shown them, and then perchance they would be persuaded back to the old allegiance.  The old man stooped and glowered at them in fury.  "You dogs," he cried, "you empty-witted dogs!  Do you ask that I should degrade the powers of the Higher Mysteries by dancing them out before you as though they were a mummers' show?  Do you tickle yourselves that you are to be tempted back to your allegiance?  It is for you to woo the Gods who are so offended.  Come in humility, and I take it upon myself to declare that you will receive fitting pardon and relief.  Remain stubborn, and the scourge, Phorenice, may torment you into annihilation before she in turn is made to answer for the evil she has put upon the land.  There is the choice for you to pick at."  The turmoil of voices rose again into the wetness of the night, and weapons were upraised menacingly.  It was clear that the party for independence had by far the greater weight, both in numbers and lustiness; and those who might, from sheer weariness of strife, have been willing for surrender, withheld their word through terror of the consequence.  It was a fine comment on the freedom of speech, about which these unruly fools had made their boast, and, with a sly malice, I could not help whispering a word on this to Nais as she stood at my elbow.  But Nais clutched at my hand, and implored me for caution.  "Oh, be silent, my lord," she whispered back, "or they will tear you in pieces.  They are on fire for mischief now."  "Yet a few hours back you were for killing me yourself," I could not help reminding her.  She turned on me with a hot look.  "A woman can change her mind, my lord.  But it becomes you little to remind her of her fickleness."  A man in the press beside me wrenched round with an effort, and stared at me searchingly through the darkness.  "Oh!" he said.  "A shaved chin.  Who are you, friend, that you should cut a beard instead of curling it?  I can see no wound on your face."  I answered him civilly enough that, with "freedom" for a watchword, the fashion of my chin was a matter of mere private concern.  But as that did not satisfy him, and as he seemed to be one of those quarrelsome fellows that are the bane of every community, I took him suddenly by the throat and the shoulder, and bent his neck with the old, quick turn till I heard it crack, and had unhanded him before any of his neighbours had seen what had befallen.  The fierce press of the crowd held him from slipping to the ground, and so he stood on there where he was, with his head nodded forward, as though he had fallen asleep through heaviness, or had fainted through the crushing of his fellows.  I had no desire to begin that last fight of mine in a place like this, where there was no room to swing a weapon, nor chance to clear a battle ring.  But all this time the lean preacher from the mountains was sending forth his angry anathemas, and still holding the strained attention of the people.  And next he set forth before them the cult of the Gods in the ancient form as is prescribed, and they (with old habit coming back to them) made response in the words and in the places where the old ritual enjoins.  It was weird enough sight, that time-honoured service of adoration, forced upon these wild people after so long a period of irreligion.  They warmed to the old words as the high shrill voice of the priest cried them forth, and as they listened, and as they realised how intimate was the care of the Gods for the travails and sorrows of their daily lives, so much warmer grew their responses.  ". . . WHO STILLED THE BURNING OF THE MOUNTAINS, AND MADE COOL PLACES ON THE EARTH FOR US TO LIVE!--PRAISE TO THE MOST HIGH GODS.  "WHO GAVE US MASTERY OVER THE LESSER BEASTS AND SKILL OF TEN TIMES TO PREVAIL!--PRAISE TO THE MOST HIGH GODS. . . ."  "WHO GAVE US MASTERY OVER THE LESSER BEASTS AND SKILL OF TEN TIMES TO PREVAIL!--PRAISE TO THE MOST HIGH GODS . . . ."  It thrilled one to hear their earnestness; it sorrowed one to know that they would yet be obdurate and not return to their old allegiance.  For this is the way with these common people; they will work up an enthusiasm one minute, and an hour later it will have fled away and left them cold and empty.  But Zaemon made no further calls upon their loyalty.  He finished the prescribed form of sentences, and stepped down off the platform of the war engine with the Symbol of our Lord the Sun thrust out resolutely before him.  To all ordinary seeming the crowd had been packed so that no further compression was possible, but before the advance of the Symbol the people crushed back, leaving a wide lane for his passage.  And here came the turning point of my life.  At first, like, I take it, every one else in that crowd, I imagined that the old man, having finished his mission, was making a way to return to the place from which he had come.  But he held steadily to one direction, and as that was towards myself, it naturally came to my mind that, having dealt with greater things, he would now settle with the less; or, in plainer words, that having put his policy before the swarming people, he would now smite down the man he had seen but yesterday seated as Phorenice's minister.  Well, I should lose that final fight I had promised myself, and that mound of slain for my funeral bed.  It was clear that Zaemon was the mouthpiece of the Priests' Clan, duly appointed; and I also was a priest.  If the word had been given on the Sacred Mountain to those who sat before the Ark of the Mysteries that Atlantis would prosper more with Deucalion sent to the Gods, I was ready to bow to the sentence with submissiveness.  That I had regret for this mode of cutting off, I will not deny.  No man who has practised the game of arms could abandon the promise of such a gorgeous final battle without a qualm of longing.  But I had been trained enough to show none of these emotions on my face, and when the old man came up to me, I stood my ground and gave him the salutation prescribed between our ranks, which he returned to me with circumstance and accuracy.  The crowd fell back, being driven away by the ineffable force of the Symbol, leaving us alone in the middle of a ring.  Even Nais, though she was a priest's daughter, was ignorant of the Mysteries, and could not withstand its force.  And so we two men stood there alone together, with the glow of the Symbol bathing us, and lighting up the sea of ravenous faces that watched.  The people were quick to put their natural explanation on the scene.  "A spy!" they began to roar out.  "A spy!  Zaemon salutes him as a Priest!"  Zaemon faced round on them with a queer look on his grim old face.  "Aye," he said, "this is a Priest.  If I give you his name, you might have further interest.  This is the Lord Deucalion."  The word was picked up and yelled amongst them with a thousand emotions.  But at least they were loyal to their policy; they had decided that Deucalion was their enemy; they had already expended a navy for his destruction; and now that he was ringed in by their masses, they lusted to tear him into rags with their fingers.  But rave and rave though they might against me, the glare from the Symbol drove them shuddering back as though it had been a lava-stream; and Zaemon was not the man to hand me over to their fury until he had delivered formal sentence as the emissary of our Clan on the Sacred Mount.  So the end was not to be yet.  The old man faced me and spoke in the sacred tongue, which the common people do not know.  "My brother," he said, "which have you come to serve, Deucalion or Atlantis?"  "Words are a poor thing to answer a question like that.  You will know all of my record.  According to the Law of the Priests, each ship from Yucatan will have carried home its sworn report to lay at the feet of their council, and before I went to that vice-royalty, what I did was written plain here on the face of Atlantis."  "We know your doings in the past, brother, and they have found approval.  You have governed well, and you have lived austerely.  You set up Atlantis for a mistress, and served her well; but then, you have had no Phorenice to tempt you into change and fickleness."  "You can send me where I shall see her no more, if you think me frail."  "Yes, and lose your usefulness.  No, brother, you are the last hope which this poor land has remaining.  All other human means that have been tried against Phorenice have failed.  You have returned from overseas for the final duel.  You are the strongest man we have, and you are our final champion.  If you fail, then only those terrible Powers which are locked within the Ark of the Mysteries remains to us, and though it is not lawful to speak even in this hidden tongue of their scope, you at least have full assurance of their potency."  I shrugged my shoulders.  "It seems that you would save time and pains if you threw me to these wolves of rebels, and let them end me here and now."  The old man frowned on me angrily.  "I am bidding you do your duty.  What reason have you for wishing to evade it?"  "I have in my memory the words you spoke in the pyramid, when you came in amongst the banqueters.  'PHORENICE,' was your cry, 'WHILST YOU ARE YET EMPRESS, YOU SHALL SEE THIS ROYAL PYRAMID, WHICH YOU HAVE POLLUTED WITH YOUR DEBAUCHERIES, TORN TIER FROM TIER, AND STONE FROM STONE, AND SCATTERED AS FEATHERS BEFORE A WIND.'  It seems that you foresee my defeat."  The old man shuddered.  "I cannot tell what she may force us to do.  I spoke then only what it was revealed to me must happen.  Perhaps when matters have reached that pass, she will repent and submit.  But in the meanwhile, before we use the more desperate weapons of the Gods, it is fitting that we should expend all human power remaining to us.  And so you must go, my brother, and play your part to the utmost."  "It is an order.  So I obey."  "You shall be at Phorenice's side again by the next dawn.  She has sent for you from Yucatan as a husband, and as one who (so she thinks, poor human conqueror) has the weight of arm necessary to prolong her tyrannies.  You are a Priest, brother, and you are a man of convincing tongue.  It will be your part to make her stubborn mind see the invincible power that can be loosed against her, to point out to her the utter hopelessness of prevailing against it."  "If it is ordered, I will do these things.  But there is little enough chance of success.  I have seen Phorenice, and can gauge her will.  There will be no turning her once she has made a decision.  Others have tried; you have tried yourself; all have failed."  "Words that were wasted on a maiden may go home to a wife.  You have been brought here to be her husband.  Well, take your place."  The order came to me with a pang.  I had given little enough heed to women through all of a busy life, though when I landed, the taking of Phorenice to wife would not have been very repugnant to me if policy had demanded it.  But the matters of the last two days had put things in a different shape.  I had seen two other women who had strangely attracted me, and one of these had stirred within me a tumult such as I had never felt before amongst my economies.  To lead Phorenice in marriage would mean a severance from this other woman eternally, and I ached as I thought of it.  But though these thoughts floated through my system and gave me harsh wrenches of pain, I did not thrust my puny likings before the command of the council of the Priests.  I bowed before Zaemon, and put his hand to my forehead.  "It is an order," I said.  "If our Lord the Sun gives me life, I will obey."  "Then let us begone from this place," said Zaemon, and took me by the arm and waved a way for us with the Symbol.  No further word did I have with Nais, fearing to embroil her with these rebels who clustered round, but I caught one hot glance from her eyes, and that had to suffice for farewell.  The dense ranks of the crowd opened, and we walked away between them scathless.  Fiercely though they lusted for my life, brimming with hate though they made their cries, no man dared to rush in and raise a hand against me.  Neither did they follow.  When we reached the outskirts of the crowd, and the ranks thinned, they had a mind, many of them, to surge along in our wake; but Zaemon whirled the Symbol back before their faces with a blaze of lurid light, and they fell to their knees, grovelling, and pressed on us no more.  The rain still fell, and in the light of the camp fires as we passed them, the wet gleamed on the old man's wasted body.  And far before us through the darkness loomed the vast bulk of the Sacred Mountain, with the ring of eternal fires encincturing its crest.  I sighed as I thought of the old peaceful days I had spent in its temple and groves.  But there was to be no more of that studious leisure now.  There was work to be done, work for Atlantis which did not brook delay.  And so when we had progressed far out into the waste, and there was none near to view (save only the most High Gods), we found the place where the passage was, whose entrance is known only to the Seven amongst the Priests; and there we parted, Zaemon to his hermitage in the dangerous lands, and I by this secret way back into the capital.    9.  PHORENICE, GODDESS   Now the passage, though its entrance had been cunningly hidden by man's artifice, was one of those veins in which the fiery blood of our mother, the Earth, had aforetime coursed.  Long years had passed since it carried lava streams, but the air in it was still warm and sulphurous, and there was no inducement to linger in transit.  I lit me a lamp which I found in an appointed niche, and walked briskly along my ways, coughing, and wishing heartily I had some of those simples which ease a throat that has a tendency to catarrh.  But, alas! all that packet of drugs which were my sole spoil from the vice-royalty of Yucatan were lost in the sea-fight with Dason's navy, and since landing in Atlantis there had been little enough time to think for the refinements of medicine.  The network of earth-veins branched prodigiously, and if any but one of us Seven Priests had found a way into its recesses by chance, he would have perished hopelessly in the windings, or have fallen into one of those pits which lead to the boil below.  But I carried the chart of the true course clearly in my head, remembering it from that old initiation of twenty years back, when, as an appointed viceroy, I was raised to the highest degree but one known to our Clan, and was given its secrets and working implements.  The way was long, the floor was monstrous uneven, and the air, as I have said, bad; and I knew that day would be far advanced before the signs told me that I had passed beneath the walls, and was well within the precincts of the city.  And here the vow of the Seven hampered my progress; for it is ordained that under no circumstances, whatever the stress, shall egress be made from this passage before mortal eye.  One branch after another did I try, but always found loiterers near the exits.  I had hoped to make my emergence by that path which came inside the royal pyramid.  But there was no chance of coming up unobserved here; the place was humming like a hive.  And so, too, with each of the five next outlets that I visited.  The city was agog with some strange excitement.  But I came at last to a temple of one of the lesser Gods, and stood behind the image for a while making observation.  The place was empty; nay, from the dust which robed all the floors and the seats of the worshippers, it had been empty long enough; so I moved all that was needful, stepped out, and closed all entry behind me.  A broom lay unnoticed on one of the pews, and with this I soon disguised all route of footmark, and took my way to the temple door.  It was shut, and priest though I was, the secret of its opening was beyond me.  Here was a pretty pass.  No one but the attendant priests of the temple could move the mechanism which closed and opened the massive stone which filled the doorway; and if all had gone out to attend this spectacle, whatever it might be, that was stirring the city, why there I should be no nearer enlargement than before.  There was no sound of life within the temple precincts; there were evidences of decay and disuse spread broadcast on every hand; but according to the ancient law there should be eternally one at least on watch in the priests' dwellings, so down the passages which led to them I made my way.  It would have surprised me little to have found even these deserted.  That the old order was changed I knew, but I was only then beginning to realise the ruthlessness with which it had been swept away, and how much it had given place to the new.  However, there can be some faithful men remaining even in an age of general apostasy, and on making my way to the door of the dwelling (which lay in the roof of the temple) I gave the call, and presently it was opened to me.  The man who stood before me, peering dully through the gloom, had at least remained constant to his vows, and I made the salutation before him with a feeling of respect.  His name was Ro, and I remembered him well.  We had passed through the sacred college together, and always he had been known as the dullard.  He had capacity for learning little of the cult of the Gods, less of the arts of ruling, less still of the handling of arms; and he had been appointed to some lowly office in this obscure temple, and had risen to being its second priest and one of its two custodians merely through the desertion of all his colleagues.  But it was not pleasant to think that a fool should remain true where cleverer men abandoned the old beliefs.  Ro did before me the greater obeisance.  He wore his beard curled in the prevailing fashion, but it was badly done.  His clothing was ill-fitting and unbrushed.  He always had been a slovenly fellow.  "The temple door is shut," he said, "and I only have the secret of its opening.  My lord comes here, therefore, by the secret way, and as one of the Seven.  I am my lord's servant."  "Then I ask this small service of you.  Tell me, what stirs the city?"  "That impious Phorenice has declared herself Goddess, and declares that she will light the sacrifice with her own divine fire.  She will do it, too.  She does everything.  But I wish the flames may burn her when she calls them down.  This new Empress is the bane of our Clan, Deucalion, these latter days.  The people neglect us; they bring no offerings; and now, since these rebels have been hammering at the walls, I might have gone hungry if I had not some small store of my own.  Oh, I tell you, the cult of the true Gods is well-nigh oozed quite out  of the land."  "My brother, it comes to my mind that the Priests of our Clan have been limp in their service to let these things come to pass."  "I suppose we have done our best.  At least, we did as we were taught.  But if the people will not come to hear your exhortations, and neglect to adore the God, what hold have you over their religion?  But I tell you, Deucalion, that the High Gods try our own faith hard.  Come into the dwelling here.  Look there on my bed."  I saw the shape of a man, untidily swathed in reddened bandages.  "This is all that is left of the poor priest that was my immediate superior in this cure.  It was his turn yesterday to celebrate the weekly sacrifice to our Lord the Sun with the circle of His great stones.  Faugh!  Deucalion, you should have seen how he was mangled when they brought him back to me here."  "Did the people rise on him?  Has it come to that?"  "The people stayed passive," said Ro bitterly, "what few of them had interest to attend; but our Lord the Sun saw fit to try His minister somewhat harshly.  The wood was laid; the sacrifice was disposed upon it according to the prescribed rites; the procession had been formed round the altar, and the drums and the trumpets were speaking forth, to let all men know that presently the smoke of their prayer would be wafted up towards Those that sit in the great places in the heavens.  But then, above the noise of the ceremonial, there came the rushing sound of wings, and from out of the sky there flew one of those great featherless man-eating birds, of a bigness such as seldom before has been seen."  "An arrow shot in the eye, or a long-shafted spear receives them best."  "Oh, all men know what they were taught as children, Deucalion; but these priests were unarmed, according to the rubric, which ordains that they shall intrust themselves completely to the guardianship of the High Gods during the hours of sacrifice.  The great bird swooped down, settling on the wood pyre, and attacked the sacrifice with beak and talon.  My poor superior here, still strong in his faith, called loudly on our Lord the Sun to lend power to his arm, and sprang up on the altar with naught but his teeth and his bare arms for weapons.  It may be that he expected a miracle--he has not spoke since, poor soul, in explanation--but all he met were blows from leathery wings, and rakings from talons which went near to disembowelling him.  The bird brushed him away as easily as we could sweep aside a fly, and there he lay bleeding on the pavement beside the altar, whilst the sacrifice was torn and eaten in the presence of all the people.  And then, when the bird was glutted, it flew away again to the mountains."  "And the people gave no help?"  "They cried out that the thing was a portent, that our Lord the Sun was a God no longer if He had not power or thought to guard His own sacrifice; and some cried that there was no God remaining now, and others would have it that there was a new God come to weigh on the country, which had chosen to take the form of a common man-eating bird.  But a few began to shout that Phorenice stood for all the Gods now in Atlantis, and that cry was taken up till the stones of the great circle rang with it.  Some may have made proclamations because they were convinced; many because the cry was new, and pleased them; but I am sure there were not a few who joined in because it was dangerous to leave such an outburst unwelcomed.  The Empress can be hard enough to those who neglect to give her adulation."  "The Empress is Empress," I said formally, "and her name carries respect.  It is not for us to question her doings."  "I am a priest," said Ro, "and I speak as I have been taught, and defend the Faith as I have been commanded.  Whether there is a Faith any longer, I am beginning to doubt.  But, anyway, it yields a poor enough livelihood nowadays.  There have been no offerings at this temple this five months past, and if I had not a few jars of corn put by, I might have starved for anything the pious of this city cared.  And I do not think that the affair of that sacrifice is likely to put new enthusiasm into our cold votaries."  "When did it happen?"  "Twenty hours ago.  To-day Phorenice conducts the sacrifice herself.  That has caused the stir you spoke about.  The city is in the throes of getting ready one of her pageants."  "Then I must ask you to open the temple doors and give me passage.  I must go and see this thing for myself."  "It is not for me to offer advice to one of the Seven," said Ro doubtfully.  "It is not."  "But they say that the Empress is not overpleased at your absence," he mumbled.  "I should not like harm to come in your way, Deucalion," he said aloud.  "The future is in the hands of the most High Gods, Ro, and I at least believe that They will deal out our fates to each of us as They in Their infinite wisdom see best, though you seem to have lost your faith.  And now I must be your debtor for a passage out through the doors.  Plagues! man, it is no use your holding out your hand to me.  I do not own a coin in all the world."  He mumbled something about "force of habit" as he led the way down towards the door, and I responded tartly enough about the unpleasantness of his begging customs.  "If it were not for your sort and your customs, the Priests' Clan would not be facing this crisis to-day."  "One must live," he grumbled, as he pressed his levers, and the massive stone in the doorway swung ajar.  "If you had been a more capable man, I might have seen the necessity," said I, and passed into the open and left him.  I could never bring myself to like Ro.  A motley crowd filled the street which ran past the front of this obscure temple, and all were hurrying one way.  With what I had been told, it did not take much art to guess that the great stone circle of our Lord the Sun was their mark, and it grieved me to think of how many venerable centuries that great fane had upreared before the weather and the earth tremors, without such profanation as it would witness to-day.  And also the thought occurred to me, "Was our Great Lord above drawing this woman on to her destruction?  Would He take some vast and final act of vengeance when she consummated her final sacrilege?"  But the crowd pressed on, thrilled and excited, and thinking little (as is a crowd's wont) on the deeper matters which lay beneath the bare spectacle.  From one quarter of the city walls the din of an attack from the besiegers made itself clearly heard from over the house, and the temples and the palaces intervening, but no one heeded it.  They had grown callous, these townsfolk, to the battering of rams, and the flight of fire-darts, and the other emotions of a bombardment.  Their nerves, their hunger, their desperation, were strung to such a pitch that little short of an actual storm could stir them into new excitement over the siege.  All were weaponed.  The naked carried arms in the hopes of meeting some one whom they could overcome and rob; those that had a possession walked ready to do a battle for its ownership.  There was no security, no trust; the lesson of civilisation had dropped away from these common people as mud is washed from the feet by rain, and in their new habits and their thoughts they had gone back to the grade from which savages like those of Europe have never yet emerged.  It was a grim commentary on the success of Phorenice's rule.  The crowd merged me into their ranks without question, and with them I pressed forward down the winding streets, once so clean and trim, now so foul and mud-strewn.  Men and women had died of hunger in these streets these latter years, and rotted where they lay, and we trod their bones underfoot as we walked.  Yet rising out of this squalor and this misery were great pyramids and palaces, the like of which for splendour and magnificence had never been seen before.  It was a jarring admixture.  In time we came to the open space in the centre of the city, which even Phorenice had not dared to encroach upon with her ambitious building schemes, and stood on the secular ground which surrounds the most ancient, the most grand, and the breast of all this world's temples.  Since the beginning of time, when man first emerged amongst the beasts, our Lord the Sun has always been his chiefest God, and legend says that He raised this circle of stones Himself to be a place where votaries should offer Him worship.  It is the fashion amongst us moderns not to take these old tales in a too literal sense, but for myself, this one satisfies me.  By our wits we can lift blocks weighing six hundred men, and set them as the capstones of our pyramids.  But to uprear the stones of that great circle would be beyond all our art, and much more would it be impossible to-day, to transport them from their distant quarries across the rugged mountains.  There were nine-and-forty of the stones, alternating with spaces, and set in an accurate circle, and across the tops of them other stones were set, equally huge.  The stones were undressed and rugged; but the huge massiveness of them impressed the eye more than all the temples and daintily tooled pyramids of our wondrous city.  And in the centre of the circle was that still greater stone which formed the altar, and round which was carved, in the rude chiselling of the ancients, the snake and the outstretched hand.  The crowd which bore me on came to a standstill before the circle of stones.  To trespass beyond this is death for the common people; and for myself, although I had the right of entrance, I chose to stay where I was for the present, unnoticed amongst the mob, and wait upon events.  For long enough we stood there, our Lord the Sun burning high and fiercely from the clear blue sky above our heads.  The din of the rebels' attack upon the walls came to us clearly, even above the gabble of the multitude, but no one gave attention to it.  Excitement about what was to befall in the circle mastered every other emotion.  I learned afterways that so pressing was the rebels' attack, and so destructive the battering of their new war engines, that Phorenice had gone off to the walls first to lend awhile her brilliant skill for its repulse, and to put heart into the defenders.  But as it was, the day had burned out to its middle and scorched us intolerably, before the noise of the drums and horns gave advertisement that the pageant had formed in procession; and of those who waited in the crowd, many had fainted with exhaustion and the heat, and not a few had died.  But life was cheap in the city of Atlantis now, and no one heeded the fallen.  Nearer and nearer drew the drums and the braying of the other music, and presently the head of a glittering procession began to arrive and dispose itself in the space which had been set apart.  Many a thousand poor starving wretches sighed when they saw the wanton splendour of it.  But these lords and these courtiers of this new Atlantis had no concern beyond their own bellies and their own backs, except for their one alien regard--their simpering affection for Phorenice.  I think, though, their loyalty for the Empress was real enough, and it was not to be wondered at, since everything they had came from her lavish hands.  Indeed, the woman had a charm that cannot be denied, for when she appeared, riding in the golden castle (where I also had ridden) on the back of her monstrous shaggy mammoth, the starved sullen faces of the crowd brightened as though a meal and sudden prosperity had been bestowed upon them; and without a word of command, without a trace of compulsion, they burst into spontaneous shouts of welcome.  She acknowledged it with a smile of thanks.  Her cheeks were a little flushed, her movements quick, her manner high-strung, as all well might be, seeing the horrible sacrilege she had in mind.  But she was undeniably lovely; yes, more adorably beautiful than ever with her present thrill of excitement; and when the stair was brought, and she walked down from the mammoth's back to the ground, those near fell to their knees and gave her worship, out of sheer fascination for her beauty and charm.  Ylga, the fan-girl, alone of all that vast multitude round the Sun temple contained herself with her formal paces and duties.  She looked pained and troubled.  It was plain to see, even from the distance where I stood, that she carried a heavy heart under the jewels of her robe.  It was fitting, too, that this should be so.  Though she had been long enough divorced from his care and fostered by the Empress, Ylga was a daughter of Zaemon, and he was the chiefest of our Lord the Sun's ministers here on earth.  She could not forget her upbringing now at this supreme moment when the highest of the old Gods was to be formally defied.  And perhaps also (having a kindness for Phorenice) she was not a little dreadful of the consequences.  But the Empress had no eye for one sad look amongst all that sea of glowing faces.  Boldly and proudly she strode out into the circle, as though she had been the duly appointed priest for the sacrifice.  And after her came a knot of men, dressed as priests, and bearing the victim.  Some of these were creatures of her own, and it was easy to forgive mere ignorant laymen, won over by the glamour of Phorenice's presence.  But some, to their shame, were men born in the Priests' Clan, and brought up in the groves and colleges of the Sacred Mountain, and for their apostasy there could be no palliation.  The wood had already been stacked on the altar-stone in the due form required by the ancient symbolism, and the Empress stood aside whilst those who followed did what was needful.  As they opened out, I saw that the victim was one of the small, cloven-hoofed horses that roam the plains--a most acceptable sacrifice.  They bound its feet with metal gyves, and put it on the pyre, where, for a while, it lay neighing.  Then they stepped aside, and left it living.  Here was an innovation.  The false priests went back to the farther side of the circle, and Phorenice stood alone before the altar.  She lifted up her voice, sweet, tuneful, and carrying, and though the din of the siege still came from over the city, no ear there lost a word of what was spoken.  She raised her glance aloft, and all other eyes followed it.  The heaven was clear as the deep sea, a gorgeous blue.  But as the words came from her, so a small mist was born in the sky, wheeling and circling like a ball, although the day was windless, and rapidly growing darker and more compact.  So dense had it become, that presently it threw a shadow on part of the sacred circle and soothed it into twilight, though all without where the people stood was still garish day.  And in the ball of mist were little quick stabs and splashes of noiseless flame.  She spoke, not in the priests' sacred tongue--though such was her wicked cleverness, that she may very well have learned it--but in the common speech of the people, so that all who heard might understand; and she told of her wondrous birth (as she chose to name it), and of the direct aid of the most High Gods, which had enabled her to work so many marvels.  And in the end she lifted both of her fair white arms towards the blackness above, and with her lovely face set with the strain of will, she uttered her final cry:  "O my high Father, the Sun, I pray You now to acknowledge me as Your very daughter.  Give this people a sign that I am indeed a child of the Gods and no frail mortal.  Here is sacrifice unlit, where mortal priests with their puny fires had weekly, since the foundation of this land, sent savoury smoke towards the sky.  I pray You send down the heavenly fire to burn this beast here offered, in token that though You still rule on high, You have given me Atlantis to be my kingdom, and the people of the Earth to be my worshippers."  She broke off and strained towards the sky.  Her face was contorted.  Her limbs shook.  "O mighty Father," she cried, "who hast made me a God and an equal, hear me!  Hear me!"  Out of the black cloud overhead there came a blinding flash of light, which spat downwards on to the altar.  The cloven-hoofed horse gave one shrill neigh, and one convulsion, and fell back dead.  Flames crackled out from the wood pile, and the air became rich with the smell of burning flesh.  And lo! in another moment the cloud above had melted into nothingness, and the flames burnt pale, and the smoke went up in a thin blue spiral towards the deeper blueness of the sky.  Phorenice, the Empress, stood there before the great stone, and before the snake and the outstretched hand of life which were inscribed upon it, flushed, exultant, and once more radiantly lovely; and the knot of priests within the circle, and the great mob of people without, fell to the ground adoring.  "Phorenice, Goddess!" they cried.  "Phorenice, Goddess of all Atlantis!"  But for myself I did not kneel.  I would have no part in this apostasy, so I stood there awaiting fate.     10.  A WOOING   A murmur quickly sprang up round me, which grew into shouts.  "Kneel," one whispered, "kneel, sir, or you will be seen."  And another cried: "Kneel, you without beard, and do obeisance to the only Goddess, or by the old Gods I will make myself her priest and butcher you!"  And so the shouts arose into a roar.  But presently the word "Deucalion" began to be bandied about, and there came a moderation in the zeal of these enthusiasts.  Deucalion, the man who had left Atlantis twenty years before to rule Yucatan, they might know little enough about, but Deucalion, who rode not many days back beside the Empress in the golden castle beneath the canopy of snakes, was a person they remembered; and when they weighed up his possible ability for vengeance, the shouts died away from them limply.  So when the silence had grown again, and Phorenice turned and saw me standing alone amongst all the prostrate worshippers, I stepped out from the crowd and passed between two of the great stones, and went across the circle to where she stood beside the altar.  I did not prostrate myself.  At the prescribed distance I made the salutation which she herself had ordered when she made me her chief minister, and then hailed her with formal decorum as Empress.  "Deucalion, man of ice," she retorted.  "I still adhere to the old Gods!"  "I was not referring to that," said she, and looked at me with a sidelong smile.  But here Ylga came up to us with a face that was white, and a hand that shook, and made supplication for my life.  "If he will not leave the old Gods yet," she pleaded, "surely you will pardon him?  He is a strong man, and does not become a convert easily.  You may change him later.  But think, Phorenice, he is Deucalion; and if you slay him here for this one thing, there is no other man within all the marches of Atlantis who would so worthily serve--"  The Empress took the words from her.  "You slut," she cried out.  "I have you near me to appoint my wardrobe, and carry my fan, and do you dare to put a meddling finger on my policies?  Back with you, outside this circle, or I'll have you whipped.  Ay, and I'll do more.  I'll serve you as Zaemon served my captain, Tarca.  Shall I point a finger at you, and smite your pretty skin with a sudden leprosy?"  The girl bowed her shoulders, and went away cowed, and Phorenice turned to me.  "My lord," she said, "I am like a young bird in the nest that has suddenly found its wings.  Wings have so many uses that I am curious to try them all."  "May each new flight they take be for the good of Atlantis."  "Oh," she said, with an eye-flash, "I know what you have most at heart.  But we will go back to the pyramid, and talk this out at more leisure.  I pray you now, my lord, conduct me back to my riding beast."  It appeared then that I was to be condoned for not offering her worship, and so putting public question on her deification.  It appeared also that Ylga's interference was looked upon as untimely, and, though I could not understand the exact reasons for either of these things, I accepted them as they were, seeing that they forwarded the scheme that Zaemon had bidden me carry out.  So when the Empress lent me her fingers--warm, delicate fingers they were, though so skilful to grasp the weapons of war--I took them gravely, and led her out of the great circle, which she had polluted with her trickeries.  I had expected to see our Lord the Sun take vengeance on the profanation whilst it was still in act; but none had come: and I knew that He would choose his own good time for retribution, and appoint what instrument He thought best, without my raising a puny arm to guard His mighty honour.  So I led this lovely sinful woman back to the huge red mammoth which stood there tamely in waiting, and the smell of the sacrifice came after us as we walked.  She mounted the stair to the golden castle on the shaggy beast's back, and bade me mount also and take seat beside her.  But the place of the fan-girl behind was empty, and what we said as we rode back through the streets there was none to overhear.  She was eager to know what had befallen me after the attack on the gate, and I told her the tale, laying stress on the worthiness of Nais, and uttering an opinion that with care the girl might be won back to allegiance again.  Only the commands that Zaemon laid upon me when he and I spoke together in the sacred tongue, did I withhold, as it is not lawful to repeat these matters save only in the High Council of the Priests itself as they sit before the Ark of the Mysteries.  "You seem to have an unusual kindliness for this rebel Nais," said Phorenice.  "She showed herself to me as more clever and thoughtful than the common herd."  "Ay," she answered, with a sigh that I think was real enough in its way, "an Empress loses much that meaner woman gets as her common due."  "In what particular?"  "She misses the honest wooing of her equals."  "If you set up for a Goddess--" I said.  "Pah!  I wish to be no Goddess to you, Deucalion.  That was for the common people; it gives me more power with them; it helps my schemes.  All you Seven higher priests know that trick of calling down the fire, and it pleased me to filch it.  Can you not be generous, and admit that a woman may be as clever in finding out these natural laws as your musty elder priests?"  "Remains that you are Empress."  "Nor Empress either.  Just think that there is a woman seated beside you on this cushion, Deucalion, and look upon her, and say what words come first to your lips.  Have done with ceremonies, and have done with statecraft.  Do you wish to wait on as you are till all your manhood withers?  It is well not to hurry unduly in these matters: I am with you there.  Yet, who but a fool watches a fruit grow ripe, and then leaves it till it is past its prime?"  I looked on her glorious beauty, but as I live it left me cold.  But I remembered the command that had been laid upon me, and forced a smile.  "I may have been fastidious," I said, "but I do not regret waiting this long."  "Nor I. But I have played my life as a maid, time enough.  I am a woman, ripe, and full-blooded, and the day has come when I should be more than what I have been."  I let my hand clench on hers.  "Take me to husband then, and I will be a good man to you.  But, as I am bidden speak to Phorenice the woman now, and not to the Empress, I offer fair warning that I will be no puppet."  She looked at me sidelong.  "I have been master so long that I think it will come as enjoyment to be mastered sometimes.  No, Deucalion, I promise that--you shall be no puppet.  Indeed, it would take a lusty lung to do the piping if you were to dance against your will."  "Then, as man and wife we will live together in the royal pyramid, and we will rule this country with all the wit that it has pleased the High Gods to bestow on us.  These miserable differences shall be swept aside; the rebels shall go back to their homes, and hunt, and fight the beasts in the provinces, and the Priests' Clan shall be pacified.  Phorenice, you and I will throw ourselves brain and soul into the government, and we will make Atlantis rise as a nation that shall once more surpass all the world for peace and prosperity."  Petulantly she drew her hand away from mine.  "oh, your conditions, and your Atlantis!  You carry a crudeness in these colonial manners of yours, Deucalion, that palls on one after the first blunt flavour has worn away.  Am I to do all the wooing?  Is there no thrill of love under all your ice?"  "In truth, I do not know what love may be.  I have had little enough speech with women all these busy years."  "We were a pair, then, when you landed, though I have heard sighs and protestations from every man that carries a beard in all Atlantis.  Some of them tickled my fancy for the day, but none of them have moved me deeper.  No, I also have not learned what this love may be from my own personal feelings.  But, sir, I think that you will teach me soon, if you go on with your coldness."  "From what I have seen, love is for the poor, and the weak, and for those of flighty emotions."  "Then I would that another woman were Empress, and that I were some ill-dressed creature of the gutter that a strong man could pick up by force, and carry away to his home for sheer passion.  Ah!  How I could revel in it!  How I could respond if he caught my whim!"  She laughed.  "But I should lead him a sad life of it if my liking were not so strong as his."  "We are as we are made, and we cannot change our inwards which move us."  She looked at me with a sullen glance.  "If I do not change yours, my Deucalion, there will be more trouble brewed for this poor Atlantis that you set such store upon.  There will be ill doings in this coming household of ours if my love grows for you, and yours remains still unborn."  I believe she would have had me fondle her there in the golden castle on the mammoth's shabby back, before the city streets packed with curious people.  She had little enough appetite for privacy at any time.  But for the life of me I could not do it.  The Gods know I was earnest enough about my task, and They know also how it repelled me.  But I was a true priest that day, and I had put away all personal liking to carry out the commands which the Council had laid upon me.  If I had known how to set about it, I would have fallen in with her mood.  But where any of those shallow bedizened triflers about the court would have been glibly in his element, I stuck for lack of a dozen words.  There was no help for it but to leave all, save what I actually felt, unsaid.  Diplomacy I was trained in, and on most matters I had a glib enough tongue.  But to palter with women was a lightness I had always neglected, and if I had invented would-be pretty speeches out of my clumsy inexperience, Phorenice would have seen through the fraud on the instant.  She had been nurtured during these years of her rule on a pap of these silly protestations, and could weigh their value with an expert's exactness.  Nor was it a case where honest confession would have served my purpose better.  If I had put my position to her in plain words, it would have made relations worse.  And so perforce I had to hold my tongue, and submit to be considered a clown.  "I had always heard," she said, "that you colonists in Yucatan were far ahead of those in Egypt in all the arts and graces.  But you, sir, do small credit to your vice-royalty.  Why, I have had gentry from the Nile come here, and you might almost think they had never left their native shores."  "They must have made great strides this last twenty years, then.  When last I was sent to Egypt to report, the blacks were clearly masters of the land, and our people lived there only on sufferance.  Their pyramids were puny, and their cities nothing more than forts."  "Oh," she said mockingly, "they are mere exiles still, but they remember their manners.  My poor face seemed to please them, at least they all went into raptures over it.  And for ten pleasant words, one of them cut off his own right hand.  We made the bargain, my Egyptian gallant and I, and the hand lies dried on some shelf in my apartment to-day as a pleasant memento."  But here, by a lucky chance for me, an incident occurred which saved me from further baiting.  The rebels outside the walls were conducting their day's attack with vigour and some intelligence.  More than once during our procession the lighter missiles from their war engines had sung up through the air, and split against a building, and thrown splinters which wounded those who thronged the streets.  Still there had been nothing to ruffle the nerves of any one at all used to the haps of warfare, or in any way to hinder our courtship.  But presently, it seems, they stopped hurling stones from their war engines, and took to loading them with carcases of wood lined with the throwing fire.  Now, against stone buildings these did little harm, save only that they scorched horribly any poor wretch that was within splash of them when they burst; but when they fell upon the rude wooden booths and rush shelters of the poorer folk, they set them ablaze instantly.  There was no putting out these fires.  These things also would have given to either Phorenice or myself little enough of concern, as they are the trivial and common incidents of every siege; but the mammoth on which we rode had not been so properly schooled.  When the first blue whiff of smoke came to us down the windings of the street, the huge red beast hoisted its trunk, and began to sway its head uneasily.  When the smoke drifts grew more dense, and here and there a tongue of flame showed pale beneath the sunshine, it stopped abruptly and began to trumpet.  The guards who led it, tugged manfully at the chains which hung from the jagged metal collar round its neck, so that the spikes ran deep into its flesh, and reminded it keenly of its bondage.  But the beast's terror at the fire, which was native to its constitution, mastered all its new-bought habits of obedience.  From time unknown men have hunted the mammoth in the savage ground, and the mammoth has hunted men; and the men have always used fire as a shield, and mammoths have learned to dread fire as the most dangerous of all enemies.  Phorenice's brow began to darken as the great beast grew more restive, and she shook her red curls viciously.  "Some one shall lose a head for this blundering," said she.  "I ordered to have this beast trained to stand indifferent to drums, shouting, arrows, stones, and fire, and the trainers assured me that all was done, and brought examples."  I slipped my girdle.  "Here," I said, "quick.  Let me lower you to the ground."  She turned on me with a gleam.  "Are you afraid for my neck, then, Deucalion?"  "I have no mind to be bereaved before I have tasted my wedded life."  "Pish!  There is little enough of danger.  I will stay and ride it out.  I am not one of your nervous women, sir.  But go you, if you please."  "There is little enough chance of that now."  Blood flowed from the mammoth's neck where the spikes of the collar tore it, and with each drop, so did the tameness seem to ooze out from it also.  With wild squeals and trumpetings it turned and charged viciously down the way it had come, scattering like straws the spearmen who tried to stop it, and mowing a great swath through the crowd with its monstrous progress.  Many must have been trodden under foot, many killed by its murderous trunk, but only their cries came to us.  The golden castle, with its canopy of royal snakes, was swayed and tossed, so that we two occupants had much ado not to be shot off like stones from a catapult.  But I took a brace with my feet against the front, and one arm around a pillar, and clapped the spare arm round Phorenice, so as to offer myself to her as a cushion.  She lay there contentedly enough, with her lovely face just beneath my chin, and the faint scent of her hair coming in to me with every breath I took; and the mammoth charged madly on through the narrow streets.  We had outstripped the taint of smoke, and the original cause of fear, but the beast seemed to have forgotten everything in its mad panic.  It held furiously on with enormous strides, carrying its trunk aloft, and deafening us with its screams and trumpetings.  We left behind us quickly all those who had trod in that glittering pageant, and we were carried helplessly on through the wards of the city.  The beast was utterly beyond all control.  So great was its pace that there was no alternative but to try and cling on to the castle.  Up there we were beyond its reach.  To have leapt off, even if we had avoided having brains dashed out or limbs smashed by the fall, would have been to put ourselves at once at a frightful disadvantage.  The mammoth would have scented us immediately, and turned (as is the custom of these beasts), and we should have been trampled into a pulp in a dozen seconds.  The thought came to me that here was the High God's answer to Phorenice's sacrilege.  The mammoth was appointed to carry out Their vengeance by dashing her to pieces, and I, their priest, was to be human witness that justice had been done.  But no direct revelation had been given me on this matter, and so I took no initiative, but hung on to the swaying castle, and held the Empress against bruises in my arms.  There was no guiding the brute: in its insanity of madness it doubled many times upon its course, the windings of the streets confusing it.  But by degrees we left the large palaces and pyramids behind, and got amongst the quarters of artisans, where weavers and smiths gaped at us from their doors as we thundered past.  And then we came upon the merchants' quarters where men live over their storehouses that do traffic with the people over seas, and then down an open space there glittered before us a mirror of water.  "Now here," thought I, "this mad beast will come to sudden stop, and as like as not will swerve round sharply and charge back again towards the heart of the city."  And I braced myself to withstand the shock, and took fresh grip upon the woman who lay against my breast.  But with louder screams and wilder trumpetings the mammoth held straight on, and presently came to the harbour's edge, and sent the spray sparkling in sheets amongst the sunshine as it went with its clumsy gait into the water.  But at this point the pace was very quickly slackened.  The great sewers, which science devised for the health of the city in the old King's time, vomit their drainings into this part of the harbour, and the solid matter which they carry is quickly deposited as an impalpable sludge.  Into this the huge beast began to sink deeper and deeper before it could halt in its rush, and when with frightened bellowings it had come to a stop, it was bogged irretrievably.  Madly it struggled, wildly it screamed and trumpeted.  The harbour-water and the slime were churned into one stinking compost, and the golden castle in which we clung lurched so wildly that we were torn from it and shot far away into the water.  Still there, of course, we were safe, and I was pleased enough to be rid of the bumpings.  Phorenice laughed as she swam.  "You handle yourself like a sore man, Deucalion.  I owe you something for lending me the cushion of your body.  By my face!  There's more of the gallant about you when it comes to the test than one would guess to hear you talk.  How did you like the ride, sir?  I warrant it came to you as a new experience."  "I'd liefer have walked."  "Pish, man!  You'll never be a courtier.  You should have sworn that with me in your arms you could have wished the bumping had gone on for ever.  Ho, the boat there!  Hold your arrows.  Deucalion, hail me those fools in that boat.  Tell them that, if they hurt so much as a hair of my mammoth, I'll kill them all by torture.  He'll exhaust himself directly, and when his flurry's done we'll leave him where he is to consider his evil ways for a day or so, and then haul him out with windlasses, and tame him afresh.  Pho!  I could not feel myself to be Phorenice, if I had no fine, red, shaggy mammoth to take me out for my rides."  The boat was a ten-slave galley which was churning up from the farther side of the harbour as hard as well-plied whips could make oars drive her, but at the sound of my shouts the soldiers on her foredeck stopped their arrowshots, and the steersman swerved her off on a new course to pick us up.  Till then we had been swimming leisurely across an angle of the harbour, so as to avoid landing where the sewers outpoured; but we stopped now, treading the water, and were helped over the side by most respectful hands.  The galley belonged to the captain of the port, a mincing figure of a mariner, whose highest appetite in life was to lick the feet of the great, and he began to fawn and prostrate himself at once, and to wish that his eyes had been blinded before he saw the Empress in such deadly peril.  "The peril may pass," said she.  "It's nothing mortal that will ever kill me.  But I have spoiled my pretty clothes, and shed a jewel or two, and that's annoying enough as you say, good man."  The silly fellow repeated a wish that he might be blinded before the Empress was ever put to such discomfort again.  But it seemed she could be cloyed with flattery.  "If you are tired of your eyes," said she, "let me tell you that you have gone the way to have them plucked out from their sockets.  Kill my mammoth, would you, because he has shown himself a trifle frolicsome?  You and your sort want more education, my man.  I shall have to teach you that port-captains and such small creatures are very easy to come by, and very small value when got, but that my mammoth is mine--mine, do you understand?--the property of Goddess Phorenice, and as such is sacred."  The port-captain abased himself before her.  "I am an ignorant fellow," said he, "and heaven was robbed of its brightest ornament when Phorenice came down to Atlantis.  But if reparation is permitted me, I have two prisoners in the cabin of the boat here who shall be sacrificed to the mammoth forthwith.  Doubtless it would please him to make sport with them, and spill out the last lees of his rage upon their bodies."  "Prisoners you've got, have you?  How taken?"  "Under cover of last night they were trying to pass in between the two forts which guard the harbour mouth.  But their boat fouled the chain, and by the light of the torches the sentries spied them.  They were caught with ropes, and put in a dungeon.  There is an order not to abuse prisoners before they have been brought before a judgment?"  "It was my order.  Did these prisoners offer to buy their lives with news?"  "The man has not spoken.  Indeed, I think he got his death-wound in being taken.  The woman fought like a cat also, so they said in the fort, but she was caught without hurt.  She says she has got nothing that would be of use to tell.  She says she has tired of living like a savage outside the city, and moreover that, inside, there is a man for whose nearness she craves most mightily."  "Tut!" said Phorenice.  "Is this a romance we have swum to?  You see what affectionate creatures we women are, Deucalion."--The galley was brought up against the royal quay and made fast to its golden rings.  I handed the Empress ashore, but she turned again and faced the boat, her garments still yielding up a slender drip of water.--"Produce your woman prisoner, master captain, and let us see whether she is a runaway wife, or a lovesick girl mad after her sweetheart.  Then I will deliver judgment on her, and as like as not will surprise you all with my clemency.  I am in a mood for tender romance to-day."  The port-captain went into the little hutch of a cabin with a white face.  It was plain that Phorenice's pleasantries scared him.  "The man appears to be dead, Your Majesty.  I see that his wounds--"  "Bring out the woman, you fool.  I asked for her.  Keep your carrion where it is."  I saw the fellow stoop for his knife to cut a lashing, and presently who should he bring out to the daylight but the girl I had saved from the cave-tigers in the circus, and who had so strangely drawn me to her during the hours that we had spent afterwards in companionship.  It was clear, too, that the Empress recognised her also.  Indeed, she made no secret about the matter, addressing her by name, and mockingly making inquiries about the menage of the rebels, and the success of the prisoner's amours.  "This good port-captain tells me that you made a most valiant attempt to return, Nais, and for an excuse you told that it was your love for some man in the city here which drew you.  Come, now, we are willing to overlook much of your faults, if you will give us a reasonable chance.  Point me out your man, and if he is a proper fellow, I will see that he weds you honestly.  Yes, and I will do more for you, Nais, since this day brings me to a husband.  Seeing that all your estate is confiscate as a penalty for your late rebellion, I will charge myself with your dowry, and give it back to you.  So come, name me the man."  The girl looked at her with a sullen brow.  "I spoke a lie," she said; "there is no man."  I tried myself to give her advocacy.  "The lady doubtless spoke what came to her lips.  When a woman is in the grip of a rude soldiery, any excuse which can save her for the moment must serve.  For myself, I should think it like enough that she would confess to having come back to her old allegiance, if she were asked."  "Sir," said the Empress, "keep your peace.  Any interest you may show in this matter will go far to offend me. You have spoken of Nais in your narrative before, and although your tongue was shrewd and you did not say much, I am a woman and I could read between the lines.  Now regard, my rebel, I have no wish to be unduly hard upon you, though once you were my fan-girl, and so your running away to these ill-kempt malcontents, who beat their heads against my city walls, is all the more naughty.  But you must meet me halfway.  You must give an excuse for leniency.  Point me out the man you would wed, and he shall be your husband to-morrow."  "There is no man."  "Then name me one at random.  Why, my pretty Nais, not ten months ago there were a score who would have leaped at the chance of having you for a wife.  Drop your coyness, girl, and name me one of those.  I warrant you that I will be your ambassadress and will put the matter to him with such delicacy that he will not make you blush by refusal."  The prisoner moistened her lips.  "I am a maiden, and I have a maiden's modesty.  I will die as you choose, but I will not do this indecency."  "Well, I am a maiden too, and though because I am Empress also, questions of State have to stand before questions of my private modesty, I can have a sympathy for yours--although in truth it did not obtrude unduly when you were my fan-girl, Nais.  No, come to think of it, you liked a tender glance and a pretty phrase as well as any when you were fan-girl.  You have grown wild and shy, amongst these savage rebels, but I will not punish you for that.  "Let me call your favourites to memory now.  There was Tarca, of course, but Tarca had a difference with that ill-dressed father of yours, and wears a leprosy on half his face instead of that beard he used to trim so finely.  And then there is Tatho, but Tatho is away overseas.  Eron, too, you liked once, but be lost an arm in fighting t'other day, and I would not marry you to less than a whole man.  Ah, by my face!  I have it, the dainty exquisite, Rota!  He is the husband!  How well I remember the way he used to dress in a change of garb each day to catch your proud fancy, girl.  Well, you shall have Rota.  He shall lead you to wife before this hour to-morrow."  Again the prisoner moistened her lips.  "I will not have Rota, and spare me the others.  I know why you mock me, Phorenice."  "Then there are three of us here who share one knowledge."--She turned her eyes upon me.  Gods! who ever saw the like of Phorenice's eyes, and who ever saw them lit with such fire as burned within them then?--"My lord, you are marrying me for policy; I am marrying you for policy, and for another reason which has grown stronger of late, and which you may guess at.  Do you wish still to carry out the match?"  I looked once at Nais, and then I looked steadily back to Phorenice.  The command given by the mouth of Zaemon from the High Council of the Sacred Mountain had to outweigh all else, and I answered that such was my desire.  "Then," said she, glowering at me with her eyes, "you shall build me up the pretty body of Nais beneath a throne of granite as a wedding gift.  And you shall do it too with your own proper hands, my Deucalion, whilst I watch your devotion."  And to Nais she turned with a cruel smile.  "You lied to me, my girl, and you spoke truth to the soldiers in the harbour forts.  There is a man here in the city you came after, and he is the one man you may not have.  Because you know me well, and my methods very thoroughly, your love for him must be very deep, or you would not have come.  And so, being here, you shall be put beyond mischief's reach.  I am not one of those who see luxury in fostering rivals.  "You came for attention at the hands of Deucalion.  By my face! you shall have it.  I will watch myself whilst he builds you up living."    11.  AN AFFAIR WITH THE BARBAROUS FISHERS   So this mighty Empress chose to be jealous of a mere woman prisoner!  Now my mind has been trained to work with a soldierly quickness in these moments of stress, and I decided on my proper course on the instant the words had left her lips.  I was sacrificing myself for Atlantis by order of the High Council of the Priests, and, if needful, Nais must be sacrificed also, although in the same flash a scheme came to me for saving her.  So I bowed gravely before the Empress, and said I, "In this, and in all other things where a mere human hand is potent, I will carry out your wishes, Phorenice."  And she on her part patted my arm, and fresh waves of feeling welled up from the depths of her wondrous eyes.  Surely the Gods won for her half her schemes and half her battles when they gave Phorenice her shape, and her voice, and the matters which lay within the outlines of her face.  By this time the merchants, and the other dwellers adjacent to this part of the harbour, where the royal quay stands, had come down, offering changes of raiment, and houses to retire into.  Phorenice was all graciousness, and though it was little enough I cared for mere wetness of my coat, still that part of the harbour into which we had been thrown by the mammoth was not over savoury, and I was glad enough to follow her example.  For myself, I said no further word to Nais, and refrained even from giving her a glance of farewell.  But a small sop like this was no meal for Phorenice, and she gave the port-captain strict orders for the guarding of his prisoner before she left him.  At the house into which I was ushered they gave me a bath, and I eased my host of the plainest garment in his store, and he was pleased enough at getting off so cheaply.  But I had an hour to spend outside on the pavement listening to the distant din of bombardment before Phorenice came out to me again, and I could not help feeling some grim amusement at the face of the merchant who followed.  The fellow was clearly ruined.  He had a store of jewels and gauds of the most costly kind, which were only in fraction his own, seeing that he had bought them (as the custom is) in partnership with other merchants.  These had pleased Phorenice's eye, and so she had taken all and disposed them on her person.  "Are they not pretty?" said she, showing them to me.  "See how they flash under the sun.  I am quite glad now, Deucalion, that the mammoth gave us that furious ride and that spill, since it has brought me such a bonny present.  You may tell the fellow here that some day when he has earned some more, I will come and be his guest again.  Ah!  They have brought us litters, I see.  Well, send one away and do you share mine with me, sir.  We must play at being lovers to-day, even if love is a matter which will come to us both with more certainty to-morrow.  No; do not order more bearers.  My own slaves will carry us handily enough.  I am glad you are not one of your gross, overfed men, Deucalion.  I am small and slim myself, and I do not want to be husbanded by a man who will overshadow me."  "Back to the royal pyramid?" I asked.  "No, nor to the walls.  I neither wish to fight nor to sit as Empress to-day, sir.  As I have told you before, it is my whim to be Phorenice, the maiden, for a few hours, and if some one I wot of would woo me now, as other maidens are wooed, I should esteem it a luxury.  Bid the slaves carry us round the harbour's rim, and give word to these starers that, if they follow, I will call down fire upon them as I did upon the sacrifice."  Now, I had seen something of the unruliness of the streets myself, and I had gathered a hint also from the officer at the gate of the royal pyramid that night of Phorenice's welcoming banquet.  But as whatever there was in the matter must be common knowledge to the Empress, I did not bring it to her memory then.  So I dismissed the guard which had come up, and drove away with a few sharp words the throng of gaping sightseers who always, silly creatures, must needs come to stare at their betters; and then I sat in the litter in the place where I was invited, and the bearers put their heads to the pole.  They swung away with us along the wide pavement which runs between the houses of the merchants and the mariner folk and the dimpling waters of the harbour, and I thought somewhat sadly of the few ships that floated on that splendid basin now, and of the few evidences of business that showed themselves on the quays.  Time was when the ships were berthed so close that many had to wait in the estuary outside the walls, and memorials had been sent to the King that the port should be doubled in size to hold the glut of trade.  And that, too, in the old days of oar and sail, when machines drawing power from our Lord the Sun were but rarely used to help a vessel speedily along her course.  The Egypt voyage and a return was a matter of a year then, as against a brace of months now, and of three ships that set out, one at least could be reckoned upon succumbing to the dangers of the wide waters and the terrible beasts that haunt them.  But in those old days trade roared with lusty life, and was ever growing wider and more heavy.  Your merchant then was a portly man and gave generously to the Gods.  But now all the world seemed to be in arms, and moreover trade was vulgar.  Your merchant, if he was a man of substance, forgot his merchandise, swore that chaffering was more indelicate than blasphemy and curled his beard after the new fashion, and became a courtier.  Where his father had spent anxious days with cargo tally and ship-master, the son wasted hours in directing sewing men as they adorned a coat, and nights in vapouring at a banquet.  Of the smaller merchants who had no substance laid by, taxes and the constant bickerings of war had wellnigh ground them into starvation.  Besides, with the country in constant uproar, there were few markets left for most merchandise, nor was there aught made now which could be carried abroad.  If your weaver is pressed as a fire-tube man he does not make cloth, and if your farmer is playing at rebellion, he does not buy slaves to till his fields.  Indeed, they told me that a month before my return, as fine a cargo of slaves had been brought into harbour as ever came out of Europe, and there was nothing for it but to set them ashore across the estuary, and leave them free to starve or live in the wild ground there as they chose.  There was no man in all Atlantis who would hold so much as one more slave as a gift.  But though I was grieved at this falling away, all schemes for remedy would be for afterwards.  It would only make ill worse to speak of it as we rode together in the litter.  I was growing to know Phorenice's moods enough for that.  Still, I think that she too had studied mine, and did her best to interest me between her bursts of trifling.  We went out to where the westernmost harbour wall joins the land, and there the panting bearers set us down.  She led me into a little house of stone which stood by itself, built out on a promontory where there is a constant run of tide, and when we had been given admittance, after much unbarring, she showed me her new gold collectors.  In the dry knowledge taught in the colleges and groves of the Sacred Mountain it had been a common fact to us that the metal gold was present in a dissolved state in all sea water, but of plans for dragging it forth into yellow hardness, none had ever been discussed. But here this field-reared upstart of an Empress had stumbled upon the trick as though it had been written in a book.  She patted my arm laughingly as I stared curiously round the place.  "I tell all others in Atlantis that only the Gods have this secret," said she, "and that They gave it to me as one of themselves.  But I am no Goddess to you, am I, Deucalion?  And, by my face!  I have no other explanation of how this plan was invented.  We'll suppose I must have dreamed it.  Look!  The sea-water sluices in through that culvert, and passes over these rough metal plates set in the floor, and then flows out again yonder in its natural course.  You see the yellow metal caught in the ridges of the plates?  That is gold.  And my fellows here melt it with fire into bars, and take it to my smith's in the city.  The tides vary constantly, as you priests know well, as the quiet moon draws them, and it does not take much figuring to know how much of the sea passes through these culverts in a month and how much gold to a grain should be caught in the plates.  My fellows here at first thought to cheat me, but I towed two of them in the water once behind a galley till the cannibal fish ate them, and since then the others have given me credit for--for what do you think?"  "More divinity."  "I suppose it is that.  But I am letting you see how it is done.  Just have the head to work out a little sum, and see what an effect can be gained.  You will be a God yet yourself, Deucalion, with these silly Atlanteans, if only you will use your wit and cleverness."  Was she laughing at me?  Was she in earnest?  I could not tell.  Sometimes she pointed out that her success and triumphs were merely the reward of thought and brilliancy, and next moment she gave me some impossible explanation and left me to deduce that she must be more than mortal or the thing could never have been found.  In good truth, this little woman with her supple mind and her supple body mystified me more and more the longer I stayed by her side; and more and more despairing did I grow that Atlantis could ever be restored by my agency to peace and the ancient Gods, even after I had carried out the commands of the High Council, and taken her to wife.  Only one plan seemed humanly possible, and that was to curb her further mischievousness by death and then leave the wretched country naturally to recover.  It was just a dagger-stroke, and the thing was done.  Yet the very idea of this revolted me, and when the desperate thought came to my mind (which it did ever and anon), I hugged to myself the answer that if it were fitting to do this thing, the High Gods in Their infinite wisdom would surely have put definite commands upon me for its carrying out.  Yet, such was the fascination of Phorenice, that when presently we left her gold collectors, and stumbled into such peril, that a little withholding of my hand would have gained her a passage to the nether Gods, I found myself fighting when she called upon me, as seldom I have fought before.  And though, of course, some blame for this must be laid upon that lust of battle which thrills even the coldest of us when blows begin to whistle and war-cries start to ring, there is no doubt also that the pleasure of protecting Phorenice, and the distaste for seeing her pulled down by those rude, uncouth fishers put special nerve and vehemence into my blows.  The cause of the matter was the unrest and the prevalency to street violence which I have spoken of above, and the desperate poverty of the common people, which led them to take any risk if it showed them a chance of winning the wherewithal to purchase a meal.  We had once more mounted the litter, and once more the bearers, with their heads beneath the pole, bore us on at their accustomed swinging trot.  Phorenice was telling me about her new supplies of gold.  She had made fresh sumptuary laws, it appeared.  "In the old days," said she, "when yellow gold was tediously dredged up grain by grain from river gravels in the dangerous lands, a quill full would cost a rich man's savings, and so none but those whose high station fitted them to be so adorned could wear golden ornaments.  But when the sea-water gave me gold here by the double handful a day, I found that the price of these river hoards decreased, and one day--could you credit it?--a common fellow, who was one of my smiths, came to me wearing a collar of yellow gold on his own common neck.  Well, I had that neck divided, as payment for his presumption; and as I promised to repeat the division promptly on all other offenders, that special species of forwardness seems to be checked for the time.  There are many exasperations, Deucalion, in governing these common people."  She had other things to say upon the matter, but at this point I saw two clumsy boats of fishers paddling to us from over the ripples, and at the same time amongst the narrow lanes which led between the houses on the other side of us, savage-faced men were beginning to run after the litter in threatening clusters.  "With permission," I said, "I will step out of the conveyance and scatter this rabble."  "Oh, the people always cluster round me.  Poor ugly souls, they seem to take a strange delight in coming to stare at my pretty looks.  But scatter them.  I have said I did not wish to be followed.  I am taking holiday now, Deucalion, am I not, whilst you learn to woo me?"  I stepped to the ground.  The rough fishers in the boats were beginning to shout to those who dodged amongst the houses to see to it that we did not escape, and the numbers who hemmed us in on the shore side were increasing every moment.  The prospect was unpleasant enough.  We had come out beyond the merchants' quarters, and were level with those small huts of mud and grass which the fishing population deem sufficient for shelter, and which has always been a spot where turbulence might be expected.  Indeed, even in those days of peace and good government in the old King's time, this part of the city had rarely been without its weekly riot.  The life of the fisherman is the most hard that any human toilers have to endure.  Violence from the wind and waves, and pelting from firestones out of the sky are their daily portion; the great beasts that dwell in the seas hunt them with savage persistence, and it is a rare day when at least some one of the fishers' guild fails to come home to answer the tally.  Moreover, the manner which prevails of catching fish is not without its risks.  To each man there is a large sea-fowl taken as a nestling, and trained to the work.  A ring of bronze is round its neck to prevent its swallowing the spoil for which it dives, and for each fish it takes and flies back with to the boat, the head and tail and inwards are given to it for a reward, the ring being removed whilst it makes the meal.  The birds are faithful, once they have got a training, and are seldom known to desert their owners; but, although the fishers treat them more kindly than they do their wives, or children of their own begetting, the life of the birds is precarious like that of their masters.  The larger beasts and fish of the sea prey on them as they prey on the smaller fish, and so whatever care may be lavished upon them, they are most liable to sudden cutting off.  And here is another thing that makes the life of the fisher most precarious: if his fishing bird be slain, and the second which he has in training also come by ill fortune, he is left suddenly bereft of all utensils of livelihood, and (for aught his guild-fellows care) he may  go starve.  For these fishers hold that the Gods of the sea regulate their craft, and that if one is not pleasing to Them They rob him of his birds; after which it would be impious to have any truck or dealing with such a fellow; and accordingly he is left to starve or rob as he chooses.  All of which circumstances tend to make the fishers rude, desperate men, who have been forced into the trade because all other callings have rejected them.  They are fellows, moreover, who will spend the gains of a month on a night's debauch, for fear that the morrow will rob them of life and the chance of spending; and, moreover, it is their one point of honour to be curbed in no desire by an ordinary fear of consequences.  As will appear.  I went quickly towards the largest knot of these people, who were skulking behind the houses, leaving the litter halted in the path behind me, and I bade them sharply enough to disperse.  "For an employment," I added, "put your houses in order, and clean the fish offal from the lanes between them.  To-morrow I will come round here to inspect, and put this quarter into a better order.  But for to-day the Empress (whose name be adored) wishes for a privacy, so cease your staring."  "Then give us money," said a shrill voice from amongst the huts.  "I will send you a torch in an hour's time," I said grimly, "and rig you a gallows, if you give me more annoyance.  To your kennels, you!"  I think they would have obeyed the voice of authority if they had been left to themselves.  There was a quick stir amongst them.  Those that stood in the sunlight instinctively slipped into the shadow, and many dodged into the houses and cowered in dark corners out of sight.  But the men in the two hide-covered fisher-boats that were paddling up, called them back with boisterous cries.  I signed to the litter-bearers to move on quickly along their road.  There was need of discipline here, and I was minded to deal it out myself with a firm hand.  I judged that I could prevent them following the Empress, but if she still remained as a glittering bait for them to rob, and I had to protect her also, it might be that my work would not be done so effectively.  But it seems I was presumptuous in giving an order which dealt with the person of Phorenice.  She bade the bearers stand where they were, and stepped out, and drew her weapons from beneath the cushions.  She came towards me strapping a sword on to her hip, and carrying a well-dinted target of gold on her left forearm.  "An unfair trick," cries she, laughing.  "If you will keep a fight to yourself now, Deucalion, where will your greediness carry you when I am your shrinking, wistful little wife?  Are these fools truly going to stand up against us?"  I was not coveting a fight, but it seemed as if there would be no avoidance of it now.  The robe and the glittering gauds of which Phorenice had recently despoiled the merchant, drew the eyes of these people with keen attraction.  The fishers in the boats paddled into the surf which edged the beach, and leaped overside and left the frail basket-work structures to be spewed up sound or smashed, as chance ordered.  And from the houses, and from the filthy lanes between them, poured out hordes of others, women mixed with the men, gathering round us threateningly.  "Have a care," shouted one on the outskirts of the crowd.  "She called down fire for the sacrifice once to-day, and she can burn up others here if she chooses."  "So much the more for those that are left," retorted another.  "She cannot burn all."  "Nay, I will not burn any," said Phorenice, "but you shall look upon my sword-play till you are tired."  I heard her say that with some malicious amusement, knowing (as one of the Seven) how she had called down the fires of the sky to burn that cloven-hoofed horse offered in sacrifice, and knowing too, full well, that she could bring down no fire here.  But they gave us little enough time for wordy courtesies.  Their Empress never went far unattended, and, for aught the wretches knew, an escort might be close behind.  So what pilfering they did, it behoved them to get done quickly.  They closed in, jostling one another to be first, and the reek of their filthy bodies made us cough.  A grimy hand launched out to seize some of the jewels which flashed on Phorenice's breast, and I lopped it off at the elbow, so that it fell at her feet, and a second later we were engaged.  "Your back to mine, comrade," cried she, with a laugh, and then drew and laid about her with fine dexterity.  Bah! but it was mere slaughter, that first bout.  The crowd hustled inwards with such greediness to seize what they could, that none had space to draw back elbow for a thrust, and we two kept a circle round us by sheer whirling of steel.  It is necessary to do one's work cleanly in these bouts, as wounded left on the ground unnoticed before one are as dangerous as so many snakes.  But as we circled round in our battling I noted that all of Phorenice's quarry lay peaceful and still.  By the Gods! but she could play a fine sword, this dainty Empress.  She touched life with every thrust.  Yes, it was plain to see, now an example was given, that the throne of Atlantis had been won, not by a lovely face and a subtle tongue alone; and (as a fighter myself) I did not like Phorenice the less for the knowledge.  I could but see her out of the corner of my eye, and that only now and again, for the fishers, despite their ill-knowledge of fence, and the clumsiness of their weapons, had heavy numbers, and most savage ferocity; and as they made so confident of being able to pull us down, it required more than a little hard battling to keep them from doing it.  Ay, by the Gods! it was at times a fight my heart warmed to, and if I had not contrived to pluck a shield from one fool who came too vain-gloriously near me with one, I could not swear they would not have dragged me down by sheer ravening savageness.  And always above the burly uproar of the fight came very pleasantly to my ears Phorenice's cry of "Deucalion!" which she chose as her battle shout.  I knew her, of course, to be a past-mistress of the art of compliment, and it was no new thing for me to hear the name roared out above a battle din, but it was given there under circumstances which were peculiar, and for the life of me I could not help being tickled by the flattery.  Condemn my weakness how you will, but I came very near then to liking the Empress of Atlantis in the way she wished.  And as for that other woman who should have filled my mind, I will confess that the stress of the moment, and the fury of the engagement, had driven both her and her strait completely out beyond the marches of my memory.  Of such frail stuff are we made, even those of us who esteem ourselves the strongest.  Now it is a temptation few men born to the sword can resist, to throw themselves heart and soul into a fight for a fight's sake, and it seems that women can be bitten with the same fierce infection.  The attack slackened and halted.  We stood in the middle of a ring of twisted dead, and the rest of the fishers and their women who hemmed us in shrank back out of reach of our weapons.  It was the moment for a truce, and the moment when a few strong words would have sent them back cowering to their huts, and given us free passage to go where we chose.  But no, this Phorenice must needs sing a hymn to her sword and mine, gloating over our feats and invulnerability; and then she must needs ask payment for the bearers of her litter whom they had killed, and then speak balefully of the burnings, and the skinnings, and the sawings asunder with which this fishers' quarter would be treated in the near future, till they learned the virtues of deportment and genteel manners.  "It makes your backs creep, does it?" said Phorenice.  "I do not wonder.  This severity must have its unpleasant side.  But why do you not put it beyond my power to give the order?  Either you must think yourselves Gods or me no Goddess, or you would not have gone on so far.  Come now, you nasty-smelling people, follow out your theory, and if you make a good fight of it, I swear by my face I will be lenient with those who do not fall."  But there was no pressing up to meet our swords.  They still ringed us in, savage and sullen, beyond the ring of their own dead, and would neither run back to the houses, nor give us the game of further fight.  There was a certain stubborn bravery about them that one could not but admire, and for myself I determined that next time it became my duty to raise troops, I would catch a handful of these men, and teach them handiness with the utensils of war, and train them to loyalty and faithfulness.  But presently from behind their ranks a stone flew, and though it whizzed between the Empress and myself, and struck down a fisher, it showed that they had brought a new method into their attack, and it behoved us to take thought and meet it.  I looked round me up and down the beach.  There was no sign of a rescue.  "Phorenice," I said in the court tongue, which these barbarous fishers would know little enough of, "I take it that a whiff of the sea-breeze would come very pleasant after all this warm play.  As you can show such pretty sword work, will you cut me a way down to the beach, and I will do my poor best to keep these creatures from snapping at our heels?"  "Oh!" cried she.  "Then I am to have a courtier for a husband after all.  Why have you kept back your flattering speeches till now?  Is that your trick to make me love you?"  "I will think out the reason for it another time."  "Ah, these stern, commanding husbands," said she, "how they do press upon their little wives!" and with that leaped over the ring of dead before her, and cut and stabbed a way through those that stood between her and the waters which creamed and crashed upon the beach.  Gods! what a charge she made.  It made me tingle with admiration as I followed sideways behind her, guarding the rear.  And I am a man that has spent so many years in battling, that it takes something far out of the common to move me to any enthusiasm in this matter.  There were two boats creaking and washing about in the edge of the surf, but in one, happily, the wicker-work which made its frame was crushed by the weight of the waves into a shapeless bundle of sticks, and would take half a day to replace.  So that, let us but get the other craft afloat, and we should be free from further embroiling.  But the fishers were quick to see the object of this new manoeuvre.  "Guard the boat," they shouted.  "Smash her; slit her skin with your knives!  Tear her with your fingers!  Swim her out to sea!  Oh, at least take the paddles!"  But, if these clumsy fishers could run, Phorenice was like a legged snake for speed.  She was down beside the boat before any could reach it, laughing and shouting out that she could beat them at every point.  Myself, I was slower of foot; and, besides, there was some that offered me a fight on the road, and I was not wishful to baulk them; and moreover, the fewer we left clamouring behind, the fewer there would be to speed our going with their stones.  Still I came to the beach in good order, and laid hands on the flimsy boat and tipped her dry.  "Fighting is no trade for, me," I cried, "whilst you are here, Phorenice.  Guard me my back and walk out into the water."  I took the boat, thrusting it afloat, and wading with it till two lines of the surf were past.  The fishers swarmed round us, active as fish in their native element, and strove mightily to get hands on the boat and slit the hides which covered it with their eager fingers.  But I had a spare hand, and a short stabbing-knife for such close-quarter work, and here, there, and everywhere was Phorenice the Empress, with her thirsty dripping sword.  By the Gods!  I laughed with sheer delight at seeing her art of fence.  But the swirl of a great fish into the shallows, and the squeal of a fisher as he was dragged down and home away into the deep, made me mindful of foes that no skill can conquer, and no bravery avoid.  Without taking time to give the Empress a word of warning, I stooped, and flung an arm round her, and threw her up out of the water into the boat, and then thrust on with all my might, driving the flimsy craft out to sea, whilst my legs crept under me for fear of the beasts which swam invisible beneath the muddied waters.  To the fishers, inured to these horrid perils by daily association, the seizing of one of their number meant little, and they pressed on, careless of their dull lives, eager only to snatch the jewels which still flaunted on Phorenice's breast.  Of the vengeance that might come after they recked nothing; let them but get the wherewithal for one night's good debauch, and they would forget that such a thing as the morning of a morrow could have existence.  Two fellows I caught and killed that, diving down beneath, tried to slit the skin of the boat out of sight under the water; and Phorenice cared for all those that tried to put a hand on the gunwales.  Yes, and she did more than that.  A huge long-necked turtle that was stirred out of the mud by the turmoil, came up to daylight, and swung its great horn-lipped mouth to this side and that, seeking for a prey.  The fishers near it dodged and dived.  I, thrusting at the stern of the boat, could only hope it would pass me by and so offered an easy mark.  It scurried towards me, champing its noisy lips, and beating the water into spray with its flippers.  But Phorenice was quick with a remedy and a rescue.  She passed her sword through one of the fishers that pressed her, and then thrust the body towards the turtle.  The great neck swooped towards it; the long slimy feelers which protruded from its head quivered and snuffled; and then the horny green jaws crunched on it, and drew it down out of sight.  The boat was in deep water now, and Phorenice called upon me to come in over the side, she the while balancing nicely so that the flimsy thing should not be overset.  The fishers had given up their pursuit, finding that they earned nothing but lopped-off arms and split faces by coming within swing of this terrible sword of their Empress, and so contented themselves with volleying jagged stones in the hopes of stunning us or splitting the boat.  However, Phorenice crouched in the stern, holding the two shields--her own golden target, and the rough hide buckler I had won--and so protected both of us whilst I paddled, and though many stones clattered against the shields, and hit the hide covering of the boat, so that it resounded like a drum, none of them did damage, and we drew quickly out of their range.    12.  THE DRUG OF OUR LADY THE MOON   Our Lord the Sun was riding towards the end of His day, and the smoke from a burning mountain fanned black and forbidding before His face.  Phorenice wrung the water from her clothes and shivered.  "Work hard with those paddles, Deucalion, and take me in through the water-gate and let me be restored to my comforts again.  That merchant would rue if he saw how his pretty garments were spoiled, and I rue, too, being a woman, and remembering that he at least has no others I can take in place of these."  She looked at me sidelong, tossing back the short red hair from her eyes.  "What think you of my wisdom in coming where we have come without an escort?"  "The Empress can do no wrong," I quoted the old formula with a smile.  "At least I have shown you that I can fight.  I caught you looking your approval of me quite pleasantly once or twice.  You were a difficult man to thaw, Deucalion, but you warm perceptibly as you keep on being near me.  La, sir, we shall be a pair of rustic sweethearts yet, if this goes on.  I am glad I thought of the device of going near those smelly fishers."  So she had taken me out in the litter unattended for the plain purpose of inviting a fight, and showing me her skill at arms, and perhaps, too, of seeing in person how I also carried myself in a moment of stress.  Well, if we were to live on together as husband and wife, it was good that each should know to a nicety the other's powers; and also, I am too much of an old battler and too much enamoured with the glorious handling of arms to quarrel very deeply with any one who offers me a tough upstanding fight.  Still for the life of me, I could not help comparing Phorenice with another woman.  With a similar chance open before us, Nais had robbed me of the struggle through a sheer pity for those squalid rebels who did not even call her chieftain; whilst here was this Empress frittering away two score of the hardiest of her subjects merely to gratify a whim.  Yet, loyal to my vow as a priest, and to the commands set upon me by the high council on the Sacred Mountain, I tried to put away these wayward thoughts and comparisons.  As I rowed over the swingings of the waves towards the forts which guard the harbour's mouth, I sent prayers to the High Gods to give my tongue dexterity, and They through Their love for the country of Atlantis, and the harassed people, whom it was my deep wish to serve, granted me that power of speech which Phorenice loved.  Her eyes glowed upon me as I talked.  This beach of the fishers where we had had our passage at arms is safe from ship attack from without, by reason of a chain of jagged rocks which spring up from the deep, and run from the harbour side to the end of the city wall.  The fishers know the passes, and can oftentimes get through to the open water beyond without touching a stone; or if they do see a danger of hitting on the reef, leap out and carry their light boats in their hands till the water floats them again.  But here I had neither the knowledge nor the dexterity, and, thought I, now the High Gods will show finally if They wish this woman who has defiled them to reign on in Atlantis, and if also They wish me to serve as her husband.  I cried these things in my heart, and waited to receive the omen.  There was no half-answer.  A great wave rose in the lagoon behind us, a wave such as could have only been caused by an earth tremor, and on its sleek back we were hurled forward and thrown clear of the reefs with their seaweeds licking round us, without so much as seeing a stone of the barrier.  I bowed my head as I rowed on towards the harbour forts.  It was plain that not yet would the High Gods take vengeance for the insults which this lovely woman had offered Them.  The sentries in the two forts beat drums at one another in their accustomed rotation, and in the growing dusk were going to pay little enough attention to the fishingboat which lay against the great chain clamouring to have it lowered.  But luckily a pair of officers were taking the air of the evening in a stone-dropping turret of the roof of the nearer fort, and these recognised the tone of our shouts.  They silenced the drums, torches were lowered to make sure of our faces, and then with a splash the great chain was dropped into the water to give us passage.  A galley lay inside, nuzzling the harbour wall, and presently the ladder of ropes was let down from the top of the nearest fort, and a crew came down to man the oars.  There were the customary changes of raiment too, given as presents by the officers of the fort, and these we put on in the cabin of the galley in place of the sodden clothes we wore.  There are fevers to be gained by carrying wet clothes after sunset, and though from personal experience I have learned that these may be warded off with drugs, I noticed with some grim amusement that the Empress had sufficiently little of the Goddess about her to fear very much the ailments which are due to frail humanity.  The galley rowed swiftly across the calm waters of the harbour, and made fast to the rings of gold on the royal quay, and whilst we were waiting for litters to be brought, I watched a lantern lit in the boat which stood guard over Phorenice's mammoth.  The huge red beast stood shoulder-deep in the harbour water, with trunk up-turned.  It was tamed now, and the light of the boat's lantern fell on the little ripples sent out by its tremblings.  But I did not choose to intercede or ask mercy for it.  If the mammoth sank deeper in the harbour mud, and was swallowed, I could have borne the loss with equanimity.  To tell the truth, that ride on the great beast's back had impressed me unfavourably.  In fact, it put into me a sense of helplessness that was wellnigh intolerable.  Perhaps circumstances have made me unduly self-reliant: on that others must judge.  But I will own to having a preference for walking on my own proper feet, as the Gods in fashioning our shapes most certainly intended.  On my own feet I am able to guard my own head and neck, and have done on four continents, throughout a long and active life, and on many a thousand occasions.  But on the back of that detestable mammoth, pah! I grew as nervous as a child or a dastard.  However, I had little enough leisure for personal megrims just then.  Whilst we waited, Phorenice asked the port-captain (who must needs come up officiously to make his salutations) after the disposal of Nais, and was told that she had been clapped into a dungeon beneath the royal pyramid, and the officer of the guard there had given his bond for her safe-keeping.  "It is to be hoped he understands his work," said the Empress.  "That pretty Nais knows the pyramid better than most, and it may be he will be sent to the tormentors for putting her in a cell which had a secret outlet.  You would feel pleasure if the girl escaped, Deucalion?"  "Assuredly," said I, knowing how useless it would be to make a secret of the matter.  "I have no enmity against Nais."  "But I have," said she viciously, "and I am still minded to lock your faith to me by that wedding gift you know of."  "The thing shall be done," I said.  "Before all, the Empress of Atlantis."  "Poof!  Deucalion, you are too stiff and formal.  You ought to be mightily honoured that I condescend to be jealous of your favours.  Your hand, sir, please, to help me into the litter.  And now come in beside me, and keep me warm against the night air.  Ho! you guards there with the torches!  Keep farther back against the street walls.  The perfume you are burning stifles me."  Again there was a feast that night in the royal banqueting-hall; again I sat beside Phorenice on the raised dais which stands beneath the symbols of the snake and the out-stretched hand.  What had been taken for granted before about our forthcoming relationship was this time proclaimed openly; the Empress herself acknowledged me as her husband that was to be; and all that curled and jewelled throng of courtiers hailed me as greater than themselves, by reason of this woman's choice.  There was method, too, in their salutation.  Some rumour must have got about of my preference for the older and simpler habits, and there was no drinking wine to my health after the new and (as  I considered) impertinent manner.  Decorously, each lord and lady there came forward, and each in turn spilt a goblet at my feet; and when I called any up, whether man or woman, to receive tit-bits from my platter, it was eaten simply and thankfully, and not kissed or pocketed with any extravagant gesture.  The flaring jets of earth-breath showed me, too, so I thought, a plainer habit of dress, and a more sober mien amongst this thoughtless mob of banqueters.  And, indeed, it must have been plain to notice, for Phorenice, leaning over till the ruddy curls on her shoulder brushed my face, chided me in a playful whisper as having usurped her high authority already.  "Oh, sir," she pleaded mockingly, "do not make your rule over us too ascetic.  I have given no orders for this change, but to-night there are no perfumes in the air; the food is so plain and I have half a mind to burn the cook; and as for the clothes and gauds of these diners, by my face! they might have come straight from the old King's reign before I stepped in here to show how tasteful could be colours on a robe, or how pretty the glint of a jewel.  It's done by no orders of mine, Deucalion.  They have swung round to this change by sheer courtier instinct.  Why, look at the beards of the men!  There is not half the curl about many of them to-day that they showed with such exquisiteness yesterday.  By my face!  I believe they'd reap their chins to-morrow as smooth as yours, if you go on setting the fashions at this prodigious rate and I do not interfere."  "Why hinder them if they feel more cleanly shaven?"  "No, sir.  There shall be only one clean chin where a beard can grow in all Atlantis, and that shall be carried by the man who is husband to the Empress.  Why, my Deucalion, would you have no sumptuary laws?  Would you have these good folk here and the common people outside imitate us in every cut of the hair and every fold of a garment which it pleases us to discover?  Come, sir, if you and I chose to say that our sovereignty was marked only by our superior strength of arm and wit, they would hate us at once for our arrogance; whereas, if we keep apart to ourselves a few mere personal decorations, these become just objects to admire and pleasantly envy."  "You show me that there is more in the office of a ruler than meets the eye."  "And yet they tell me, and indeed show me, that you have ruled with some success."  "I employed the older method.  It requires a Phorenice to invent these nicer flights."  "Flatterer!" said she, and smote me playfully with the back of her little fingers on my arm.  "You are becoming as great a courtier as any of them.  You make me blush with your fine pleasantries, Deucalion, and there is no fan-girl here to-night to cool my cheek.  I must choose me another fan-girl.  But it shall not be Ylga.  Ylga seems to have more of a kindness for you than I like, and if she is wise she will go live in her palace at the other side of the city, and there occupy herself with the ordering of her slaves, and the makings of embroideries.  I shall not be hard on Ylga unless she forces me, but I will have no woman in this kingdom treat you with undue civility."  "And how am I to act," said I, falling in with her mood, "when I see and hear all the men of Atlantis making their protestations before you?  By your own confession they all love you as ardently as they seem to have loved you hopelessly."  "Ah, now," she said, "you must not ask me to do impossibilities.  I am powerful if you will.  But I have no force which will govern the hearts of these poor fellows on matters such as that.  But if you choose, you make proclamation that I am given now body and inwards to you, and if they continue to offend your pride in this matter, you may take your culprits, and give them over to the tormentors.  Indeed, Deucalion, I think it would be a pretty attention to me if you did arrange some such ceremony.  It seems to me a present," she added with a frown, "that the jealousy is too much on one side."  "You must not expect that a man who has been divorced from love for all of a busy life can learn all its niceties in an instant.  Myself, I was feeling proud of my progress.  With any other schoolmistress than you, Phorenice, I should not be near so forward.  In fact (if one may judge by my past record), I should not have begun to learn at all."  "I suppose you think I should be satisfied with that?  Well, I am not.  I can be finely greedy over some matters."  The banquet this night did not extend to inordinate length.  Phorenice had gone through much since last she slept, and though she had declared herself Goddess in the meantime, it seemed that her body remained mortal as heretofore.  The black rings of weariness had grown under her wondrous eyes, and she lay back amongst the cushions of the divan with her limbs slackened and listless.  When the dancers came and postured before us, she threw them a jewel and bade them begone before they had given a half of their performance, and the poet, a silly swelling fellow who came to sing the deeds of the day, she would not hear at all.  "To-morrow," she said wearily, "but for now grant me peace.  My Lord Deucalion has given me much food for thought this day, and presently I go to my chamber to muse over the future policies of this State throughout the night.  To-morrow come to me again, and if your poetry is good and short, I will pay you surprisingly. But see to it that you are not long-winded.  If there are superfluous words, I will pay you for those with the stick."  She rose to her feet then, and when the banqueters had made their salutation to us, I led her away from the banqueting-hall and down the passages with their secret doors which led to her private chambers.  She clung on my arm, and once when we halted whilst a great stone block swung slowly ajar to let us pass, she drooped her head against my shoulder.  Her breath came warm against my cheek, and the loveliness of her face so close at hand surpasses the description of words.  I think it was in her mind that I should kiss the red lips which were held so near to mine, but willing though I was to play the part appointed, I could not bring myself to that.  So when the stone block had swung, she drew away with a sigh, and we went on without further speech.  "May the High Gods treat you tenderly," I said, when we came to the door of her bed-chamber.  "I am my own God," said she, "in all things but one.  By my face! you are a tardy wooer, Deucalion.  Where do you go now?"  "To my own chamber."  "Oh, go then, go."  "Is there anything more I could do?"  "Nothing that your wit or your will would prompt you to.  Yes, indeed, you are finely decorous, Deucalion, in your old-fashioned way, but you are a mighty poor wooer.  Don't you know, my man, that a woman esteems some things the more highly if they are taken from her by rude force?"  "It seems I know little enough about women."  "You never said a truer word.  Bah!  And I believe your coldness brings you more benefit in a certain matter than any show of passion could earn.  There, get you gone, if the atmosphere of a maiden's bed-chamber hurts your rustic modesty, and your Gods keep you, Deucalion, if that's the phrase, and if you think They can do it.  Get you gone, man, and leave me solitary."  I had taken the plan of the pyramid out of the archives before the banquet and learned it thoroughly, and so was able to thread my way through its angular mazes without pause or blunder.  I, too, was heavily wearied with what I had gone through since my last snatch of sleep, but I dare set apart no time for rest just then.  Nais must be sacrificed in part for the needs of Atlantis; but a plan had come to me by which it seemed that she need not be sacrificed wholly; and to carry this through there was need for quick thought and action.  Help came to me also from a quarter I did not expect.  As I passed along the tortuous way between the ponderous stones of the pyramid, which led to the apartments that had been given me by Phorenice, a woman glided up out of the shadows of one of the side passages, and when I lifted my hand lamp, there was Ylga.  She regarded me half-sullenly.  "I have lost my place," she said, "and it seems I need never have spoken.  She intended to have you all along, and it was not a thing like that which could put her off.  And you--you just think me officious, if, indeed, you have ever given me another thought till now."  "I never forget a kindness."  "Oh, you will learn that trick soon now.  And you are going to marry her, you!  The city is ringing with it. I thought at least you were honest, but when there is a high place to be got by merely taking a woman with it, you are like the rest.  I thought, too, that you would be one of those men who have a distrust for ruddy hair.  And, besides she is little."  "Ylga," I said, "you have taught me that these walls are full of crannies and ears.  I will listen to no word against Phorenice.  But I would have further converse with you soon.  If you still have a kindness for me, go to the chamber that is mine and wait for me there.  I will join you shortly."  She drooped her eyes.  "What do you want of me, Deucalion?"  "I want to say something to you.  You will learn who it concerns later."  "But is it--is it fitting for a maiden to come to a man's room at this hour?"  "I know little of your conventions here in this new Atlantis.  I am Deucalion, girl, and if you still have qualms, remembering that, do not come."  She looked up at me with a sneer.  "I was foolish," she said.  "My lord's coldness has grown into a proverb, and I should have remembered it.  Yes; I will come."  "Go now, then," said I, and waited till she had passed on ahead and was out of sight and hearing.  With Ylga to help me, my tasks were somewhat lightened, and their sequence changed.  In the first instance, now, I had got to make my way with as little delay and show as possible into a certain sanctuary which lay within the temple of our Lady the Moon.  And here my knowledge as one of the Seven stood me in high favour.  All the temples of the city of Atlantis are in immediate and secret connection with the royal pyramid, but the passages are little used, seeing that they are known only to the Seven and to the Three above them, supposing that there are three men living at one time sufficiently learned in the highest of the highest mysteries to be installed in that sublime degree of the Three.  And, even by these, the secret ways may only be used on occasions of the greatest stress, so that a generation well may pass without their being trodden by a human foot.  It was with some trouble, and after no little experiment that I groped my way into this secret alley; but once there, the rest was easy.  I had never trodden it before certainly, but the plan of it had been taught me at my initiation as one of the Seven, and the course of the windings came back to me now with easy accuracy. I walked quickly, not only because the air in those deep crannies is always full of lurking evils, but also because the hours were fleeting, and much must be done before our Lord the Sun again rose to make another day.  I came to the spy-place which commands the temple, and found the holy place empty, and, alas! dust-covered, and showing little trace that worshippers ever frequented it these latter years.  A vast stone of the wall swung outwards and gave me entrance, and presently (after the solemn prayer which is needful before attempting these matters), I took the metal stair from the place where it is kept, and climbed to the lap of the Goddess, and then, pulling the stair after me, climbed again upwards till my length lay against her calm mysterious face.  A shivering seized me as I thought of what was intended, for even a warrior hardened to horrid sights and deeds may well have qualms when he is called upon to juggle with life and death, and years and history, with the welfare of his country in one hand, and the future of a woman who is as life to him in the other.  But again I told myself that the hours flew, and laid hold of the jewel which is studded into the forehead of the image with one hand, and then stretching out, thrust at a corner of the eyebrow with the other.  With a faint creak the massive eyeball below, a stone that I could barely have covered with my back, swung inwards.  I stepped off the stair, and climbed into the gap.  Inside was the chamber which is hollowed from the head of the Goddess.  It was the first time I had seen this most secret place, but the aspect of it was familiar to me from my teaching, and I knew where to find the thing which would fill my need.  Yet, occupied though I might be with the stress of what was to befall, I could not help having a wonder and an admiration for the cleverness with which it was hidden.  High as I was in the learning and mysteries of the Priestly Clan, the structure of what I had come to fetch was hidden from me.  Beforetime I had known only of their power and effect; and now that I came to handle them, I saw only some roughly rounded balls, like nut kernels, grass green in colour, and in hardness like the wax of bees.  There were three of these balls in the hidden place, and I took the one that was needful, concealing the others as I had found them.  It may have been a drug, it may have been something more; what exactly it was I did not know; only of its power and effect I was sure, as that was set forth plainly in the teaching I had learned; and so I put it in a pouch of my garment, returning by the way I had come, and replacing all things in due order behind me.  One look I took at the image of the Goddess before I left the temple.  The jet of earth-breath which burns eternally from the central altar lit her from head to toe, and threw sparkles from the great jewel in her forehead.  Vast she was, and calm and peaceful beyond all human imaginings, a perfect symbolism of that rest and quietness which many sigh for so vainly on this rude earth, but which they will never attain unless by their piety they earn a place in the hereafter, where our Lady the Moon and the rest of the High Ones reign in Their eternal glorious majesty.  It was with tired dragging limbs that I made my way back again to the royal pyramid, and at last came to my own private chamber.  Ylga awaited me there, though at first I did not see her.  The suspicions of these modern days had taken a deep hold of the girl, and she must needs crouch in hiding till she made sure it was I who came to the chamber, and, moreover, that I came alone.  "Oh, frown at me if you choose," said she sullenly, "I am past caring now for your good opinion.  I had heard so much of Deucalion, and I thought I read honesty in you when first you came ashore; but now I know that you are no better than the rest.  Phorenice offers you a high place, and you marry her blithely to get it.  And why, indeed, should you not marry her?  People say she is pretty, and I know she can be warm.  I have seen her warm and languishing to scores of men.  She is clever, too, with her eyes, is our great Empress; I grant her that.  And as for you, it tickles you to be courted."  "I think you are a very silly woman," I said.  "If you flatter yourself it matters a rap to me whom you marry, you are letting conceit run away with you."  "Listen," I said.  "I did not ask you here to make foolish speeches which seem largely beyond my comprehension.  I asked you to help me do a service to one of your own blood-kin."  She stared at me wonderingly.  "I do not understand."  "It rests largely with you as to whether Nais dies to-morrow, or whether she is thrown into a sleep from which she may waken on some later and more happy day."  "Nais!" she gasped.  "My twin, Nais?  She is not here.  She is out in the camp with those nasty rebels who bite against the city walls, if, indeed, still she lives."  "Nais, your sister is near us in the royal pyramid this minute, and under guard, though where I do not know."  And with that I told her all that had passed since the girl was brought up a prisoner in the galley of that foolish, fawning captain of the port.  "The Empress has decreed that Nais shall be buried alive under a throne of granite which I am to build for her to-morrow, and buried she will assuredly be.  Yet I have a kindness for Nais, which you may guess at if you choose, and I am minded to send her into a sleep such as only we higher priests know of, from which at some future day she may possibly awaken."  "So it is Nais; and not Phorenice, and not--not any other?"  "Yes; it is Nais.  I marry the Empress because Zaemon, who is mouthpiece to the High Council of the Priests, has ordered it, for the good of Atlantis.  But my inwards remain still cold towards her."  "Almost I hate poor Nais already."  "Your vengeance would be easy.  Do not tell me where she is gaoled, and I shall not dare to ask.  Even to give Nais a further span of life I cannot risk making inquiries for her cell, when there is a chance that those who tell me might carry news to the Empress, and so cause more trouble for this poor Atlantis."  "And why should I not carry the news, and so bring myself into favour again?  I tell you that being fan-girl to Phorenice and second woman in the kingdom is a thing that not many would cast lightly aside."  I looked her between eyes and smiled.  "I have no fear there.  You will not betray me, Ylga.  Neither will you sell Nais."  "I seem to remember very small love for this same Nais just now," she said bitterly.  "But you are right about that other matter.  I shall not buy myself back at your expense.  Oh, I am a fool, I know, and you can give me no thanks that I care about, but there is no other way I can act."  "Then let us fritter no more time.  Go you out now and find where Nais is gaoled, and bring me news how I can say ten words to her, and press a certain matter into her clasp."  She bowed her head and left the chamber, and for long enough I was alone.  I sat down on the couch, and rested wearily against the wall.  My bones ached, my eyes ached, and most of all, my inwards ached.  I had thought to myself that a man who makes his life sufficiently busy will find no leisure for these pains which assault frailer folk; but a philosophy like this, which carried one well in Yucatan, showed poorly enough when one tried it here at home.  But that there was duty ahead, and the order of the High Council to be carried into effect, the bleakness of the prospect would have daunted me, and I would have prayed the Gods then to spare me further life, and take me unto Themselves.  Ylga came back at last, and I got up and went quickly after her as she led down a maze of passages and alleyways.  "There has been no care spared over her guarding," she whispered, as we halted once to move a stone.  "The officer of the guard is an old lover of mine, and I raised his hopes to the burning point again by a dozen words.  But when I wanted to see his prisoner, there he was as firm as brass.  I told him she was my sister, but that did not move him.  I offered him--oh, Deucalion, it makes me blush to think of the things I did offer to that man, but there was no stirring him.  He has watched the tormentors so many times, that there is no tempting him into touch of their instruments."  "If you have failed, why bring me out here?"  "Oh, I am not inveigling you into a lover's walk with myself, sir.  You tickle yourself when you think your society is so pleasant as that."  "Come, girl, tell me then what it is.  If my temper is short, credit it against my weariness."  "I have carried out my lord's commands in part.  I know the cell where Nais lives, and I have had speech with her, though not through the door.  And moreover, I have not seen her or touched her hand."  "Your riddles are beyond me, Ylga, but if there is a chance, let us get on and have this business done."  "We are at the place now," said she, with a hard little laugh, "and if you kneel on the floor, you will find an airshaft, and Nais will answer you from the lower end.  For myself, I will leave you.  I have a delicacy in hearing what you want to say to my sister, Deucalion."  "I thank you," I said.  "I will not forget what you have done for me this night."  "You may keep your thanks," she said bitterly, and walked away into the shadows.  I knelt on the floor of the gallery, and found the air passage with my hand, and then, putting my lips to it, whispered for Nais.  The answer came on the instant, muffled and quiet.  "I knew my lord would come for a farewell."  "What the Empress said, has to be.  You understand, my dear?  It is for Atlantis."  "Have I reproached my lord, by word or glance?"  "I myself am bidden to place you in the hollow between the stones, and I must do it."  "Then my last sleep will be a sweet one.  I could not ask to be touched by pleasanter hands."  "But it mayhap that a day will come when she whom you know of will be suffered by the High Gods to live on this land of Atlantis no longer."  "If my lord will cherish my poor memory when he is free again, I shall be grateful.  He might, if he chose, write them on the stones: Here was buried a maid who died gladly for the good of Atlantis, even though she knew that the man she so dearly loved was husband to her murderess."  "You must not die," I whispered.  "My breast is near broken at the very thought of it.  And for respite, we must trust to the ancient knowledge, which in its day has been sent out from the Ark of the Mysteries."--I took the green waxy ball in my fingers, and stretched them down the crooked air-shaft to the full of my span.--"I have somewhat for you here.  Reach up and try to catch it from me."  I heard the faint rustle of her arm as it swept against the masonry, and then the ball was taken over into her grasp.  Gods! what a thrill went through me when the fingers of Nais touched mine!  I could not see her, because of the crookedness of the shaft, but that faint touch of her was exquisite.  "I have it," she whispered.  "And what now, dear?"  "You will hide the thing in your garment, and when to-morrow the upper stone closes down upon you and the light is gone, then you will take it between your lips and let it dissolve as it will.  Sleep will take you, my darling, then, and the High Gods will watch over you, even though centuries pass before you are roused."  "If Deucalion does not wake me, I shall pray never again to open an eye.  And now go, my lord and my dear.  They watch me here constantly, and I would not have you harmed by being brought to notice."  "Yes, I must go, my sweetheart.  It will not do to have our scheme spoiled by a foolish loitering.  May the most High Gods attend your rest, and if the sacrifice we make finds favour, may They grant us meeting here again on earth before we meet--as we must--when our time is done, and They take us up to Their own place."  "Amen," she whispered back, and then: "Kiss your fingers, dear, and thrust them down to me."  I did that, and for an instant felt her fondle them down the crook of the airshaft out of sight, and then heard her withdraw her little hand and kiss it fondly.  Then again she kissed her own fingers and stretched them up, and I took up the virtue of that parting kiss on my finger-tips and pressed it sacredly to my lips.  "Living, sleeping, or dead, always my darling," she whispered.  And then, before I could answer, she whispered again: "Go, they are coming for me."  And so I went, knowing that I could do no more to help her then, and knowing that all our schemes would be spilt if any eye spied upon me as I lay there beside the air shaft.  But my chest was like to have split with the dull, helpless anguish that was in it, as I made my way back to my chamber through the mazy alleys of the pyramid.  "Do not look upon mine eyes, dear, when the time comes," had been her last command, "or they will tell a tale which Phorenice, being a woman, would read.  Remember, we make these small denials, not for our own likings, but for Atlantis, which is mother to us all."    13.  THE BURYING ALIVE OF NAIS   There is no denying that the wishes of Phorenice were carried into quick effect in the city of Atlantis.   Her modern theory was that the country and all therein existed only for the good of the Empress, and when she had a desire, no cost could possibly be too great in its carrying out.  She had given forth her edict concerning the burying alive of Nais, and though the words were that I was to build the throne of stone, it was an understood thing that the manual labour was to be done for me by others.  Heralds made the proclamation in every ward of the city, and masons, labourers, stonecutters, sculptors, engineers, and architects took hands from whatever was occupying them for the moment, and hastened to the rendezvous.  The architects chose a chief who gave directions, and the lesser architects and the engineers saw these carried into effect.  Any material within the walls of the city on which they set their seal, was taken at once without payment or compensation; and as the blocks of stone they chose were the most monstrous that could be got, they were forced to demolish no few buildings to give them passage.  I have before spoken of the modern rage for erecting new palaces and pyramids, and even though at the moment an army of rebels was battering with war engines at the city walls, the building guilds were steadily at work, and their skill (with Phorenice's marvellous invention to aid them) was constantly on the increase.  True, they could not move such massive blocks of stone as those which the early Gods planted for the sacred circle of our Lord the Sun, but they had got rams and trucks and cranes which could handle amazing bulks.  The throne was to be erected in the open square before the royal pyramid.  Seven tiers of stone were there for a groundwork, each a knee-height deep, and each cut in the front with three steps.  In the uppermost layer was a cavity made to hold the body of Nais, and above this was poised the vast block which formed the seat of the throne itself.  Throughout the night, to the light of torches, relay after relay of the stonecutters, and the masons, and the sweating labourers had toiled over bringing up the stone and dressing it into fit shape, and laying it in due position; and the engineers had built machines for lifting, and the architects had proved that each stone lay in its just and perfect place.  Whips cracked, and men fainted with the labour, but so soon as one was incapable another pressed forward into his place.  No delay was brooked when Phorenice had said her wish.  And finally, as the square began to fill with people come to gape at the pageant of to-day, the chippings and the scaffolding were cleared away, and with it the bodies of some half-score of workmen who had died from accidents or their exertions during the building, and there stood the throne, splendid in its carvings, and all ready for completion.  The lower part stood more than two man-heights above the ground, and no stone of its courses weighed less than twenty men; the upper part was double the weight of any of these, and was carved so that the royal snake encircled the chair, and the great hooded head overshadowed it.  But at present the upper part was not on its bed, being held up high by lifting rams, for what purposes all men knew.  It was to face this scene, then, that I came out from the royal pyramid at the summons of the chamberlains in the cool of next morning.  Each great man who had come there before me had banner- bearers and trumpeters to proclaim his presence; the middle classes were in all their bravery of apparel; and even poor squalid creatures, with ribs of hunger showing through their dusty skins, had turbans and wisps of colour wrapped about their heads to mark the gaiety of the day.  The trumpets proclaimed my coming, and the people shouted welcome, and with the gorgeous chamberlains walking backwards in advance, I went across to a scarlet awning that had been prepared, and took my seat upon the cushions beneath it.  And then came Phorenice, my bride that was to be that day, fresh from sleep, and glorious in her splendid beauty.  She was borne out from the pyramid in an open litter of gold and ivory by fantastic savages from Europe, her own refinement of feature being thrown up into all the higher relief by contrast with their brutish ugliness.  One could hear the people draw a deep breath of delight as their eyes first fell upon her; and it is easy to believe there was not a man in that crowd which thronged the square who did not envy me her choice, nor was there a soul present (unless Ylga was there somewhere veiled) who could by any stretch imagine that I was not overjoyed in winning so lovely a wife.  For myself, I summoned up all the iron of my training to guard the expression of my face.  We were here on ceremonial to-day; a ghastly enough affair throughout all its acts, if you choose, but still ceremonial; and I was minded to show Phorenice a grand manner that would leave her nothing to cavil at.  After all that had been gone through and endured, I did not intend a great scheme to be shattered by letting my agony and pain show themselves, in either a shaking hand or a twitching cheek.  When it came to the point, I told myself, I would lay the living body of my love in the hollow beneath the stone as calmly, and with as little outward emotion, as though I had been a mere priest carrying out the burial of some dead stranger.  And she, on her part, would not, I knew, betray our secret.  With her, too, it was truly "Before all Atlantis."  I think it spared a pang to find that there was to be no mockery or flippancy in what went forward.  All was solemn and impressive; and, though a certain grandeur and sombreness which bit deep into my breast was lost to the vulgar crowd, I fancy that the outward shape of the double sacrifice they witnessed that day would not be forgotten by any of them, although the inner meaning of it all was completely hidden from their minds.  When it suited her fancy, none could be more strict on the ritual of a ceremony than this many-mooded Empress, and it appeared that on this occasion she had given command that all things were to be carried out with the rigid exactness and pomp of the older manner.  So she was borne up by her Europeans to the scarlet awning, and I handed her to the ground.  She seated herself on the cushions, and beckoned me to her side, entwining her fingers with mine as has always been the custom with rulers of Atlantis and their consorts.  And there before us as we sat, a body of soldiery marched up, and opening out showed Nais in their midst.  She had a collar of metal round her neck, with chains depending from it firmly held by a brace of guards, so that she should not run in upon the spears of the escort, and thus get a quick and easy death, which is often the custom of those condemned to the more lingering punishments.  But it was pleasant to see that she still wore her clothing.  Raiment, whether of fabric or skin, has its value, and custom has always given the garments of the condemned to the soldiers guarding them.  So as Nais was not stripped, I could not but see that some one had given moneys to the guards as a recompense, and in this I thought I saw the hand of Ylga, and felt a gratitude towards her.  The soldiers brought her forward to the edge of the pavilion's shade, and she was bidden prostrate herself before the Empress, and this she wisely did and so avoided rough handling and force.  Her face was pale, but showed neither fear nor defiance, and her eyes were calm and natural.  She was remembering what was due to Atlantis, and I was thrilled with love and pride as I watched her.  But outwardly I, too, was impassive as a man of stone, and though I knew that Phorenice's eye was on my face, there was never anything on it from first to last that I would not have had her see.  "Nais," said the Empress, "you have eaten from my platter when you were fan-girl, and drunk from my cup, and what was yours I gave you.  You should have had more than gratitude, you should have had knowledge also that the arm of the Empress was long and her hand consummately heavy.  But it seems that you have neither of these things.  And, moreover, you have tried to take a certain matter that the Empress has set apart for herself.  You were offered pardon, on terms, and you rejected it.  You were foolish.  But it is a day now when I am inclined to clemency.  Presently, seated on that carved throne of granite which he has built me yonder, I shall take my Lord Deucalion to husband.  Give me a plain word that you are sorry, girl, and name a man whom you would choose, and I will remember the brightness of the occasion, you shall be pardoned and wed before we rise from these cushions."  "I will not wed," she said quietly.  "Think for the last time, Nais, of what is the other choice.  You will be taken, warm, and quick, and beautiful as you stand there this minute, and laid in the hollow place that is made beneath the throne-stone.  Deucalion, that is to be my husband, will lay you in that awful bed, as a symbol that so shall perish all Phorenice's enemies, and then he will release the rams and lower the upper stone into place, and the world shall see your face no more.  Look at the bright sky, Nais, fill your chest with the sweet warm air, and then think of what this death will mean.  Believe me, girl, I do not want to make you an example unless you force me."  "I will not wed," said the prisoner quietly.    The Empress loosed her fingers from my arm, and lay back against the cushions.  "If the girl presumes on our old familiarity, or thinks that I jest, show her now, Deucalion, that I do not."  "The Empress is far from jesting," I said.  "I will do this thing because it is the wish of the Empress that it should be done, and because it is the command of the Empress that a symbol of it shall remain for ever as an example for others.  Lead your prisoner to the place."  The soldiers wheeled, and the two guards with the chains of the collar which was on the neck of Nais prepared to put out force to drag her up the steps.  But she walked with them willingly, and with a colour unchanged, and I rose from my seat, and made obeisance to the Empress and followed them.  Before all those ten thousand eyes, we two made no display of emotion then, not only for Atlantis' sake, but also because both Nais and I had a nicety and a pride in our natures.  We were not as Phorenice to flaunt endearments before others.  Yet, when I had bidden the guards unhasp the collar which held the prisoner's neck, and clapped my arms around her, showing all the roughness of one who has no mind that his captive shall escape or even unduly struggle, a thrill gushed through me so potent that I was like to have fainted, and it was only by supreme strain of will that I held unbrokenly on with the ceremonial.  I, who had never embraced a woman with aught but the arm of roughness before, now held pressed to me one whom I loved with an infinite tenderness, and the revelation of how love can come out and link with love was almost my undoing.  Yet, outwardly, Nais made so sign, but lay half-strangled in my arms, as any woman does that is being borne away by a spoiler.  I trod with her to the uppermost step, the vast throne-stone overhanging us, and then so that all of those who were gazing from the sides of the pyramids and the roofs of the buildings round might see, though we were beyond Phorenice's view, I used a force that was brutal in dragging her across the level, and putting her down into the hollow.  And yet the girl resisted me with no one effort whatever.  So that the victim might not struggle out and be crushed, and so gain an easy death when the stone descended, there were brazen clamps to fit into grooves of the stones above the hollow where she lay, and these I fitted in place above her, and fastened one by one, doing this butcher's work with one hand, and still fiercely holding her down by the other.  Gods! and the sweat of agony dripped from me on to the thirsty stone as I worked.  I could not keep that in.  I clamped and locked the last two bars in place, and took my brute's hand away from her throat.  The hateful fingermarks showed as bloodless furrows in the whiteness of her skin.  For the life of me, yes, even for the fate of Atlantis, I could not help dropping my glance upon her face.  But she was stronger than I.  She gave me no last look.  She kept her eyes steadfastly fixed on the cruel stone above, and so I left her, knowing that it was best not to tarry longer.  I came out from under the stone, and gave the sign to the engineers who stood by the rams.  The fires were taken away from their sides, and the metal in them began to contract, and slowly the vast bulk of the throne-stone began to creep down towards its bed.  But ah, so slowly!  Gods! how my soul was torn as I watched and waited.  Yet I kept my face impassive, overlooking as any officer might a piece of work which others were carrying out under his direction, and on which his credit rested; and I stood gravely in my place till the rams had let the stone come down on its final resting place, and had been carried away by the engineers; and then I went round with the master architect with his plumbline and level, whilst he tested this last piece of the building and declared it perfect.  It was a useless form, this last, seeing that by calculation they knew exactly how the stone must rest; but the guilds have their forms and customs, and on these occasions of high ceremonial, they are punctiliously carried out, because these middle-class people wish always to appear mysterious and impressive to the poor vulgar folk who are their inferiors.  But perhaps I am hard there on them.  A man who is needlessly taken round to plumb and duly level the tomb where his love lies buried living, may perhaps be excused by the assessors on high a little spirit of bitterness.  I had gone up the steps to do my hateful work a man full of grief, though outwardly unmoved.  As I came down again I had a feeling of incompleteness; it seemed as though half my inwards had been left behind with Nais in the hollow of the stone, and their place was taken by a void which ached wearily; but still I carried a passive face, and memory that before all these private matters stood the command of the High Council, which sat before the Ark of the Mysteries.  So I went and stood before Phorenice, and said the words which the ancient forms prescribed concerning the carrying out of her wish.  "Then, now," she said, "I will give myself to you as wife.  We are not as others, you and I, Deucalion.  There is a law and a form set down for the marrying of these other people, but that would be useless for our purposes.  We will have neither priest nor scribe to join us and set down the union.  I am the law here in Atlantis, and you soon will be part of me.  We will not be demeaned by profaner hands.  We will make the ceremony for ourselves, and for witnesses, there are sufficient in waiting.  Afterwards, the record shall be cut deep in the granite throne you have built for me, and the lettering filled in with gold, so that it shall endure and remain bright for always."  "The Empress can do no wrong," I said formally, and took the hand she offered me, and helped her to rise.  We walked out from the scarlet awning into the glare of the sunshine, she leaning on me, flushing, and so radiantly lovely that the people began to hail her with rapturous shouts of "A Goddess; our Goddess Phorenice."  But for me they had no welcoming word.   I think the set grimness of my face both scared and repelled them.  We went up the steps which led to the throne, the people still shouting, and I sat her in the royal seat beneath the snake's outstretched head, and she drew me down to sit beside her.  She raised her jewelled hand, and a silence fell on that great throng, as though the breath had been suddenly cut short for all of them.  Then Phorenice made proclamation:  "Hear me, O my people, and hear me, O High Gods from whom I am come.  I take this man Deucalion, to be my husband, to share with me the prosperity of Atlantis, and join me in guarding our great possession.  May all our enemies perish as she is now perishing above whom we sit."  And then she put her arms around my neck, and kissed me hotly on the mouth.  In turn I also spoke: "Hear me, O most High Gods, whose servant I am, and hear me also, O ye people.  I take this Empress, Phorenice, to wife, to help with her the prosperity of Atlantis, and join with her in guarding the welfare of that great possession.  May all the enemies of this country perish as they have perished in the past."  And then, I too, who had not been permitted by the fate to touch the lips of my love, bestowed the first kiss I had ever given woman to Phorenice, that was now being made my wife.  But we were not completely linked yet.  "A woman is one, and man is one," she proclaimed, following for the first time the old form of words, "but in marriage they merge, so that wife and husband are no more separate, but one conjointly.  In token of this we will now make the symbolic joining together, so that all may see and remember."  She took her dagger, and pricking the brawn on my forearm till a head of blood appeared, set her red lips to it, and took it into herself.  "Ah," she said, with her eyes sparkling, "now you are part of me indeed, Deucalion, and I feel you have strengthened me already."  She pulled down the neck of her robe.  "Let me make you my return."  I pricked the rounded whiteness of her shoulder.  Gods! when I remembered who was beneath us as we sat on that throne, I could have driven the blade through to her heart!  And then I, too, put down my lips, and took the drop of her blood that was yielded to me.  My tongue was dry, my throat was parched, and my face suffused, and I thought I should have choked.  But the Empress, who was ordinarily so acute, was misled then.  "It thrills you?" she cried.  "It burns within you like living fire?  I have just felt it.  By my face!  Deucalion, if I had known the pleasure it gives to be made a wife, I do not think I should have waited this long for you.  Ah, yes; but with another man I should have had no thrill.  I might have gone through the ceremony with another, but it would have left me cold.  Well, they say this feeling comes to a woman but once in her time, and I would not change it for the glory of all my conquests and the whirl of all my power."  She leaned in close to me so that the red curls of her hair swept my cheek, and her breath came hot against my mouth.  "Tasted you ever any sweet so delicious as this knowledge that we are made one now, Deucalion, past all possible dissolving?"  I could not lie to her any more just then.  The Gods know how honestly I had striven to play the part commanded me for Atlantis' good, but there is a limit to human endurance, and mine was reached.  I was not all anger towards her.  I had some pity for this passion of hers, which had grown of itself certainly, but which I had done nothing to check; and the indecent frankness with which it was displayed was only part of the livery of potentates who flaunt what meaner folk would coyly hide.  But always before my eyes was a picture of the girl on whom her jealousy had taken such a bitter vengeance, and to invent spurious lover's talk then was a thing my tongue refused to do.  "Words are poor things," I said, "and I am a man unused to women, and have but a small stock of any phrases except the dryest.  Remember, Phorenice, a week agone, I did not know what love was, and now that I have learned the lesson, somewhat of the suddenest, the language remains still to come to me.  My inwards speak; indeed they are full of speech; but I cannot translate into bald cold words what they say."  And here, surely the High Gods took pity on my tied tongue and my misery, and made an opportunity for bringing the ceremony to an end.  A man ran into the square shouting, and showing a wound that dripped, and presently all that vast crowd which stood on the pavements, and the sides of the pyramids, and the roofs of the temples, took up the cry, and began to feel for their weapons.  "The rebels are in!"  "They have burrowed a path into the city!"  "They have killed the cave-tigers and taken a gate!"  "They are putting the whole place to the storm!"  "They will presently leave no poor soul of us here alive!"  There then was a termination of our marriage cooings.  With rebels merely biting at the walls, it was fine to put strong trust in the defences, and easy to affect contempt for the besiegers' powers, and to keep the business of pageants and state craft and marryings turning on easy wheels.  But with rebel soldiers already inside the city (and hordes of others doubtless pressing on their heels), the affairs took a different light.  It was no moment for further delay, and Phorenice was the first to admit it.  The glow that had been in her eyes changed to the glare of the fighter, as the fellow who had run up squalled out his tidings.  I stood and stretched my chest.  I seemed in need of air.  "Here," I said, "is work that I can understand more clearly.  I will go and sweep this rabble back to their burrows, Phorenice."  "But not alone, sir.  I come too.  It is my city still.  Nay, sir, we are too newly wed to be parted yet."  "Have your will," I said, and together we went down the steps of the throne to the pavement below.  Under my breath I said a farewell to Nais.  Our armour-bearers met us with weapons, and we stepped into litters, and the slaves took us off hot foot.  The wounded man who had first brought the news had fallen in a faint, and no more tidings was to be got from him, but the growing din of the fight gave us the general direction, and presently we began to meet knots of people who dwelt near the place of irruption, running away in wild panic, loaded down with their household goods.  It was useless to stop these, as fight they could not, and if they had stayed they would merely have been slaughtered like flies, and would in all likelihood have impeded our own soldiery.  And so we let them run screaming on their blind way, but forced the litters through them with but very little regard for their coward convenience.  Now the advantage of the rebels, when it came to be looked upon by a soldier's eye, was a thing of little enough importance.  They had driven a tunnel from behind a covering mound, beneath the walls, and had opened it cleverly enough through the floor of a middle-class house.  They had come through into this, collecting their numbers under its shelter, and doubtless hoping that the marriage of the Empress (of which spies had given them information) would sap the watchfulness of the city guards.  But it seems they were discovered and attacked before they were thoroughly ready to emerge, and, as a fine body of troops were barracked near the spot, their extermination would have been merely a matter of time, even if we had not come up.  It did not take a trained eye long to decide on this, and Phorenice, with a laugh, lay back on the cushions of the litter, and returned her weapons to the armour-bearer who came panting up to receive them.  "We grow nervous with our married life, my Deucalion," she said.  "We are fearful lest this new-found happiness be taken from us too suddenly."  But I was not to be robbed of my breathing-space in this wise.  "Let me crave a wedding gift of you," I said.  "It is yours before you name it."  "Then give me troops, and set me wide a city gate a mile away from here."  "You can gather five hundred as you go from here to the gate, taking two hundred of those that are here.  If you want more, they must be fetched from other barracks along the walls.  But where is your plan?"  "Why, my poor strategy teaches me this: these foolish rebels have set all their hopes on this mine, and all their excitement on its present success.  If they are kept occupied here by a Phorenice, who will give them some dainty fighting without checking them unduly, they will press on to the attack and forget all else, and never so much as dream of a sortie.  And meanwhile, a Deucalion with his troop will march out of the city well away from here, without tuck of drum or blare of trumpet, and fall most unpleasantly upon their rear.  After which, a Phorenice will burn the house here at the mine's head, which is of wood, and straw thatched, to discourage further egress, and either go to the walls to watch the fight from there, or sally out also and spur on the rout as her fancy dictates."  "Your scheme is so pretty, I would I could rob you of it for my own credit's sake, and as it is, I must kiss you for your cleverness.  But you got my word first, you naughty fellow, and you shall have the men and do as you ask.  Eh, sir, this is a sad beginning of our wedded life, if you begin to rob your little wife of all the sweets of conquest from the outset."  She took back the weapons and target she had given to the armour-bearer, and stepped over the side of the litter to the ground.  "But at least," she said, "if you are going to fight, you shall have troops that will do credit to my drill," and thereupon proceeded to tell off the companies of men-at-arms who were to accompany me. She left herself few enough to stem the influx of rebels who poured ceaselessly in through the tunnel; but as I had seen, with Phorenice, heavy odds added only to her enjoyment.  But for the Empress, I will own at the time to have given little enough of thought.  My own proper griefs were raw within me, and I thirsted for that forgetfulness of all else which battle gives, so that for awhile I might have a rest from their gnawings.  It made my blood run freer to hear once more the tramp of practised troops behind me, and when all had been collected, we marched out through a gate of the city, and presently were charging through and through the straggling rear of the enemy.  By the Gods! for the moment even Nais was blotted from my wearied mind.  Never had I loved more to let my fierceness run madly riot.  Never have I gloated more abundantly over the terrible joy of battle.  Nais must forgive my weakness in seeking to forget her even for a breathing-space.  Had that opportunity been denied me, I believe the agony of remembering would have snapped my brain-strings for always.    14.  AGAIN THE GODS MAKE CHANGE   Now it would be tedious to tell how with a handful of highly trained fighting men, I charged and recharged, and finally broke up that horde of rebels which outnumbered us by fifteen times.  It must be remembered that they grew suddenly panic-stricken in finding that of all those who went in under the city walls by the mine on which they had set such great store, none came back, and that the sounds of panic which had first broken out within the city soon gave way to cries of triumph and joy.  And it must be carried in memory also that these wretched rebels were without training worthy of the name, were for the most part weaponed very vilely, and, seeing that their silly principles made each the equal of his neighbour, were practically without heads or leaders also.  So when the panic began, it spread like a malignant murrain through all their ragged ranks, and there were none to rally the flying, none to direct those of more desperate bravery who stayed and fought.  My scheme of attack was simple.  I hunted them without a halt.  I and my fellows never stopped to play the defensive.  We turned one flank, and charged through a centre, and then we were harrying the other flank, and once more hacking our passage through the solid mass.  And so by constantly keeping them on the run, and in ignorance of whence would come the next attack, panic began to grow amongst them and ferment, till presently those in the outer lines commenced to scurry away towards the forests and the spoiled corn-lands of the country, and those in the inner packs were only wishful of a chance to follow them.  It was no feat of arms this breaking up of the rebel leaguer, and no practised soldier would wish to claim it as such.  It was simply taking advantage of the chances of the moment, and as such it was successful.  Given an open battle on their own ground, these desperate rebels would have fought till none could stand, and by sheer ferocious numbers would have pulled down any trained troops that the city could have sent against them, whether they had advanced in phalanx or what formation you will.  For it must be remembered they were far removed from cowards, being Atlantean all, just as were those within the city, and were, moreover, spurred to extraordinary savageness and desperation by the oppression under which they had groaned, and the wrongs they had been forced to endure.  Still, as I say, the poor creatures were scattered, and the siege was raised from that moment, and it was plain to see that the rebellion might be made to end, if no unreasonable harshness was used for its final suppression.  Too great severity, though perhaps it may be justly their portion, only drives such malcontents to further desperations.  Now, following up these fugitives, to make sure that there was no halt in their retreat, and to send the lesson of panic thoroughly home to them, had led us a long distance from the city walls; and as we had fought all through the burning heat of the day and my men were heavily wearied, I decided to halt where we were for the night amongst some half-ruined houses which would make a temporary fortification.  Fortunately, a drove of little cloven-hoofed horses which had been scared by some of the rebels in their flight happened to blunder into our lines, and as we killed five before they were clear again, there was a soldier's supper for us, and quickly the fires were lit and cooking it.  Sentries paced the outskirts and made their cries to one another, and the wounded sat by the fires and dressed their hurts, and with the officers I talked over the engagements of the day, and the methods of each charge, and the other details of the fighting.  It is the special perquisite of soldiers to dally over these matters with gusto, though they are entirely without interest for laymen.  The hour drew on for sleep, and snores went up from every side.  It was clear that all my officers were wearied out, and only continued the talk through deference to their commander.  Yet I had a feverish dread of being left alone again with my thoughts, and pressed them on with conversation remorselessly.  But in the end they were saved the rudeness of dropping off into unconsciousness during my talk.  A sentry came up and saluted.  "My lord," he reported.  "there is a woman come up from the city whom we have caught trying to come into the bivouac."  "How is she named?"  "She will not say."  "Has she business?'  "She will say none.  She demands only to see my lord."  "Bring her here to the fire," I ordered, and then on second thoughts remembering that the woman, whoever she might be, had news likely enough for my private ear (or otherwise she would not have come to so uncouth a rendezvous), I said to the sentry: "Stay," and got up from the ground beside the fire, and went with him to the outer line.  "Where is she?" I asked.  "My comrades are holding her.  She might be a wench belonging to these rebels, with designs to put a knife into my lord's heart, and then we sentries would suffer.  The Empress," he added simply, "seems to set good store upon my lord at present, and we know the cleverness of her tormentors."  "Your thoughtfulness is frank," I said, and then he showed me the woman.  She was muffled up in hood and cloak, but one who loved Nais as I loved could not mistake the form of Ylga, her twin sister, because of mere swathings.  So I told the sentries to release her without asking her for speech, and then led her out from the bivouac beyond earshot of their lines.  "It is something of the most pressing that has brought you out here, Ylga?"  "You know me, then?  There must be something warmer than the ordinary between us two, Deucalion, if you could guess who walked beneath all these mufflings."  I let that pass.  "But what's your errand, girl?"  "Aye," she said bitterly, "there's my reward.  All your concern's for the message, none for the carrier.  Well, good my lord, you are husband to the dainty Phorenice no longer."  "This is news."  "And true enough, too.  She will have no more of you, divorces you, spurns you, thrusts you from her, and, after the first splutter of wrath is done, then come pains and penalties."  "The Empress can do no wrong.  I will have you speak respectful words of the Empress."  "Oh, be done with that old fable!  It sickens me.  The woman was mad for love of you, and now she's mad with jealousy.  She knows that you gave Nais some of your priest's magic, and that she sleeps till you choose to come and claim her, even though the day be a century from this.  And if you wish to know the method of her enlightenment, it is simple.  There is another airshaft next to the one down which you did your cooing and billing, and that leads to another cell in which lay another prisoner.  The wretch heard all that passed, and thought to buy enlargement by telling it.  "But his news came a trifle stale.  It seems that with the pressure of the morning's ceremonies, they forgot to bring a ration, and when at last his gaoler did remember him, it was rather late, seeing that by then Phorenice had tied herself publicly to a husband, and poor Nais had doubtless eaten her green drug.  However, the fools must needs try and barter his tale for what it would fetch; and, as was natural, had such a silly head chopped off for his pains; and after that your Phorenice behaved as you may guess.  And now you may thank me, sir, for coming to warn you not to go back to Atlantis."  "But I shall go back.  And if the Empress chooses to cut my head also from its proper column, that is as the High Gods will."  "You are more sick of life than I thought.  But I think, sir, our Phorenice judges your case very accurately.  It was permitted me to hear the outbursting of this lady's rage.  'Shall I hew off his head?' said she.  'Pah!  Shall I give him over to my tormentors, and stand by whilst they do their worst?  He would not wrinkle his brow at their fiercest efforts.  No; he must have a heavier punishment than any of these, and one also which will endure.  I shall lop off his right hand and his left foot, so that he may be a fighting man no longer, and then I shall drive him forth crippled into the dangerous lands, where he may learn Fear.  The beasts shall hunt him, the fires of the ground shall spoil his rest.  He shall know hunger, and he shall breathe bad air.  And all the while he shall remember that I have Nais near me, living and locked in her coffin of stone, to play with as I choose, and to give over to what insults may come to my fancy.' That is what she said, Deucalion.  Now I ask you again will you go back to meet her vengeance?"  "No," I said, "it is no part of my plan to be mutilated and left to live."  "So, being a woman of some sense, I judged.  And, moreover, having some small kindness still left for you, I have taken it upon myself to make a plan for your further movement which may fall in with your whim.  Does the name of Tob come back to your memory?"  "One who was Captain of Tatho's navy?"  "That same Tob.  A gruff, rude fellow, and smelling vile of tar, but seeming to have a sturdy honesty of his own.  Tob sails away this night for parts unknown, presumably to found a kingdom with Tob for king.  It seems he can find little enough to earn at his craft in Atlantis these latter days, and has scruples at seeing his wife and young ones hungry.  He told me this at the harbour side when I put my neck under the axe by saying I wanted carriage for you, sir, and so having me under his thumb, he was perhaps more loose-lipped than usual.  You seem to have made a fine impression on Tob, Deucalion.  He said--I repeat his hearty disrespect--you were just the recruit he wanted, but whether you joined him or not, he would go to the nether Gods to do you service."  "By the fellow's side, I gained some experience in fighting the greater sea beasts."  "Well, go and do it again.  Believe me, sir, it is your only chance.  It would grieve me much to hear the searing-iron hiss on your stumps.  I bargained with Tob to get clear of the harbour forts before the chain was up for the night, and as he is a very daring fellow, with no fear of navigating under the darkness, he himself said he would come to a point of the shore which we agreed upon, and there await you.  Come, Deucalion, let me lead you to the place."  "My girl," I said, "I see I owe you many thanks for what you have done on my poor behalf."  "Oh, your thanks!" she said.  "You may keep them.  I did not come out here in the dark and the dangers for mere thanks, though I knew well enough there would be little else offered."--She plucked at my sleeve.--"Now show me your walking pace, sir.  They will begin to want your countenance in the camp directly, and we need hanker after no too narrow inquiries for what's along."  So thereon we set off, Ylga and I, leaving the lights of the bivouac behind us, and she showed the way, whilst I carried my weapons ready to ward off attacks whether from beasts or from men.  Few words were passed between us, except those which had concern with the dangers natural to the way.  Once only did we touch one another, and that was where a tree-trunk bridged a rivulet of scalding water which flowed from a boil-spring towards the sea.  "Are you sure of footing?" I asked, for the night was dark, and the heat of the water would peel the flesh from the bones if one slipped into it.  "No," she said, "I am not," and reached out and took my hand.  I helped her over and then loosed my grip, and she sighed, and slowly slipped her hand away.  Then on again we went in silence, side by side, hour after hour, and league after league.  But at last we topped a rise, and below us through the trees I could see the gleam of the great estuary on which the city of Atlantis stands.  The ground was soggy and wet beneath us, the trees were full of barbs and spines, the way was monstrous hard.  Ylga's breath was beginning to come in laboured pants.  But when I offered to take her arm, and help her, as some return against what she had done for me, she repulsed me rudely enough.  "I am no poor weakling," said she, "if that is your only reason for wanting to touch me."  Presently, however, we came out through the trees, and the roughest part of our journey was done.  We saw the ship riding to her anchors in shore a mile away, and a weird enough object she was under the faint starlight.  We made our way to her along the level beaches.  Tob was keeping a keen watch.  We were challenged the moment we came within stone or arrow shot, and bidden to halt and recite our business; but he was civil enough when he heard we were those whom he expected.  He called a crew and slacked out his anchor-rope till his ship ground against the shingle, and then thrust out his two steering oars to help us clamber aboard.  I turned to Ylga with words of thanks and farewell.  "I will never forget what you have done for me this night; and should the High Gods see fit to bring me back to Atlantis and power, you shall taste my gratitude."  "I do not want to return.  I am sick of this old life here."  "But you have your palace in the city, and your servants, and your wealth, and Phorenice will not disturb you from their possession."  "Oh, as for that, I could go back and be fan-girl tomorrow.  But I do not want to go back."  "Let me tell you it is no time for a gently nurtured lady like yourself to go forward.  I have been viceroy of Yucatan, Ylga, and know somewhat of making a foothold in these new countries.  And that was nothing compared with what this will be.  I tell you it entails hardships, and privations, and sufferings which you could not guess at.  Few survive who go to colonise in the beginning, and those only of the hardiest, and they earn new scars and new batterings every day."  "I do not care, and, besides, I can share the work.  I can cook, I can shoot a good arrow, and I can make garments, yes, though they were cut from the skins of beasts and had to be sewn with backbone sinews.  Because you despise fine clothes, and because you have seen me only decked out as fan-girl, you think I am useless.  Bah, Deucalion!  Never let people prate to me about your perfection.  You know less about a woman than a boy new from school."  "I have learned all I care to know about one woman, and because of the memory of her, I could not presume to ask her sister to come with me now."  "Aye," she said bitterly, "kick my pride.  I knew well enough it was only second place to Nais I could get all the time I was wanting to come.  Yet no one but a boor would have reminded me of it.  Gods! and to think that half the men in Atlantis have courted me, and now I am arrived at this!"  "I must go alone.  It would have made me happier to take your esteem with me.  But as it is, I suppose I shall carry only your hate."  "That is the most humiliating thing of all; I cannot bring myself to hate you.  I ought to, I know, after the brutal way you have scorned me.  But I do not, and there is the truth.  I seem to grow the fonder of you, and if I thought there was a way of keeping you alive, and unmutilated, here in Atlantis, I do not think I should point out that Tob is tired of waiting, and will probably be off without you."  She flung her arms suddenly about my neck, and kissed me hotly on the mouth.  "There, that is for good-bye, dear.  You see I am reckless.  I care not what I do now, knowing that you cannot despise me more than you have done all along for my forwardness."  She ran back from me into the edge of the trees.  "But this is foolishness," I said.  "I must take you through the dangers that lie between here and some gate of the city, and then come back to the ship."  "You need not fear for me.  The unhappy are always safe.  And, besides, I have a way.  It is my solace to know that you will remember me now.  You will never forget that kiss."  "Fare you well, Ylga," I cried.  "May the High Gods keep you entirely in their holy care."  But no reply came back.  She had gone off into the forest.  And so I turned down to the beach, and splashed into the water, and climbed on board the ship up the steering oars.  Tob gave the word to haul-to the anchor, and get her away from the beach.  "Greeting, my lord," said he, "but I'd have been pleased to see you earlier.  We've small enough force and slow enough heels in this vessel, and it's my idea that the sooner we're away from here and beyond range of pursuit, the safer it will be for my woman and brats who are in that hutch of an after-castle.  It's long enough since I sailed in such a small old-fashioned ship as this.  She's no machines, and she's not even a steering mannikin.  Look at the meanness of her furniture and (in your ear) I've suspicions that there's rottenness in her bottom.  But she's the best I'd the means to buy, and if she reaches the place at the farther end I've got my eye on, we shall have to make a home there, or be content to die, for she'll never have strength to carry us farther or back.  She's been a ship in the Egypt trade, and you know what that is for getting worm and rot in the wood."  "You'd enough hands for your scheme before I came?"  "Oh yes.  I've fifty stout lads and eight women packed in the ship somehow, and trouble enough I've had to get them away from the city.  That thief of a port-captain wellnigh skinned us clean before he could see it lawful that so many useful fighting men might go out of harbour.  Times are not what they were, I tell you, and the sea trade's about done.  All sailor men of any skill have taken a woman or two and gone out in companies to try their fortunes in other lands.  Why, I'd trouble enough to get half a score to help me work this ship.  All my balance are just landsmen raw and simple, and if I land half of them alive at the other end, we shall be doing well."  "Still with luck and a few good winds it should not take long to get across to Europe."  Tob slapped his leg.  "No savage Europe for me, my lord.  Now, see the advantage of being a mariner.  I found once some islands to the north of Europe, separated from the main by a strait, which I called the Tin Islands, seeing that tin ore litters many of the beaches.  I was driven there by storm, and said no word of the find when I got back, and here you see it comes in useful.  There's no one in all Atlantis but me knows of those Tin Islands to-day, and we'll go and fight honestly for our ground, and build a town and a kingdom on it."  "With Tob for king?"  "Well, I have figured it out as such for many a day, but I know when I meet my better, and I'm content to serve under Deucalion.  My lord would have done wiser to have brought a wife with him, though, and I thought it was understood by the good lady that spoke to me down at the harbour, or I'd have mentioned it earlier.  The savages in my Tin Islands go naked and stain themselves blue with woad, and are very filthy and brutish to look upon.  They are sturdy, and should make good slaves, but one would have to get blunted in the taste before one could wish to be father to their children."  "I am still husband to Phorenice."  Tob grinned.  "The Gods give you joy of her.  But it is part of a mariner's creed--and you will grow to be a mariner here--that wedlock does not hold across the seas.  However, that matter may rest.  But, coming to my Tin Islands again: they'll delight you.  And I tell you, a kingdom will not be so hard to carve out as it was in Egypt, or as you found in Yucatan.  There are beasts there, of course, and no one who can hunt need ever go hungry.  But the greater beasts are few.  There are cave-bears and cave-tigers in small numbers, to be sure, and some river-horses and great snakes.  But the greater lizards seem to avoid the land; and as for birds, there is rarely seen one that can hurt a grown man.  Oh, I tell you, it will be a most desirable kingdom."  "Tob seems to have imagined himself king of the Tin Islands with much reality."  He sighed a little.  "In truth I did, and there is no denying it, and I tell you plain, there is not another man living that I would have broken this voyage for but Deucalion.  But don't think I regret it, and don't think I want to push myself above my place.  This breeze and the ebb are taking the old ship finely along her ways.  See those fire baskets on the harbour forts?  We're abreast of them now.  We'll have dropped them and the city out of sight by daylight, and the flood will not begin to run up till then.  But I fear unless the wind hardens down with the dawn we'll have to bring up to an anchor when the flood makes.  Tides run very hard in these narrow seas.  Aye, and there are some shrewdish tide-rips round my Tin Islands, as you shall see when we reach them."  There were many fearful glances backwards when day came and showed the waters, and the burning mountains that hemmed them in beyond the shores.  All seemed to expect some navy of Phorenice to come surging up to take them back to servitude and starvation in the squalid wards of the city; and I confess ingenuously that I was with them in all truth when they swore they would fight the ship till she sank beneath them, before they would obey another of the commands of Phorenice.  However, their brave heroics were displayed to no small purpose.  For the full flow of the tide we hung in our place, barely moving past the land, but yet not seeing either oar or sail; and then, when the tide turned, away we went once more with speed, mightily comforted.  Tob's woman must needs bring drink on deck, and bid all pour libations to her as a future queen.  But Tob cuffed her back into the after-castle, slamming to the hatch behind her heels, and bidding the crew send the liquor down their dusty throats.  "We are done with that foolery," said he.  "My Lord Deucalion will be king of this new kingdom we shall build in the Tin Islands, and a right proper king he'll make, as you untravelled ones would know, if you'd sailed the outer seas with him as I have done."  Beneath which I read a regret, but said nothing, having made my plans from the moment of stepping on board, as will appear on a later sheet.  So on down the great estuary we made our way, and though it pleasured the others on board when they saw that the seas were desolate of sails, it saddened me when I recalled how once the waters had been whitened with the glut of shipping.  They had started off on their voyage with a bare two days' provision in their equipment, and so, of necessity even after leaving the great estuary, we were forced to voyage coastwise, putting into every likely river and sheltered beach to slay fish and meat for future victualling.  "And when the winter comes," said Tob, "as its gales will be heavier than this old ship can stomach, I had determined to haul up and make a permanent camp ashore, and get a crop of grain grown and threshed before setting sail again.  It is the usual custom in these voyages.  And I shall do it still, subject to my lord's better opinion."  So here, having by this time completed a two months' leisurely journey from the city, I saw my opportunity to speak what I had always carried in my mind.  "Tob," I said, "I am a poor, weak, defenceless man, and I am quite at your mercy, but what if I do not voyage all the way to the Tin Islands, and oust you of this kingship?"  He brightened perceptibly.  "Aye," he grunted, "you are very weak, my lord, and mighty defenceless.  We know all about that.  But what's else?  You must tell all your meaning plain.  I'm a common mariner, and understand little of your fancy talk."  "Why, this.  That it is not my wish to leave the continent of Atlantis.  If you will put me down on any part of this side that faces Europe, I will commend you strongly to the Gods.  I would I could give you money, or (better still) articles that would be useful to you in your colonising; but as it is, you see me destitute."  "As to that, you owe me nothing, having done vastly more than your share each time we have put in shore for the hunting.  But it will  not do, this plan of yours.  I will shamedly confess that the sound of that kingship in my Tin Islands sounds sweet to me.  But no, my lord, it will not do.  You are no mariner yet, and understand little of geography, but I must tell you that the part of Atlantis there"--he jerked his thumb towards the line of trees, and the mountains which lay beyond the fringe of surf--"is called the Dangerous Lands, and a man must needs be a salamander and be learned in magic (so I am told) before he can live there."  I laughed.  "We of the Priests' Clan have some education, Tob, though it may not be on the same lines as your own.  In fact, I may say I was taught in the colleges concerning the boundaries and the contents of our continent with a nicety that would surprise you.   And once ashore, my fate will still be under the control of the most High Gods."  He muttered something in his profane seaman's way about preferring to keep his own fate under control of his own most strong right arm, but saying that he would keep the matter in his thoughts, he excused himself hurriedly to go and see to somewhat concerning the working of the ship, and there left me.  But I think the sweets of kingly rule were a strong argument in favour of letting me have my way (which I should have had otherwise if it had not been given peacefully), and on the third day after our talk he put the ship inshore again for re-victualling.  We lurched into a river-mouth, half swamped over a roaring bar, and ran up against the bank and made fast there to trees, but booming ourselves a safe distance off with oars and poles, so that no beast could leap on board out of the thicket.  Fish-spearing and meat-hunting were set about with promptitude, and on the second day we were happy enough to slay a yearling river-horse, which gave provisions in all sufficiency.  A space was cleared on the bank, fires were lit, and the meat hung over the smoke in strips, and when as much was cured as the ship would carry, the shipmen made a final gorge on what remained, filled up a great stack of hollow reeds with drinking water, and were ready to continue the voyage.  With sturdy generosity did Tob again attempt to make me sail on with them as their future king, and as steadfastly did I make refusal; and at last stood alone on the bank amongst the gnawed bones of their feast, with my weapons to bear me company, and he, and his men, and the women stood in the little old ship, ready to drop down river with the current.  "At least," said Tob, "we'll carry your memory with us, and make it big in the Tin Islands for everlasting."  "Forget me," I said, "I am nothing.  I am merely an incident that has come in your way.  But if you want to carry some memory with you that shall endure, preserve the cult of the most High Gods as it was taught to you when you were children here in Atlantis.   And afterwards, when your colony grows in power, and has come to sufficient magnificence, you may send to the old country for a priest."  "We want no priest, except one we shall make ourselves, and that will be me.  And as for the old Gods--well, I have laid my ideas before the fellows here, and they agree to this: We are done with those old Gods for always.  They seem worn out, if one may judge from Their present lack of usefulness in Atlantis, and, anyway, there will be no room for Them on the Tin Islands.--Let go those warps there aft, and shove her head out.--We are under weigh now, my lord, and beyond recall, and so I am free to tell you what we have decided upon for our religious exercises.  We shall set up the memory of a living Hero on earth, and worship that.  And when in years to come the picture of his face grows dim, we shall doubtless make an image of him, as accurate as our art permits, and build him a temple for shelter, and bring there our offerings and prayers.  And as I say, my lord, I shall be priest, and when I am dead, the sons of my body shall be priests after me, and the eldest a king also."  "Let me plead with you," I said.  "This must not be."  The ship was drifting rapidly away with the current, and they were hoisting sail.  Tob had to shout to make himself heard.  "Aye, but it shall be.  For I, too, am a strong man after my kind, and I have ordered it so.  And if you want the name of our Hero that some day shall be God, you wear it on yourself.  Deucalion shall be God for our children."  "This is blasphemy," I cried.  "Have a care, fool, or this impiety will sink you."  "We will risk it," he bawled back, "and consider the odds against us are small.  Regard!  Here is thy last horn of wine in the ship, and my woman has treasured it against this moment.  Regard, all men, together with Those above and Those below!  I pour this wine as a libation to Deucalion, great lord that is to-day, Hero that shall be to-morrow, God that will be in time to come!"  And then all those on the ship joined in the acclaim till they were beyond the reach of my voice, and were battling their way out to sea through the roaring breakers of the bar.  Solitary I stood at the brink of the forest, looking after them and musing sadly.  Tob, despite his lowly station, was a man I cared for more than many.  Like all seamen, I knew that he paid his devotions to one of the obscurer Gods, but till then I had supposed him devout in his worship.  His new avowal came to me as a desolating shock.  If a man like Tob could forsake all the older Gods to set up on high some poor mortal who had momentarily caught his fancy, what could be expected from the mere thoughtless mob, when swayed by such a brilliant tongue as Phorenice's?  It seemed I was to begin my exile with a new dreariness added to all the other adverse prospects of Atlantis.  But then behind me I heard the rustle of some great beast that had scented me, and was coming to attack through the thicket, and so I had other matters to think upon.  I had to let Tob and his ship go out over the rim of the horizon unwatched.    15.  ZAEMON'S SUMMONS   Since the days when man was first created upon the earth by Gods who looked down and did their work from another place, there have always been areas of the land ill-adapted for his maintenance, but none more so than that part of Atlantis which lies over against the savage continents of Europe and Africa.  The common people avoid it, because of a superstition which says that the spirits of the evil dead stalk about there in broad daylight, and slay all those that the more open dangers of the place might otherwise spare.  And so it has happened often that the criminals who might have fled there from justice, have returned of their own free will, and voluntarily given themselves up to the tormentors, rather than face its fabulous terrors.  To the educated, many of these legends are known to be mythical; but withal there are enough disquietudes remaining to make life very arduous and stocked with peril.  Everywhere the mountains keep their contents on the boil; earth tremors are every day's experience; gushes of unseen evil vapours steal upon one with such cunningness and speed, that it is often hard to flee in time before one is choked and killed; poisons well up into the rivers, yet leave their colour unchanged; great cracks split across the ground reaching down to the fires beneath, and the waters gush into these, and are shot forth again with devastating explosion; and always may be expected great outpourings of boiling mud or molten rock.  Yet with all this, there are great sombre forests in these lands, with trees whose age is unimaginable, and fires amongst the herbage are rare.  All beneath the trees is water, and the air is full of warm steam and wetness.  For a man to live in that constant hot damp is very mortifying to the strength.  But strength is wanted, and cunning also beyond the ordinary, for these dangerous lands are the abode of the lizards, which of all beasts grow to the most enormous size and are the most fearsome to deal with.  There are countless families and species of these lizards, and with some of them a man can contend with prospect of success.  But there are others whose hugeness no human force can battle against.  One I saw, as it came up out of a lake after gaining its day's food, that made the wet land shake and pulse as it trod.  It could have taken Phorenice's mammoth into its belly,* and even a mammoth in full charge could not have harmed it.  Great horny plates covered its head and body, and on the ridge of its back and tail and limbs were spines that tore great slivers from the black trees as it passed amongst them.   * TRANSLATOR'S NOTE: Professor Reeder of the Wyoming State University has recently unearthed the skeleton of a Brontosaurus, 130 ft. in length, which would have weighed 50 tons when alive.  It was 35 ft. in height at the hips, and 25 ft. at the shoulder, and 40 people could be seated with comfort within its ribs.  Its thigh bone was 8 ft. long.  The fossils of a whole series of these colossal lizards have been found.   Now and again these monsters would get caught in some vast fissuring of the ground, but not often.  Their speed of foot was great, and their sagacity keen.  They seemed to know when the worst boilings of the mountains might be expected, and then they found safety in the deeper lakes, or buried themselves in wallows of the mud.  Moreover, they were more kindly constituted than man to withstand one great danger of these regions, in that the heat of the water did them no harm.  Indeed, they will lie peacefully in pools where sudden steam-bursts are making the water leap into boiling fountains, and I have seen one run quickly across a flow of molten rock which threatened to cut it off, and not be so much as singed in the transit.  In the midst of such neighbours, then, was my new life thrown, and existence became perilous and hard to me from the outset.  I came near to knowing what Fear was, and indeed only a fervent trust in the most High Gods, and a firm belief that my life was always under Their fostering care, prevented me from gaining that horrid knowledge.  For long enough, till I learned somewhat of the ways of this steaming, sweltering land, I was in as miserable a case as even Phorenice could have wished to see me.  My clothes rotted from my back with the constant wetness, till I went as naked as a savage from Europe; my limbs were racked with agues, and I could find no herbs to make drugs for their relief; for days together I could find no better food than tree-grubs and leaves; and often when I did kill beasts, knowing little of their qualities, I ate those that gave me pain and sickness.  But as man is born to make himself adaptable to his surroundings, so as the months dragged on did I learn the limitation of this new life of mine, and gather some knowledge of its resources.  As example: I found a great black tree, with a hollow core, and a hole into its middle near the roots.  Here I harboured, till one night some monstrous lizard, whose sheer weight made the tree rock like a sapling, endeavoured to suck me forth as a bird picks a worm from a hollow log.  I escaped by the will of the Gods--I could as much have done harm to a mountain as injure that horny tongue with my weapons--but I gave myself warning that this chance must not happen again.  So I cut myself a ladder of footholes on the inside of the trunk till I had reached a point ten man-heights from the ground, and there cut other notches, and with tree branches made a floor on which I might rest.  Later, for luxury, I carved me arrow-slit windows in the walls of my chamber, and even carried up sand for a hearth, so that I might cook my victual up there instead of lighting a fire in all the dangers of the open below.  By degrees, too, I began to find how the large-scaled fish of the rivers and the lesser turtles might be more readily captured, and so my ribs threatened less to start through their proper covering of skin as the days went on.  But the lack of salads and gruels I could never overcome.  All the green meat was tainted so powerfully with the taste of tars that never could I force my palate to accept it.  And of course, too, there remained the peril of the greater lizards and the other dangers native to the place.  But as the months began to mount into years, and the brute part of my nature became more satisfied, there came other longings which it was less easy to provide for.  From the ivory of a river horse's tooth I had endeavoured to carve me a representative of Nais as last I had seen her.  But, though my fingers might be loving, and my will good, my art was of the dullest, and the result--though I tried time and time again--was always clumsy and pitiful.  Still, in my eyes it carried some suggestion of the original--a curve here, an outline there, and it made my old love glow anew within me as I sat and ate it with my eyes.  Yet it did little to satisfy my longings for the woman I had lost; rather it whetted my cravings to be with her again, or at least to have some knowledge of her fate.  Other men of the Priests' Clan have come out and made an abode in these Dangerous Lands, and by mortifying the flesh, have gained an intimacy with the Higher Mysteries which has carried them far past what mere human learning and repetition could teach.  Indeed, here and there one, who from some cause and another has returned to the abodes of men, has carried with him a knowledge that has brought him the reputation amongst the vulgar for the workings of magic and miracles, which--since all arts must be allowed which aid so holy a cause--have added very materially to the ardour with which these common people pursue the cult of the Gods.  But for myself I could not free my mind to the necessary clearness for following these abstruse studies.  During that voyage home from Yucatan I had communed with them with growing insight; but now my mind was not my own.  Nais had a lien upon it, and refused to be ousted; and, in truth, her sweet trespass was my chief solace.  But at last my longing could no further be denied.  Through one of the arrow-slit windows of my tree-house I could see far away a great mountain top whitened with perpetual snow, which our Lord the Sun dyed with blood every night of His setting.  Night after night I used to watch that ruddy light with wide straining eyes.  Night after night I used to remember that in days agone when I was entering upon the priesthood, it had been my duty to adore our great Lord as He rose for His day behind the snows of that very mountain.  And always the thought followed on these musings, that from that distant crest I could see across the continent to the Sacred Mount, which had the city below it where I had buried my love alive.  So at last I gave way and set out, and a perilous journey I made of it.  In the heavy mists, which hung always on the lower ground, my way lay blind before me, and I was constantly losing it.  Indeed, to say that I traversed three times the direct distance is setting a low estimate.  Throughout all those swamps the great lizards hunted, and as the country was new to me I did not know places of harbour, and a hundred times was within an ace of being spied and devoured at a mouthful.  But the High Gods still desired me for Their own purposes, and blinded the great beasts' eyes when I slunk to cover as they passed.  Twice rivers of scalding water roared boiling across my path, and I had to delay till I could collect enough black timber from the forests to build rafts that would give me dry ferriage.  It will be seen then that my journey was in a way infinitely tedious, but to me, after all those years of waiting, the time passed on winged feet.  I had been separated from my love till I could bear the strain no longer; let me but see from a distance the place where she lay, and feast my eyes upon it for a while, and then I could go back to my abode in the tree and there remain patiently awaiting the will of the Gods.  The air grew more chilly as I began to come out above the region of trees, on to that higher ground which glares down on the rest of the world, and I made buskins and a coat of woven grasses to protect my body from the cold, which began to blow upon me keenly.  And later on, where the snow lay eternally, and was blown into gullies, and frozen into solid banks and bergs of ice, I had hard work to make any progress amongst its perilous mazes, and was moreover so numbed by the chill, that my natural strength was vastly weakened.  Overhead, too, following me up with forbidding swoops, and occasionally coming so close that I had to threaten it with my weapons, was one of those huge man-eating birds which live by pulling down and carrying off any creature that their instincts tell them is weakly, and likely soon to die.  But the lure ahead of me was strong enough to make these difficulties seem small, and though the air of the mountain agreed with me ill, causing sickness and panting, I pressed on with what speed I could muster towards the elusive summit.  Time after time I thought the next spurt would surely bring me out to the view for which my soul yearned, but always there seemed another bank of snow and ice yet to be climbed.  But at last I reached the crest, and gave thanks to the most High Gods for Their protection and favour.  Far, far away I could see the Sacred Mountain with its ring of fires burning pale under the day, and although the splendid city which nestled at its foot could not be seen from where I stood, I knew its position and I knew its plan, and my soul went out to that throne of granite in the square before the royal pyramid, where once, years before, I had buried my love.  Had Phorenice left the tomb unviolated?  I stood there leaning on my spear, filling my eye with the prospect, warming even to the smoke of mountains that I recognised as old acquaintances.  Gods! how my love burned within me for this woman.  My whole being seemed gone out to meet her, and to leave room for nothing beside.  For long enough a voice seemed dimly to be calling me, but I gave it no regard.  I had come out to that hoary mountain top for communion with Nais alone, and I wanted none others to interrupt.  But at length the voice calling my name grew too loud to be neglected, and I pulled myself out of my sweet musing with a start to think that here, for the first time since parting with Tob and his company, I should see another human fellow-being.  I gripped my weapon and asked who called.  The reply came clearly from up the slopes of mountain, and I saw a man coming towards me over the snows.  He was old and feeble.  His body was bent, and his hair and beard were white as the ground on which he trod, and presently I recognised him as Zaemon.  He was coming towards me with incredible speed for a man of his years and feebleness, but he carried in his hand the glowing Symbol of our Lord the Sun, and holy strength from this would add largely to his powers.  He came close to me and made the sign of the Seven, which I returned to him, with its completion, with due form and ceremony.  And then he saluted me in the manner prescribed as messenger appointed by the High Council of the Priests seated before the Ark of the Mysteries, and I made humble obeisance before him.  "In all things I will obey the orders that you put before me," I said.  "Such is your duty, my brother.  The command is, that you return immediately to the Sacred Mountain, so that if human means may still prevail, you, as the most skilful general Atlantis owns within her borders, may still save the country from final wreck and punishment.  The woman Phorenice persists in her infamies.  The poor land groans under her heel.  And now she has laid siege to our Sacred Mountain itself, and swears that not one soul shall be left alive in all Atlantis who does not bend humbly to her will."  "It is a command and I obey it.  But let me ask of another matter that is intimate to both of us.  What of Nais?"  "Nais rests where you left her, untouched.  Phorenice knows by her arts--she has stolen nearly all the ancient knowledge now--that still you live, and she keeps Nais unharmed beneath the granite throne in the hopes that some time she may use her as a weapon against you.  Little she knows the sternness of our Priests' creed, my brother.  Why, even I, that am the girl's father, would sacrifice her blithely, if her death or ruin might do a tittle of good to Atlantis."  "You go beyond me with your devotion."  The old man leaned forward at me, with glowering brow.  "What!"  "Or my old blind adherence to the ancient dogma has been sapped and weakened by events.  You must buy my full obedience, Zaemon, if you want it.  Promise me Nais--and your arts I know can snatch her--and I will be true servant to the High Council of the Priest, and will die in the last ditch if need be for the carrying out of order.  But let me see Nais given over to the fury of that wanton woman, and I shall have no inwards left, except to take my vengeance, and to see Atlantis piled up in ruins as her funeral- stone."  Zaemon looked at me bitterly.  "And you are the man the High Council thought to trust as they would trust one of themselves?  Truly we are in an age of weak men and faithless now.  But, my lord--nay, I must call you brother still: we cannot be too nice in our choosing to-day--you are the best there is, and we must have you.  We little thought you would ask a price for your generalship, having once taken oath on the walls of the Ark of the Mysteries itself that always, come what might, you would be a servant of the High Council of the Clan without fee and without hope of advancement.  But this is the age of broken vows, and you are going no more than trim with the fashion.  Indeed, brother, perhaps I should thank you for being no more greedy in your demands."  "You may spare me your taunts.  You, by self-denial and profound search into the highest of the higher Mysteries, have made yourself something wiser than human; I have preserved my humanity, and with it its powers and frailties; and it seems that each of us has his proper uses, or you would not be come now here to me. Rather you would have done the generalling yourself."  "You make a warm defence, my brother.  But I have no leisure now to stand before you with argument.  Come to the Sacred Mountain, fight me this wanton, upstart Empress, and by my beard you shall have your Nais as you left her as a reward."  "It is a command of the High Council which shall be obeyed.  I will  come with my brother now, as soon as he is rested."  "Nay," said the old man, "I have no tiredness, and as for coming with me, there you will not be able.  But follow at what pace you may."  He turned and set off down the snowy slopes of the mountain and I followed; but gradually he distanced me; and so he kept on, with speed always increasing, till presently he passed out of my sight round the spur of an ice-cliff, and I found myself alone on the mountain side.  Yes, truly alone.  For his footmarks in the snow from being deep, grew shallower, and less noticeable, so that I had to stoop to see them.  And presently they vanished entirely, and the great mountain's flank lay before me trackless, and untrodden by the foot of man since time began.  I was not shaken by any great amazement.  Though it was beyond my poor art to compass this thing myself, having occupied my mind in exile more with memories of Nais than in study of those uppermost recesses of the Higher Mysteries in which Zaemon was so prodigiously wise, still I had some inkling of his powers.  Zaemon I knew would be back again in his dwelling on the Sacred Mountain, shaken and breathless, even before I had found an end to his tracks in the snow, and it behoved me to join him there in the quickest possible time.  I had his promise now for my reward, and I knew that he would carry it into effect.  Beforetime I had made an error.  I had valued Atlantis most, and Nais, my private love, as only second.  But now it was in my mind to be honest with others even as with myself.  Though all the world were hanging on my choice, I could but love my Nais most, and serve her first and foremost of all.    16.  SIEGE OF THE SACRED MOUNTAIN   Now, my passage across the great continent of Atlantis, if tedious and haunted by many dangers, need not be recounted in detail here.  Only one halt did I make of any duration, and that was unavoidable.  I had killed a stag one day, bringing it down after a long chase in an open savannah.  I scented the air carefully, to see if there was any other beast which could do me harm within reach, and thinking that the place was safe, set about cutting my meat, and making a sufficiency into a bundle for carriage.  But underfoot amongst the grasses there was a great legged worm, a monstrous green thing, very venomous in its bite; and presently as I moved I brushed it with my heel, and like the dart of light it swooped with its tiny head and struck me with its fangs in the lower thigh.  With my knife I cut through its neck and it fell to writhing and struggling and twining its hundred legs into all manner of contortions; and then, cleaning my blade in the ground, I stabbed with it deep all round the wound, so that the blood might flow freely and wash the venom from its lodgement.  And then with the blood trickling healthily down from my heel, I shouldered the meat and strode off, thankful for being so well quit of what might have made itself a very ugly adventure.  As I walked, however, my leg began to be filled with a tightness and throbbing which increased every hour, and presently it began to swell also, till the skin was stretched like drawn parchment.  I was taken, too, with a sickness, that racked me violently, and if one of the greater and more dangerous beasts had come upon me then, he would have eaten me without a fight.  With the fall of darkness I managed to haul myself up into a tree, and there abode in the crutch of a limb, in wakefulness and pain throughout the night.  With the dawn, when the night beasts had gone to their lairs, I clambered down again, and leaning heavily on my spear, limped onwards through the sombre forests along my way.  The moss which grows on the northern side of each tree was my guide, but gradually I began to note that I was seeing moss all round the trees, and, in fact, was growing light-headed with the pain and the swelling of the limb.  But still I pressed onwards with my journey, my last instinct being to obey the command of the High Council, and so procure the enlargement of Nais as had been promised.  My last memory was of being met by someone in the black forest who aided me, and there my waking senses took wings into forgetfulness.  But after an interval, wit returned, and I found myself on a bed of leaves in a cleft between two rocks, which was furnished with some poor skill, and fortified with stakes and buildings against the entrance of the larger marauding beasts.  My wound was dressed with a poultice of herbs, and at the other side of the cavern there squatted a woman, cooking a mess of wood-grubs and honey over a fire of sticks.  "How came I here?" I asked.  "I brought you," said she.  "And who are you?"  "A nymph, they call me, and I practise as such, collecting herbs and curing the diseases of those that come to me, telling fortunes, and making predictions.  In return I receive what each can afford, and if they do not pay according to their means, I clap on a curse to make them wither.  It's a lean enough living when wars and the pestilence have left so few poor folk to live in the land."  "Do you visit Atlantis?"  "Not I. Phorenice would have me boiled in brine, living, if she could lay easy hands on me.  Our dainty Empress tolerates no magic but her own.  They say she is for pulling down the Priests off their Mountain now."  "So you do get news of the city?"  "Assuredly.  It is my trade to get good news, or otherwise how could I tell fortunes to the vulgar?  You see, my lord, I detected your quality by your speech, and knowing you are not one of those that come to me for spells, and potions, I have no fear in speaking to you plainly."  "Tell me then: Phorenice still reigns?"  "Most vilely."  "As a maiden?"  "As the mother of twin sons.  Tatho's her husband now, and has been these three years."  "Tatho!  Who followed him as viceroy of Yucatan?"  "There is no Yucatan.  A vast nation of little hairy men, so the tale goes, coming from the West overran the country.  They had clubs of wood tipped with stone as their only arm, but numbers made their chief weapon.  They had no desire for plunder, or the taking of slaves, or the conquering of cities.  To eat the flesh of Atlanteans was their only lust, and they followed it prodigiously.  Their numbers were like the bees in a swarm.  "They came to each of the cities of Yucatan in turn, and though the colonists slew them in thousands, the weight of numbers always prevailed.  They ate clean each city they took, and left it to the beasts of the forest, and went on to the next.  And so in time they reached the coast towns, and Tatho and the few that survived took ship, and sailed home.  They even ate Tatho's wife for him.  They must be curious persevering things, these little hairy men.  The Gods send they do not get across the seas to Atlantis, or they would be worse plague to the poor country than Phorenice."  Now I had heard of these little hairy creatures before, and though indeed I had never seen them, I had gathered that they were a little less than human and a little more than bestial; a link so to speak between the two orders; and specially held in check by the Gods in certain forest solitudes.  Also I had learned that on occasion, when punishment was needful, they could be set loose as a devastating army upon men, devouring all before them.  But I said nothing of this to the nymph, she being but a vulgar woman, and indeed half silly, as is always the case with these self-styled sorceresses who gull the ignorant, common folk.  But within myself I was bitterly grieved at the fate of that fine colony of Yucatan, in which I had expended such an infinity of pains to do my share of the building.  But it did not suit my purpose to have my name and quality blazoned abroad till the time was full, and so I said nothing to the nymph about Yucatan, but let the talk continue upon other matters.  "What about Egypt?" I asked.  "In its accustomed darkness, so they say.  Who cares for Egypt these latter years?  Who cares for anyone or anything for that matter except for himself and his own proper estate?  Time was when the country folk and the hunters hereabouts brought me offerings to this cave for sheer piety's sake.  But now they never come near unless they see a way of getting good value in return for their gifts.  And, by result, instead of living fat and hearty, I make lean meals off honey and grubs.  It's a poor life, a nymph's, in these latter years I tell you, my lord.  It's the fashion for all classes to believe in no kind of mystery now."  "What manner of pestilence is this you spoke of?"  "I have not seen it.  Thank the Gods it has not come this way.  But they do say that it has grown from the folk Phorenice has slain, and whose bodies remain unburied.  She is always slaying, and so the bodies lie thicker than the birds and beasts can eat them.  For which of our sins, I wonder, did the Gods let Phorenice come to reign?  I wish that she and her twins were boiled alive in brine before they came between an honest nymph of the forest and her living.  "They say she has put an image of herself in all the temples of the city now, and has ordered prayers and sacrifices to be made night and morning.  She has decreed all other Gods inferior to  herself and forbidden their worship, and those of the people that are not sufficiently devout for her taste, have their hamstrings slit by their tormentors to aid them constantly into a devotional attitude.--Will you eat of my grubs and honey?  There is nothing else.  Your back was bloody with carrying meat when I met you, but you had lost your load.  You must either taste this mess of mine now, or go without."  I harboured with that nymph in cave six days, she using her drugs and charms to cure my leg the while, and when I was recovered, I hunted the plains and killed her a fat cloven-hoofed horse as payment, and then went along my ways.  The country from there onwards had at one time carried a sturdy population which held its own firmly, and, as its numbers grew, took in more ground, and built more homesteads farther afield.  The houses were perched in trees for the most part, as there they were out of reach of cave-bear and cave-tiger and the other more dangerous beasts.  But others, and these were the better ones, were built on the ground, of logs so ponderous and so firmly clamped and dovetailed that the beasts could not pull them down, and once inside a house of this fashion its owners were safe, and could progue at any attackers through the interstices between the logs, and often wound, sometimes make a kill.  But not one in ten of these outlying settlers remained.  The houses were silent when I reached them, the fire-hearth before the door weed-grown, and the patch of vegetables taken back by the greedy fingers of the forest into mere scrub and jungle.  And farther on, when villages began to appear, strongly-walled as the custom is, to ward off the attacks of beasts, the logs which aforetime had barred the gateway lay strewn in a sprouting undergrowth, and naught but the kitchen middens remained to prove that once they had sheltered human tenants.  Phorenice's influence seemed to have spread as though it were some horrid blight over the whole face of what was once a smiling and an easy-living land.  So far I had met with little enough interference from any men I had come across.  Many had fled with their women into the depths of the forest at the bare sight of me; some stood their ground with a threatening face, but made no offer to attack, seeing that I did not offer them insult first; and a few, a very few, offered me shelter and provision.  But as I neared the city, and began to come upon muddy beaten paths, I passed through governments that were more thickly populated, and here appeared strong chance of delay.  The watcher in the tower which is set above each village would spy me and cry: "Here is a masterless man," and then the people that were within would rush out with intent to spoil me of my weapons, and afterwards to appoint me as a labourer.  I had no desire to slay these wretched folk, being filled with pity at the state to which they had fallen; and often words served me to make them stand aside from the path, and stare wonderingly at my fierceness, and let me go my ways.  And when at other times words had no avail, I strove to strike as lightly as could be, my object being to get forward with my journey and leave no unnecessary dead behind me.  Indeed, having found the modern way of these villages, it grew to be my custom to turn off into the forest, and make a circuit whenever I came within smell of their garbage.  Similarly, too, when I got farther on, and came amongst greater towns also, I kept beyond challenge of their walls, having no mind to risk delay from the whim of any new law which might chance to be set up by their governors.  My progress might be slinking, but my pride did not upbraid me very loudly; indeed, the fever of haste burned within me so hot and I had little enough carrying space for other emotions.  But at last I found myself within a half-day's journey the city of Atlantis itself, with the Sacred Mountain and its ring of fires looming high beside it, and the call for caution became trebly accentuated.  Everywhere evidences showed that the country had been drained of its fighting men.  Everywhere women prayed that the battles might end with the rout of the Priests or the killing of Phorenice, so that the wretched land might have peace and time to lick its wounds.  An army was investing the sacred Mountain, and its one approach was most narrowly guarded.  Even after having journeyed so far, it seemed as if I should have to sit hopelessly down without being able to carry out the orders which had been laid upon me by the High Council, and earn the reward which had been promised.  Force would be useless here.  I should have one good fight--a gorgeous fight--one man against an army, and my usefulness would be ended. . . .  No; this was the occasion for guile, and I found covert in the outskirts of a wood, and lay there cudgelling my brain for a plan.  Across the plain before me lay the grim great walls of the city, with the heads of its temples, and its palaces, and its pyramids showing beyond.  The step-sides of the royal pyramid held my eye.  Phorenice had expended some of her new-found store of gold in overlaying their former whiteness with sheets of shining yellow metal.  But it was not that change that moved me. I was remembering that, in the square before the pyramid, there stood a throne of granite carved with the snake and the outstretched hand, and in the hollow beneath the throne was Nais, my love, asleep these eight years now because of the drug that had been given to her, but alive still, and waiting for me, if only I on my part could make a way to the place where Zaemon defied the Empress, and announce my coming.  In that covert of the woods I lay a day and a night raging with myself for not discovering some plan to get within the defences of the Sacred Mountain, but in the morning which followed, there came a man towards me running.  "You need not threaten me with your weapons," he cried.  "I mean no harm.  It seems that you are Deucalion; though I should not have known you myself in those rags and skins, and behind that tangle of hair and beard.  You will give me your good word I know.  Believe me, I have not loitered unduly."  He was a lower priest whom I knew, and held in little esteem; his name was Ro, a greedy fellow and not overworthy of trust.  "From whom do you come?" I asked.  "Zaemon laid a command on me.  He came to my house, though how he got there I cannot tell, seeing that Phorenice's army blocks all possible passage to and from the Mountain.  I told him I wished to be mixed with none of his schemings.  I am a peaceful man, Deucalion, and have taken a wife who requires nourishment.  I still serve in the same temple, though we have swept out the old Gods by order of the Empress, and put her image in their place.  The people are tidily pious nowadays, those that are left of them, and the living is consequently easy.  Yes, I tell you there are far more offerings now than there were in the old days.  And so I had no wish to be mixed with matters which might well make me be deprived of a snug post, and my head to boot."  "I can believe it all of you, Ro."  "But there was no denying Zaemon.  He burst into one of his black furies, and while he spoke at me, I tell you I felt as good as dead.  You know his powers?"  "I have seen some of them."  "Well, the Gods alone know which are the true Gods, and which are the others.  I serve the one that gives me employment.  But those that Zaemon serves give him power, and that's beyond denying.  You see that right hand of mine?  It is dead and paralysed from the wrist, and that is a gift of Zaemon.  He bestowed it, he said, to make me collect my attention.  Then he said more hard things concerning what he was pleased to term my apostasy, not letting me put up a word in my own defence of how the change was forced upon me. And finally, said he, I might either do his bidding on a certain matter to the letter, or take that punishment which my falling away from the old Gods had earned.  'I shall not kill you,' said he, 'but I will cover all your limbs with a paralysis, such as you have tasted already, and when at length death reaches you in some gutter, you will welcome it.'"  "If Zaemon said those words, he meant them.  So you accepted the alternative?"  "Had I, with a wife depending on me, any other choice?  I asked his pleasure.  It was to find you when you came in here from some distant part of the land, and deliver to you his message.  "'Then tell me where is the meeting place,' said I, 'and when.'  "'There is none appointed, nor is the day fixed,' said he.  'You must watch and search always for him.  But when he comes, you will be guided to his place.'  Well, Deucalion, I think I was guided, but how, I do not know.  But now I have found you, and if there's such a thing as gratitude, I ask you to put in your word with Zaemon that this deadness be taken away from my hand.  It's an awful thing for a man to be forced to go through life like this, for no real fault of his own.  And Zaemon could cure it from where he sat, if he was so minded."  "You seem still to have a very full faith in some of the old Gods' priests," I said.  "But so far, I do not see that your errand is done.  I have had no message yet."  "Why, the message is so simple that I do not see why he could not have got some one else to carry it.  You are to make a great blaze.  You may fire the grasses of the plain in front of this wood if you choose.  And on the night which follows, you are to go round to that flank of the Sacred Mountain away from the city where the rocks run down sheer, and there they will lower a rope and haul you up to their hands above."  "It seems easy, and I thank you for your pains.  I will ask Zaemon that your hand may be restored to you."  "You shall have my prayers if it is.  And look, Deucalion, it is a small matter, and it would be less likely to slip your memory if you saw to it at once on your landing.  Later, you may be disturbed.  Phorenice is bound to pull you down off your perch up there now she has made her mind to it.  She never fails, once she has set her hand to a thing.  Indeed, if she was no Goddess at birth, she is making herself into one very rapidly.  She has got all the ancient learning of our Priests, and more besides.  She has discovered the Secret of Life these recent months--"  "She has found that?" I cried, fairly startled.  "How?  Tell me how?  Only the Three know that.  It is beyond our knowledge even who are members of the Seven."  "I know nothing of her means.  But she has the secret, and now she is as good an immortal (so she says) as any of them.  Well, Deucalion, it is dangerous for me to be missing from my temple overlong, so I will go.  You will carry that matter we spoke of in your mind?  It means much to me."--His eye wandered over my ragged person--"And if you think my service is of value to you--"  "You see me poor, my man, and practically destitute."  "Some small coin," he murmured, "or even a link of bronze?  I am at great expense just now buying nourishment for my wife.  Well, if you have nothing, you cannot give.  So I'll just bid you farewell."  He took himself off then, and I was not sorry.  I had never liked Ro.  But I wasted no more precious time then.  The grass blazed up for a signal almost before his timorous heels were clear of it, and that night when the darkness gave me cover, I took the risk of what beasts might be prowling, and went to the place appointed.  There was no rope dangling, but presently one came down the smooth cliff face like some slender snake.  I made a loop, slipped it over a leg, and pulled hard as a signal.  Those above began to haul, and so I went back to the Sacred Mountain after an absence of so many toilsome and warring years.  There were none to disturb the ascent.  Phorenice's troops had no thought to guard that gaunt, bare, seamless precipice.  The men who hauled me up were old, and panted heavily with their task, and, until I knew the reason, I wondered why a knot of younger priests had not been appointed for the duty.  But I put no question.  With us of the Priests' Clan on the Sacred Mountain, it is always taken as granted that when an order is given, it is given for the best.  Besides, these priests did not offer themselves to question.  They took me off at once to Zaemon, and that is what I could have wished.  The old man greeted me with the royal sign.  "All hail to Deucalion," he cried, "King of Atlantis, duly called thereto by the High Council of the priests."  "Is Phorenice dead?" I asked.  "It remains for you to slay her, and take your kingdom, if, indeed, when all is done, there remains a man or a rood of land to govern.  The sentence has gone out that she is to die, and it shall be carried into effect, even though we have to set loose the most dreadful powers that are stored in the Ark of the Mysteries, and wreck this continent in our effort.  We have borne with her infamies all these years by command sent down by the most High Gods; but now she has gone beyond endurance, and They it is who have given the word for her cutting off."  "You are one of the highest Three; I am only one of the Seven; you best know the cost."  "There can be no counting the cost now, my brother, and my king.  It is an order."  "It is an order," I repeated formally, "so I obey."  "If it were not impious to do so, it would be easy to justify this decision of the Gods.  The woman has usurped the throne; yet she was forgiven and bidden rule on wisely.  She has tampered with our holy religion; yet she was forgiven.  She has killed the peoples of Atlantis in greedy useless wars, and destroyed the country's trade; yet she was forgiven.  She has desecrated the old temples, and latterly has set up in them images of herself to be worshipped as a deity; yet she was forgiven.  But at last her evil cleverness has discovered to her the tremendous Secret of Life and Death, and there she overstepped the boundary of the High Gods' forbearance.  "I myself went to carry a final warning, and once more faced her in the great banqueting-hall.  Solemnly I recited to her the edict, and she chose to take it as a challenge.  She would live on eternally herself and she would share her knowledge with those that pleased her.  Tatho that was her husband should also be immortal.  Indeed, if she thought fit, she would cry the secret aloud so that even the common people might know it, and death from mere age would become a legend.  "She cared no wit how she might upset the laws of Nature.  She was Phorenice, and was the highest law of all.  And finally she defied me there in that banqueting-hall and defied also the High Gods that stood behind my mouth.  'My magic is as strong as yours, you pompous fool,' she cried, 'and presently you shall see the two stand side by side upon their trial.'  "She began to collect an army from that moment, and we on our part made our preparations.  It was discovered by our arts that you still lived, and King of Atlantis you were made by solemn election.  How you were summoned, you know as nearly as it is lawful that one of your degree should know; how you came, you understand best yourself; but here you are, my brother, and being King now, you must order all things as you see best for the preservation of your high estate, and we others live only to give you obedience."  "Then being King, I can speak without seeming to make use of a threat.  I must have my Queen first, or I am not strong enough to give my whole mind to this ruling."  "She shall be brought here."  "So!  Then I will be a General now, and see to the defences of this place, and view the men who are here to stand behind them."  I went out of the dwelling then, Zaemon giving place and following me.  It was night still but there is no darkness on the upper part of the Sacred Mountain.  A ring of fires, fed eternally from the earth-breath which wells up from below, burns round one- half of the crest, lighting it always as bright as day, and in fact forming no small part of its fortification.  Indeed, it is said that, in the early dawn of history, men first came to the Mountain as a stronghold because of the natural defence which the fires offered.  There is no bridging these flames or smothering them.  On either side of their line for a hundred paces the ground glows with heat, and a man would be turned to ash who tried to cross it.  Round full one-half the mountain slopes the fires make a rampart unbreakable, and on the other side the rock runs in one sheer precipice from the crest to the plain which spreads beyond its foot.  But it is on this farther side that there is the only entrance way which gives passage to the crest of the Sacred Mountain from below.  Running diagonally up the steep face of the cliff is a gigantic fissure, which succeeding ages (as man has grown more luxurious) have made more easy to climb.  Looking at the additions, in the ancient days, I can well imagine that none but the most daring could have made the ascent.  But one generation has thrown a bridge over a bad gap here, and another has cut into the living stone and widened a ledge there, till in these latter years there is a path with cut steps and carved balustrade such as the feeblest or most giddy might traverse with little effort or exertion.  But always when these improvers made smooth the obstacles, they were careful to weaken in no possible way the natural defences but rather to add to them.  Eight gates of stone there were cutting the pathway, each commanding a straight, steep piece of the ascent, and overhanging each gate was a gallery secure from arrow-shot, yet so contrived that great stones could be hurled through holes in the floor of it, in such a manner that they must irretrievably smash to a pulp any men advancing against it from below.  And in caves dug out from the rock on either hand was a great hoard of these stones, so that no enemy through sheer expenditure of troops could hope to storm a gate by exhausting its ammunition.  But though there were eight of these granite gates in the series, we had the whole number to depend on no longer.  The lowest gate was held by a garrison of Phorenice's troops, who had built a wall above them to protect their occupation.  The gate had been gained by no brilliant feat of arms--it had been won by threats, bribery, and promises; or, in other words, it had been given up by the blackest treachery.  And here lay the keynote of the weakness in our defence.  The most perfect ramparts that brain can invent are useless without men to line them, and it was men we lacked.  Of students entering into the colleges of the Sacred Mountain, there had been none now for many a year.  The younger generation thought little of the older Gods.  Of the men that had grown up amongst the sacred groves, and filled offices there, many had become lukewarm in their faith and remained on only through habit, and because an easy living stayed near them there; and these, when the siege began, quickly made their way over to the other side.  Phorenice was no fool to fight against unnecessary strength.  Her heralds made proclamation that peace and a good subsistence would be given to those who chose to come out to her willingly; and as an alternative she would kill by torture and mutilation those she caught in the place when she took it by storm, as she most assuredly would do before she had finished with it. And so great was the prestige of her name, that quite one-half of these that remained on the mountain took themselves away from the defence.  There was no attempt to hold back these sorry priests, nor was there any punishing them as they went.  Zaemon, indeed, was minded (so he told me with grim meaning himself) to give them some memento of their apostasy to carry away which would not wear out, but the others of the High Council made him stay his vengeful hand.  And so when I came to the place the garrison numbered no more than eighty, counting even feeble old dotards who could barely walk; and of men not past their prime I could barely command a score.  Still, seeing the narrowness of the passages which led to each of the gates, up which in no place could more than two men advance together, we were by no means in desperate straits for the defence as yet; and if my new-given kingdom was so far small, consisting as it did in effect of the Sacred Mountain and no other part of Atlantis, at any rate there seemed little danger of its being further contracted.  Another of the wise precautions of the men of old stood us in good stead then.  In the ancient times, when grain first was grown as food, it came to be looked upon as the acme of wealth.  Tribute was always paid from the people to their Priests, and presently, so the old histories say, it was appointed that this should take the form of grain, as this was a medium both dignified and fitting.  And those of the people who had it not, were forced to barter their other produce for grain before they could pay this tribute.  On the Sacred Mountain itself vast storehouses were dug in the rock, and here the grain was teemed in great yellow heaps, and each generation of those that were set over it, took a pride in adding to the accumulation.  In more modern days it had been a custom amongst the younger and more forward of the Priests to scoff at this ancient provision, and to hold that a treasure of gold, or weapons, or jewels would have more value and no less of dignity; and more than once it has been a close thing lest these innovators should not be out-voted.  But as it was, the old constitution had happily been preserved, and now in these years of trial the Clan reaped the benefit.  And so with these granaries, and a series of great tanks and cisterns which held the rainfall, there was no chance of Phorenice reducing our stronghold by mere close investment, even though she sat down stubbornly before it for a score of years.  But it was the paucity of men for the defence which oppressed me most.  As I took my way about the head of the Mountain, inspecting all points, the emptiness of the place smote me like a succession of blows.  The groves, once so trim, were now shaggy and unpruned.  Wind had whirled the leaves in upon the temple floors, and they lay there unswept.  The college of youths held no more now than a musty smell to bear witness that men had once been grown there.  The homely palaces of the higher Priests, at one time so ardently sought after, lay many of them empty, because not even one candidate came forward now to canvass for election.  Evil thoughts surged up within me as I saw these things, that were direct promptings from the nether Gods.  "There must be something wanting," these tempters whispered, "in a religion from which so many of its Priests fled at the first pinch of persecution."  I did what I could to thrust these waverings resolutely behind me; but they refused to be altogether ousted from my brain; and so I made a compromise with myself: First, I would with the help that might be given me, destroy this wanton Phorenice, and regain the kingdom which had been given me to my own proper rule; and afterwards I would call a council of the Seven and council of the Three, and consider without prejudice if there was any matter in which our ancient ritual could be amended to suit the more modern requirements.  But this should not be done till Phorenice was dead and I was firmly planted in her room.  I would not be a party, even to myself, to any plan which smacked at all of surrender.  And there as I walked through the desolate groves and beside the cold altars, the High Gods were pleased to show their approval of my scheme, and to give me opportunity to bind myself to it with a solemn oath and vow.  At that moment from His distant resting-place in the East, our Lord the Sun leaped up to begin another day.  For long enough from where I stood below the crest of the Mountain, He Himself would be invisible.  But the great light of His glory spread far into the sky, and against it the Ark of the Mysteries loomed in black outline from the highest crag where it rested, lonely and terrible.  For anyone unauthorised to go nearer than a thousand paces to this storehouse of the Highest Mysteries meant instant death.  On that day when I was initiated as one of the Seven, I had been permitted to go near and once press my lips against its ample curves; and the rank of my degree gave me the privilege to repeat that salute again once on each day when a new year was born.  But what lay inside its great interior, and how it was entered, that was hidden from the Seven, even as it was from the other Priests and the common people in the city below.  Only those who had been raised to the sublime elevation of the Three had a knowledge of the dreadful powers which were stored within it.  I went down on my knees where I was, and Zaemon knelt beside me, and together we recited the prayers which had been said by the Priests from the beginning of time, giving thanks to our great Lord that He has come to brighten another day.  And then, with my eyes fixed on the black outline of the Ark of Mysteries I vowed that, come what might, I at least would be true servant of the High Gods to my life's end, and that my whole strength should be spent in restoring Their worship and glory.    17.  NAIS THE REGAINED   Now, from where we stood together just below the crest of the Sacred Mountain, we could see down into the city, which lay spread out below us like a map.  The harbour and the great estuary gleamed at its farther side; and the fringe of hills beyond smoked and fumed in their accustomed fashion; the great stone circle of our Lord the Sun stood up grim and bare in the middle of the city; and nearer in reared up the great mass of the royal pyramid, the gold on its sides catching new gold from the Sun.  There, too, in the square before the pyramid stood the throne of granite, dwarfed by the distance to the size of a mole's hill, in which these nine years my love had lain sleeping.  Old Zaemon followed my gaze.  "Ay," he said with a sigh, "I know where your chief interest is.  Deucalion when he landed here new from Yucatan was a strong man.  The King whom we have chosen--and who is the best we have to choose--has his weakness."  "It can be turned into additional strength.  Give me Nais here, living and warm to fight for, and I am a stronger man by far than the cold viceroy and soldier that you speak about."  "I have passed my word to that already, and you shall have her, but at the cost of damaging somewhat this new kingdom of yours.  Maybe too at the same time we may rid you of this Phorenice and her brood.  But I do not think it likely.  She is too wily, and once we begin our play, she is likely to guess whence it comes, and how it will end, and so will make an escape before harm can reach her.  The High Gods, who have sent all these trials for our refinement, have seen fit to give her some knowledge of how these earth tremors may be set a-moving."  "I have seen her juggle with them.  But may I hear your scheme?"  "It will be shown you in good time enough.  But for the present I would bid you sleep.  It will be your part to go into the city to-night, and take your woman (that is my daughter) when she is set free, and bring her here as best you can.  And for that you will need all a strong man's strength."--He stepped back, and looked me up and down.--"There are not many folk that would take you for the tidy clean-chinned Deucalion now, my brother.  Your appearance will be a fine armour for you down yonder in the city to-night when we wake it with our earth-shaking and terror.  As you stand now, you are hairy enough, and shaggy enough, and naked enough, and dirty enough for some wild savage new landed out of Europe.  Have a care that no fine citizen down yonder takes a fancy to your thews, and seizes upon you as his servant."  "I somewhat pity him in his household if he does."  Old Zaemon laughed.  "Why, come to think of it, so do I."  But quickly he got grave again.  Laughter and Zaemon were very rare playmates.  "Well, get you to bed, my King, and leave me to go into the Ark of Mysteries and prepare there with another of the Three the things that must be done.  It is no light business to handle the tremendous powers which we must put into movement this night.  And there is danger for us as there is for you.  So if by chance we do not meet again till we stand up yonder behind the stars, giving account to the Gods, fare you well, Deucalion."  I slept that day as a soldier sleeps, taking full rest out of the hours, and letting no harassing thought disturb me.  It is only the weak who permit their sleep to be broken on these occasions.  And when the dark was well set, I roused and fetched those who should attend to the rope.  Our Lady the Moon did not shine at that turn of the month: and the air was full of a great blackness.  So I was out of sight all the while they lowered me.  I reached the tumbled rocks that lay at the deep foot of the cliff, and then commenced to use a nice caution, because Phorenice's soldiers squatted uneasily round their camp-fires, as though they had forebodings of the coming evil.  I had no mind to further stir their wakefulness.  So I crept swiftly along in the darkest of the shadows, and at last came to the spot where that passage ends which before I had used to get beneath the walls of the city.  The lamp was in place, and I made my way along the windings swiftly.  The air, so it seemed to me, was even more noxious with vapours than it had been when I was down there before, and I judged that Zaemon had already begun to stir those internal activities which were shortly to convulse the city.  But again I had difficulty in finding an exit, and this, not because there were people moving about at the places where I had to come out, but because the set of the masonry was entirely changed.  In olden times the Priests' Clan oversaw all the architects' plans, and ruled out anything likely to clash with their secret passages and chambers.  But in this modern day the Priests were of small account, and had no say in this matter, and the architects often through sheer blundering sealed up and made useless many of these outlets and hiding-places.  As it was then, I had to get out of the network of tunnels and galleries where I could, and not where I would, and in the event found myself at the farther side of the city, almost up to where the outer wall joins down to the harbour.  I came out without being seen, careful even in this moment of extremity to preserve the ordinances, and closed all traces of exit behind me.  The earth seemed to spring beneath my feet like the deck of a ship in smooth water; and though there was no actual movement as yet to disturb the people, and indeed these slept on in their houses and shelters without alarm, I could feel myself that the solid deadness of the ground was gone, and that any moment it might break out into devastating waves of movement.  Gods!  Should I be too late to see the untombing of my love?  Would she be laid there bare to the public gaze when presently the people swarmed out into the open spaces through fear at what the great earth tremor might cause to fall?  I could see, in fancy, their rude, cruel hands thrust upon her as she lay there helpless, and my inwards dried up at the thought.  I ran madly down and down the narrow winding streets with the one thought of coming to the square which lay in front of the royal pyramid before these things came to pass.  With exquisite cruelty I had been forced with my own hands to place her alive in her burying-place beneath the granite throne, and if thews and speed could do it, I would not miss my reward of taking her forth again with the same strong hands.  Few disturbed that furious hurry.  At first here and there some wretch who harboured in the gutter cried: "A thief!  Throw a share or I pursue."  But if any of these followed, I do not know.  At any rate, my speed then must have out-distanced anyone.  Presently, too, as the swing of the earth underfoot became more keen, and the stonework of the buildings by the street side began to grate and groan and grit, and sent forth little showers of dust, people began to run with scared cries from out of their doors.  But none of these had a mind to stop the ragged, shaggy, savage man who ran so swiftly past, and flung the mud from his naked feet.  And so in time I came to the great square, and was there none too soon.  The place was filling with people who flocked away from the narrow streets, and it was full of darkness, and noise, and dust, and sickness.  Beneath us the ground rippled in undulations like a sea, which with terrifying slowness grew more and more intense.  Ever and again a house crashed down unseen in the gloom, and added to the tumult.  But the great pyramid had been planned by its old builders to stand rude shocks.  Its stones were dovetailed into one another with a marvellous cleverness, and were further clamped and joined by ponderous tongues of metal.  It was a boast that one-half the foundations could be dug from beneath it, and still the pyramid would stand four-square under heaven, more enduring than the hills.  Flickering torches showed that its great stone doors lay open, and ever and again I saw some frightened inmate scurry out and then be lost to sight in the gloom.  But with the royal pyramid and its ultimate fate I had little concern; I did not even care then whether Phorenice was trapped, or whether she came out sound and fit for further mischief.  I crouched by the granite throne which stood in the middle of that splendid square, and heard its stones grate together like the ends of a broken bone as it rocked to the earth-waves.  In that night of dust and darkness it was hard to see the outline of one's own hand, but I think that the Gods in some requital for the love which had ached so long within me, gave me special power of sight.  As I watched, I saw the great carved rock which formed the capstone of the throne move slightly and then move again, and then again; a tiny jerk for each earth-pulse, but still there was an appreciable shifting; and, moreover, the stone moved always to one side.  There was method in Zaemon's desperate work, and this in my blind panic of love and haste, I had overlooked.  So I went up the steps of the throne on the side from which the great capstone was moving, and clung there afire with expectation.  More and more violent did the earth-swing grow, though the graduations of its increase could not be perceived, and the din of falling houses and the shrieks and cries of hurt and frightened people went louder up into the night.  Thicker grew the dust that filled the air, till one coughed and strangled in the breathing, and more black did the night become as the dust rose and blotted the rare stars from sight.  I clung to an angle of the granite throne, crouching on the uppermost step but one below the capstone, and could scarcely keep my place against the violence of the earth tremors.  But still the huge capstone that was carved with the snake and the outstretched hand held my love fast locked in her living tomb, and I could have bit the cold granite at the impotence which barred me from her.  The people who kept thronging into the square were mad with terror, but their very numbers made my case more desperate every moment.  "Phorenice, Goddess, aid us now!" some cried, and when the prayer did not bring them instant relief, they fell to yammering out the old confessions of the faith which they had learned in childhood, turning in this hour of their dreadful need to those old Gods, which, through so many dishonourable years, they had spurned and deserted.  It was a curious criticism on the balance of their real religion, if one had cared to make it.  Louder grew the crash of falling masonry; and from the royal pyramid itself, though indeed I could not even see its outline through the darkness, there came sounds of grinding stones and cracking bars of metal which told that even its superb majestic strength had a breaking strain.  There came to my mind the threat that old Zaemon had thundered forth in that painted, perfumed  banqueting-hall: "You shall see," he had cried to the Empress, "this royal pyramid which you have polluted with your debaucheries torn tier from tier, and stone from stone, and scattered as feathers spread before a wind!"  Still heavier grew the surging of the earth, and the pavement of the great square gaped and upheaved, and the people who thronged it screamed still more shrilly as their feet were crushed by the grinding blocks.  And now too the great pyramid itself was commencing to split, and gape, and topple.  The roofs of its splendid chambers gave way, and the ponderous masonry above shuttered down and filled them.  In part, too, one could see the destruction now, and not guess at it merely from the fearful hearings of the darkness.  Thunders had begun to roar through the black night above, and add their bellowings to this devil's orchestration of uproar, and vivid lightning splashes lit the flying dust-clouds.  It was perhaps natural that she should be there, but it came as a shock when a flare of the lightning showed me Phorenice safe out in the square, and indeed standing not far from myself.  She had taken her place in the middle of a great flagstone, and stood there swaying her supple body to the shocks.  Her face was calm, and its loveliness was untouched by the years.  From time to time she brushed away the dust as it settled on the short red hair which curled about her neck.  There was no trace of fear written upon her face.  There was some weariness, some contempt, and I think a tinge of amusement.  Yes, it took more than the crumbling of her royal pyramid to impress Phorenice with the infinite powers of those she warred against.  Gods!  How the sight of her cool indifference maddened me then.  I had it in me to have strangled her with my hands if she had come within my reach.  But as it was, she stood in her place, swaying easily to the earth-waves as a sailor sways on a ship's deck, and beside her, crouched on the same great flagstone, and overcome with nausea was Ylga, who again was raised to be her fan-girl.  It came to my mind that Ylga was twin sister to Nais, and that I owed her for an ancient kindness, but I had leisure to do nothing for her then, and indeed it was little enough I could have done.  With each shock the great capstone of the throne to which I clung jarred farther and farther from its bed place, and my love was coming nearer to me.  It was she who claimed all my service then.  Once in their blind panic a knot of the people in the square thought that the granite stone was too solid to be overturned, and saw in it an oasis of safety.  They flocked towards it, many of them dragging themselves up the steep deep high steps on hands and knees because their feet had been injured by the billowing flagstones of the square.  But I was in no mood to have the place profaned by their silly tremblings and stares: I beat at them with my hands, tearing them away, and hurling them back down the steepness of the steps.  They asked me what was my title to the place above their own, and I answered them with blows and gnashing teeth.  I was careless as to what they thought me or who they thought me.  Only I wished them gone.  And so they went, wailing and crying that I was a devil of the night, for they had no spirit left to defend themselves.  Farther and farther the great stone that made the top of the throne slid out from its bed, but its slowness of movement maddened me.  A life's education left me in that moment, and I had no trace of stately patience left.  In my puny fury I thrust at the great block with my shoulder and head, and clawed at it with my hands till the muscles rose on me in great ropes and knots, and the High Gods must have laughed at my helplessness as They looked.  All was being ordered by the Three who were Their trusted servants, in Their good time.  The work of the Gods may be done slowly, but it is done exceeding sure.  But at last, when all the people of the city were numb with terror, and incapable of further emotion (save only for Phorenice who still had nerve enough to show no concern), what had been threatened came to pass.  The capstone of the throne slid out till it reached the balance, and the next shock threw it with a roar and a clatter to the ground.  And then a strange tremor seized me.  After all the scheming and effort, what I had so ardently prayed for had come about; but yet my inwards sank at the thought of mounting on the stone where I had mounted before, and taking my dear from the hollow where my hands had laid her.  I knew Phorenice's vengefulness, and had a high value for her cleverness.  Had she left Nais to lie in peace, or had she stolen her away to suffer indignities elsewhere?  Or had she ended her sleep with death, and (as a grisly jest) left the corpse for my finding?  I could not tell; I dared not guess.  Never during a whole hard- fighting life have my emotions been so wrenched as they were at that moment.  And, for excuse, it must be owned that love for Nais had sapped my hardihood over a matter in which she was so privately concerned.  It began to come to my mind, however, that the infernal uproar of the earth tremor was beginning to slacken somewhat, as though Zaemon knew he had done the work that he had promised, and was minded to give the wretched city a breathing space.  So I took my fortitude in hand, and clambered up on to the flat of the stone.  The lightning flashes had ceased and all was darkness again and stifling dust, but at any moment the sky might be lit once more, and if I were seen in that place, shaggy and changed though I might be, Phorenice, if she were standing near, would not be slow to guess my name and errand.  So changed was I for the moment, that I will finely confess that the idea of a fight was loathsome to me then.  I wanted to have my business done and get gone from the place.  With hands that shook, I fumbled over the face of the stone and found the clamps and bars of metal still in position where I had clenched them, and then reverently I let my fingers pass between these, and felt the curves of my love's body in its rest beneath.  An exultation began to whirl within me.  I did not know if she had been touched since I last left her; I did not know if the drug would have its due effect, and let her be awakened to warmth and sight again; but, dead or alive, I had her there, and she was mine, mine, mine, and I could have yelled aloud in my joy at her possession.  Still the earth shook beneath us, and masonry roared and crashed into ruin.  I had to cling to my place with one hand, whilst I unhasped the clamps of metal that made the top of her prison with the other.  But at last I swung the upper half of them clear, and those which pinned down her feet I let remain.  I stooped and drew her soft body up on to the flat of the stone beside me, and pressed my lips a hundred times to the face I could not see.  Some mad thought took me, I believe, that the mere fierceness and heat of my kisses would bring her back again to life and wakefulness.  Indeed I will own plainly, that I did but sorry credit to my training in calmness that night.  But she lay in my arms cold and nerveless as a corpse, and by degrees my sober wits returned to me.  This was no place for either of us.  Let the earth's tremors cease (as was plainly threatened), let daylight come, and let a few of these nerveless people round recover from their panic, and all the great cost that had been expended might be counted as waste.  We should be seen, and it would not be long before some one put a name to Nais; and then it would be an easy matter to guess at Deucalion under the beard and the shaggy hair and the browned nakedness of the savage who attended on her.  Tell of fright?  By the Gods!  I was scared as the veriest trembler who blundered amongst the dust-clouds that night when the thought came to me.  With all that ruin spread around, it would be hopeless to think that any of those secret galleries which tunnelled under the ground would be left unbroken, and so it was useless to try a passage under the walls by the old means.  But I had heard shouts from that frightened mob which came to me through the din and the darkness, that gave another idea for escape.  "The city is accursed," they had cried: "if we stay here it will fall on us.  Let us get outside the walls where there are no buildings to bury us."  If they went, I could not see.  But one gate lay nearest to the royal pyramid, and I judged that in their panic they would not go farther than was needful.  So I put the body of Nais over my shoulder (to leave my right arm free) and blundered off as best I could through the stifling darkness.  It was hard to find a direction; it was hard to walk in the inky darkness over ground that was tossed and tumbled like a frozen sea: and as the earth still quaked and heaved, it was hard also to keep a footing.  But if I did fall myself a score of times, my dear burden got no bruise, and presently I got to the skirts of the square, and found a street I knew.  The most venomous part of the shaking was done, and no more buildings fell, but enough lay sprawled over the roadway to make walking into a climb, and the sweat rolled from me as I laboured along my way.  There was no difficulty about passing the gate.  There was no gate.  There was no wall.  The Gods had driven their plough through it, and it lay flat, and proud Atlantis stood as defenceless as the open country.  Though I knew the cause of this ruin, though, in fact, I had myself in some measure incited it, I was almost sad at the ruthlessness with which it had been carried out.  The royal pyramid might go, houses and palaces might be levelled, and for these I cared little enough; but when I saw those stately ramparts also filched away, there the soldier in me woke, and I grieved at this humbling of the mighty city that once had been my only mistress.  But this was only a passing regret, a mere touch of the fighting-man's pride.  I had a different love now, that had wrapped herself round me far deeper and more tightly, and my duty was towards her first and foremost.  The night would soon be past, and then dangers would increase.  None had interfered with us so far, though many had jostled us as I clambered over the ruins; but this forbearance could not be reckoned upon for long.  The earth tremors had almost died away, and after the panic and the storm, then comes the time for the spoiling.  All men who were poor would try to seize what lay nearest to their hands, and those of higher station, and any soldiers who could be collected and still remained true to command, would ruthlessly stop and strip any man they saw making off with plunder.  I had no mind to clash with these guardians of law and property, and so I fled on swiftly through the night with my burden, using the unfrequented ways; and crying to the few folk who did meet me that the woman had the plague, and would they lend me the shelter of their house as ours had fallen.  And so in time we came to the place where the rope dangled from the precipice, and after Nais had been drawn up to the safety of the Sacred Mountain, I put my leg in the loop of the rope and followed her.  Now came what was the keenest anxiety of all.  We took the girl and laid her on a bed in one of the houses, and there in the lit room for the first time I saw her clearly.  Her beauty was drawn and pale.  Her eyes were closed, but so thin and transparent had grown the lids that one could almost see the brown of the pupil beneath them.  Her hair had grown to inordinate thickness and length, and lay as a cushion behind and beside her head.  There was no flicker of breath; there was none of that pulsing of the body which denotes life; but still she had not the appearance of ordinary death.  The Nais I had placed nine long years before to rest in the hollow of the stone, was a fine grown woman, full bosomed, and well boned.  The Nais that remained for me was half her weight.  The old Nais it would have puzzled me to carry for an hour: this was no burden to impede a grown man.  In other ways too she had altered.  The nails of her fingers had grown to such a great length that they were twisted in spirals, and the fingers themselves and her hands were so waxy and transparent that the bony core upon which they were built showed itself beneath the flesh in plain dull outline.  Her clay-cold lips were so white, that one sighed to remember the full beauty of their carmine.  Her shoulders and neck had lost their comely curves, and made bony hollows now in which the dust of entombment lodged black and thickly.  Reverently I set about preparing those things which if all went well should restore her.  I heated water and filled a bath, and tinctured it heavily with those essences of the life of beasts which the Priests extract and store against times of urgent need and sickness.  I laid her chin-deep in this bath, and sat beside it to watch, maintaining that bath at a constant blood heat.  An hour I watched; two hours I watched; three hours--and yet she showed no flicker of life.  The heat of her body given her by the bath, was the same as the heat of my own.  But in the feel of her skin when I stroked it with my hand, there was something lacking still.  Only when our Lord the Sun rose for His day did I break off my watching, whilst I said the necessary prayer which is prescribed, and quickly returned again to the gloom of the house.  I was torn with anxiety, and as the time went on and still no sign of life came back, the hope that had once been so high within me began to sicken and leave me downcast and despondent.  From without, came the din of fighting.  Already Phorenice had sent her troops to storm the passageway, and the Priests who defended it were shattering them with volleys of rocks.  But these sounds of war woke no pulse within me.  If Nais did not wake, then the world for me was ended, and I had no spirit left to care who remained uppermost.  The Gods in Their due time will doubtless smite me for this impiety.  But I make a confession of it here on these sheets, having no mind to conceal any portion of this history for the small reason that it does me a personal discredit.  But as the hours went on, and still no flicker of life came to lessen the dumb agony that racked me, I grew more venturesome, and added more essences to the bath, and drugs also such as experience had shown might wake the disused tissues into life.  I watched on with staring eyes, rubbing her wasted body now and again, and always keeping the heat of the bath at a constant.  From the first I had barred the door against all who would have come near to help me.  With my own hands I had laid my love to sleep, and I could not bear that others should rouse her, if indeed roused she should ever be.  But after those first offers, no others came, and the snarl and din of fighting told of what occupied them.  It is hard to take note of small changes which occur with infinite slowness when one is all the while on the tense watch, and high strung though my senses were, I think there must have been some indication of returning life shown before I was keen enough to notice it. For of a sudden, as I gazed, I saw a faint rippling on the surface of the water of the bath.  Gods!  Would it come back again to my love at last--this life, this wakefulness?  The ripple died out as it had come, and I stooped my head nearer to the bath to try if I could see some faint heaving of her bosom some small twitching of the limbs.  No, she lay there still without even a flutter of movement.  But as I watched, surely it seemed to my aching eyes that some tinge was beginning to warm that blank whiteness of skin?  How I filled myself with that sight.  The colour was returning to her again beyond a doubt.  Once more the dried blood was becoming fluid and beginning again to course in its old channels.  Her hair floated out in the liquid of the bath like some brown tangle of the ocean weed, and ever and again it twitched and eddied to some impulse which in itself was too small for the eye to see.  She had slept for nine long years, and I knew that the wakening could be none of the suddenest.  Indeed, it came by its own gradations and with infinite slowness, and I did not dare do more to hasten it.  Further drugs might very well stop eternally what those which had been used already had begun.  So I sat motionless where I was, and watched the colour come back, and the waxenness go, and even the fullness of her curves in some small measure return.  And when growing strength gave her power to endure them, and she was racked with those pains which are inevitable to being born back again in this fashion to life, I too felt the reflex of her agony, and writhed in loving sympathy.  Still further, too, was I wrung by a torment of doubt as to whether life or these rackings would in the end be conqueror.  After each paroxysm the colour ebbed back from her again, and for a while she would lie motionless.  But strength and power seemed gradually to grow, and at last these prevailed, and drove death and sleep beneath them.  Her eyelids struggled with their fastenings.  Her lips parted, and her bosom heaved.  With shivering gasps her breath began to pant between her reddening lips.  At first it rattled dryly in her throat, but soon it softened and became more regular.  And then with a last effort her eyes, her glorious loving eyes, slowly opened.  I leaned over and called her softly by name.  Her eyes met mine, and a glow arose from their depths that gave me the greatest joy I have met in all the world.  "Deucalion, my love," she whispered.  "Oh, my dear, so you have come for me.  How I have dreamed of you!  How I have been racked!  But it was worth it all for this."    18.  STORM OF THE SACRED MOUNTAIN   It was Nais herself who sent me to attend to my sterner duties.  The din of the attack came to us in the house where I was tending her, and she asked its meaning.  As pithily as might be, for she was in no condition for tedious listening, I gave her the history of her nine years' sleep.  The colour flushed more to her face.  "My lord is the properest man in all the world to be King," she whispered.  "I refused to touch the trade till they had given me the Queen I desired, safe and alive, here upon the Mountain."  "How we poor women are made the chattels of you men!  But, for myself, I seem to like the traffic well enough.  You should not have let me stand in the way of Atlantis' good, Deucalion.  Still, it is very sweet to know you were weak there for once, and that I was the cause of your weakness.  What is that bath over yonder?  Ah!  I remember; my wits seem none of the clearest just now."  "You have made the beginning.  Your strength will return to you by quick degrees.  But it will not bear hurrying.  You must have a patience."  "Your ear, sir, for one moment, and then I will rest in peace.  My poor looks, are they all gone?  You seem to have no mirror here.  I had visions that I should wake up wrinkled and old."  "You are as you were, dear, that first night I saw you--the most beautiful woman in all the world."  "I am pleased you like me," she said, and took the cup of broth I offered her.  "My hair seems to have grown; but it needs combing sadly.  I had a fancy, dear, once, that you liked ruddy hair best, and not a plain brown."  She closed her eyes then, lying back amongst the cushions where I had placed her, and dropped off into healthy sleep, with the smiles still playing upon her lips.  I put the coverlet over her, and kissed her lightly, holding back my beard lest it should sweep her cheek.  And then I went out of the chamber.  That beard had grown vastly disagreeable to me these last hours, and then I went into a room in the house, and found instruments, and shaved it down to the bare chin.  A change of robe also I found there and took it instead of my squalid rags.  If a man is in truth a king, he owes these things to the dignity of his office.  But, if the din of the fighting was any guide, mine was a narrowing kingdom.  Every hour it seemed to grow fiercer and more near, and it was clear that some of the gates in the passage up the cleft in the cliff, impregnable though all men had thought them, had yielded to the vehemence of Phorenice's attack.  And, indeed, it was scarcely to be marvelled at.  With all her genius spurred on to fury by the blow that had been struck at her by wrecking so fair a part of the city, the Empress would be no light adversary even for a strong place to resist, and the Sacred Mountain was no longer strong.  Defences of stone, cunningly planned and mightily built, it still possessed, but these will not fight alone.  They need men to line them, and, moreover, abundance of men.  For always in a storm of this kind, some desperate fellows will spit at death and get to hand grips, or slingers and archers slip in their shot, or the throwing-fire gets home, or (as here) some newfangled machine like Phorenice's fire-tubes, make one in a thousand of their wavering darts find the life; and so, though the general attacking loses his hundreds, the defenders also are not without their dead.  The slaughter, as it turned out, had been prodigious.  As fast as the stormers came up, the Priests who held the lowest gate remaining to us rained down great rocks upon them till the narrow alley of the stair was paved with their writhing dead.  But Phorenice stood on a spur of the rock below them urging on the charges, and with an insane valour company after company marched up to hurl themselves hopelessly against the defences.  They had no machines to batter the massive gates, and their attack was as pathetically useless as that of a child who hammers against a wall with an orange; and meanwhile the terrible stones from above mowed them down remorselessly.  Company after company of the troops marched into this terrible death-trap, and not a man of all of them ever came back.  Nor was it Phorenice's policy that they should do so.  In her lust for this final conquest, she was minded to pour out troops till she had filled up the passes with the slain, so that at last she might march on to a level fight over the bridge of their poor bodies.  It was no part of Phorenice's mood ever to count the cost.  She set down the object which was to be gained, and it was her policy that the people of Atlantis were there to gain it for her.  Two gates then had she carried in this dreadful fashion, slaughtering those Priests that stood behind, them who had not been already shot down.  And here I came down from above to take my share in the fight.  There was no trumpet to announce my coming, no herald to proclaim my quality, but the Priests as a sheer custom picked up "Deucalion!" as a battle-cry; and some shouted that, with a King to lead, there would be no further ground lost.  It was clear that the name carried to the other side and bore weight with it.  A company of poor, doomed wretches who were hurrying up stopped in their charge.  The word "Deucalion!" was bandied round and handed back down the line.  I though with some grim satisfaction, that here was evidence I was not completely forgotten in the land.  There came shouts to them from behind to carry on their advance; but they did not budge; and presently a glittering officer panted up, and commenced to strike right and left amongst them with his sword.  From where I stood on the high rampart above the gate, I could see him plainly, and recognised him at once.  "It matters not what they use for their battle-cry," he was shouting.  "You have the orders of your divine Empress, and that is enough.  You should be proud to die for her wish, you cowards.  And if you do not obey, you will die afterwards under the instruments of the tormentors, very painfully.  As for Deucalion, he is dead any time these nine years."  "There it seems you lie, my Lord Tatho," I shouted down to him.  He started, and looked up at me.  "So you are there in real truth, then?  Well, old comrade, I am sorry.  But it is too late to make a composition now.  You are on the side of these mangy Priests, and the Empress has made an edict that they are to be rooted out, and I am her most obedient servant."  "You used to be skilful of fence," I said, and indeed there was little enough to choose between us.  "If it please you to stop this pitiful killing, make yourself the champion of your side, and I will stand for mine, and we will fight out this quarrel in some fair place, and bind our parties to abide by the result."  "It would be a grand fight between us two, old friend, and it goes hard with me to balk you of it.  But I cannot pleasure you.  I am general here under Phorenice, and she has given me the strongest orders not to peril myself.  And besides, though you are a great man, Deucalion, you are not chief.  You are not even one of the Three."  "I am King."  Tatho laughed.  "Few but yourself would say so, my lord."  "Few truly, but what there are, they are powerful.  I was given the name for the first time yesterday, and as a first blow in the campaign there was some mischief done in the city.  I was there myself, and saw how you took it."  "You were in Atlantis!"  "I went for Nais.  She is on the mountain now, and to-morrow will be my Queen.  Tatho, as a priest to a priest, let me solemnly bring to your memory the infinite power you bite against on this Sacred Mountain.  Your teaching has warned you of the weapons that are stored in the Ark of the Mysteries.  If you persist in this attack, at the best you can merely lose; at the worst you can bring about a wreck over which even the High Gods will shudder as They order it."  "You cannot scare us back now by words," said Tatho doggedly.  "And as for magic, it will be met by magic.  Phorenice has found by her own cleverness as many powers as were ever stored up in the Ark of the Mysteries."  "Yet she looked on helplessly enough last night, when her royal pyramid was trundled into a rubbish heap.  Zaemon had prophesied that this should be so, and for a witness, why I myself stood closer to her than we two stand now, and saw her."  "I will own you took her by surprise somewhat there.  I do not understand these matters myself; I was never more than one of the Seven in the old days; and now, quite rightly, Phorenice keeps the knowledge of her magic to herself: but it seems time is needed when one magic is to be met by another."  "Well," I said, "I know little about the business either.  I leave these matters now to those who are higher above me in the priesthood.  Indeed, having a liking for Nais, it seems I am debarred from ever being given understanding about the highest of the higher Mysteries.  So I content myself with being a soldier, and when the appointed day comes, I shall fall and kiss my mother the Earth for the last time.  You, so I am told, have ambition for longer life."  He nodded.  "Phorenice has found the Great Secret, and I am to be the first that will share it with her.  We shall be as Gods upon the earth, seeing that Death will be powerless to touch us.  And the twin sons she has borne me, will be made immortal also."  "Phorenice is headstrong.  No, my lord, there is no need to shake your head and try to deny it.  I have had some acquaintance with her.  But the order has been made, and her immortality will be snatched from her very rudely.  Now, mark solemnly my words.  I, Deucalion, have been appointed King of Atlantis by the High Council of the Priests who are the mouthpiece of the most High Gods, and if I do not have my reign, then there will be no Atlantis left to carry either King or Empress.  You know me, Tatho, for a man that never lies."  He nodded.  "Then save yourself before it is too late.  You shall have again your vice-royalty in Yucatan."  "But, man, there is no Yucatan.  A great horde of little hairy creatures, that were something less than human and something more than beasts, swept down upon our cities and ate them out.  Oh, you may sneer if you choose!  Others sneered when I came home, till the Empress stopped them.  But you know what a train of driver ants is, that you meet with in the forests?  You may light fires across their path, and they will march into them in their blind bravery, and put them out with their bodies, and those that are left will march on in an unbroken column, and devour all that stands in their path.  I tell you, my lord, those little hairy creatures were like the ants--aye, for numbers, and wooden bravery, as well as for appetite.  As a result to-day, there is no Yucatan."  "You shall have Egypt, then."  He burst at me hotly.  "I would not take seven Egypts and ten Yucatans.  My lord, you think more poorly of me than is kind, when you ask me to become a traitor.  In your place would you throw your Nais away, if the doing it would save you from a danger?"  "That is different."  "In no degree.  You have a kindness for her.  I have all that and more for Phorenice, who is, besides, my wife and the mother of my children.  If I have qualms--and I freely confess I know you are desperate men up there, and have dreadful powers at your command--my shiverings are for them and not for myself.  But I think, my lord, this parley is leading to nothing, and though these common soldiers here will understand little enough of our talk, they may be picking up a word here and there, and I do not wish them to go on to their death (as you will see them do shortly) and carry evil reports about me to whatever Gods they chance to come before."  He saluted me with his sword and drew back, and once more the missiles began to fly, and the doomed wretches, who had been halting beside the steep rock walls of the pass began once more to press hopelessly forward.  They had scaling-ladders certainly, but they had no chance of getting these planted.  They could do naught but fill the narrow way with their bodies, and to that end they had been sent, and to that end they humbly died.  Our Priests with crow and lever wrenched from their lodging-places the great rocks which had been made ready, and sent them crashing down, so that once more screams filled the pass, and the horrid butchery was renewed.  But ever and again, some arrow or some sling-stone, or some fire-tube's dart would find its way up from below and through the defences, and there we would be with a man the less to carry on the fight.  It was well enough for Phorenice to be lavish with her troops; indeed, if she wished for success, there were no two ways for it; and when those she had levied were killed, she could readily press others into the service, seeing that she had the whole broad face of the country under her rule.  But with us it was different.  A man down on our side was a man whose arm would bitterly be missed, and one which could in no possible way be replaced.  I made calculation of the chances, and saw clearly that, if we continued the fight on the present plan, they would storm the gates one after another as they came to them, and that by the time the uppermost gate was reached, there would be no Priest alive to defend it.  And so, not disdaining to fashion myself on Phorenice's newer plan, which held that a general should at times in preference plot coldly from a place of some safety, and not lead the thick of the fighting, I left those who stood to the gate with some rough soldier's words of cheer, and withdrew again up the narrow stair of the pass.  This one approach to the Sacred Mountain was, as I have said before, vastly more difficult and dangerous in the olden days when it stood as a mere bare cleft as the High Gods made it.  But a chasm had been bridged here, a shelf cut through the solid rock there, and in many places the roadway was built up on piers from distant crags below so as to make all uniform and easy.  It came to my mind now, that if I could destroy this path, we might gain a breathing space for further effort.  The idea seemed good, or at least no other occurred to me which would in any way relieve our desperate situation, and I looked around me for means to put it into execution.  Up and down, from the mountain to the plains below, I had traversed that narrow stair of a pass some thousands of times, and so in a manner of speaking knew every stone, and every turn, and every cut of it by heart.  But I had never looked upon it with an eye to shaving off all roadway to the Sacred Mountain, and so now, even in this moment of dreadful stress, I had to traverse it no less than three times afresh before I could decide upon the best site for demolition.  But once the point was fixed, there was little delay in getting the scheme in movement.  Already I had sent men to the storehouses amongst the Priests' dwellings to fetch me rams, and crows, and acids, and hammers, and such other material as was needed, and these stood handy behind one of the upper gates.  I put on every pair of hands that could be spared to the work, no matter what was their age and feebleness; yes, if Nais could have walked so far I would have pressed her for the labour; and presently carved balustrade, and wayside statue, together with the lettered wall-stones and the foot-worn cobbles, roared down into the gulf below, and added their din to the shrieks and yells and crashes of the fighting.  Gods!  But it was a hateful task, smashing down that splendid handiwork of the men of the past.  But it was better that it should crash down to ruin in the abyss below, than that Phorenice should profane it with her impious sandals.  At first I had feared that it would be needful to sacrifice the knot of brave men who were so valiantly defending the gate then being attacked.  It is disgusting to be forced into a measure of this kind, but in hard warfare it is often needful to the carrying out of his schemes for a general to leave a part of his troops to fight to a finish, and without hope of rescue, as valiantly as they may; and all he can do for their reward is to recommend them earnestly to the care of the Gods.  But when the work of destroying the pathway was nearly completed, I saw a chance of retrieving them.  We had not been content merely with breaking arches, and throwing down the piers.  We had got our rams and levers under the living rock itself on which all the whole fabric stood; and fire stood ready to heat the rams for their work; and when the word was given, the whole could be sent crashing down the face of the cliffs beyond chance of repair.  All was, I say, finally prepared in this fashion, and then I gave the word to hold.  A narrow ledge still remained undestroyed, and offered footway, and over this I crossed.  The cut we had made was immediately below the uppermost gate of all, and below it there were three more massive gates still unviolated, besides the one then being so vehemently attacked.  Already, the garrisons had been retired from these, and I passed through them all in turn, unchallenged and unchecked, and came to that busy rampart where the twelve Priests left alive worked, stripped to the waist, at heaving down the murderous rocks.  For awhile I busied myself at their side, stopping an occasional fire-tube dart or arrow on my shield and passing them the tidings.  The attack was growing fiercer every minute now.  The enemy had packed the pass below well-nigh full of their dead, and our battering stones had less distance to fall and so could do less execution.  They pressed forward more eagerly than ever with their scaling ladders, and it was plain that soon they would inevitably put the place to the storm.  Even during the short time I was there, their sling-stones and missiles took life from three more of the twelve who stood with me on the defence.  So I gave the word for one more furious avalanche of rock to be pelted down, and whilst the few living were crawling out from those killed by the discharge, and whilst the next band of reinforcements came scrambling up over the bodies, I sent my nine remaining men away at a run up the steep stairway of the path, and then followed them myself.  Each of the gates in turn we passed, shutting them after us, and breaking the bars and levers with which they were moved, and not till we were through the last did the roar of shouts from below tell that the besiegers had found the gate they bit against was deserted.  One by one we balanced our way across the narrow ledge which was left where the path had been destroyed, and one poor Priest that carried a wound grew giddy, and lost his balance here, and toppled down to his death in the abyss below before a hand could be stretched out to steady him.  And then, when we were all over, heat was put to the rams, and they expanded with their resistless force, and tore the remaining ledges from their hold in the rock.  I think a pang went through us all then when we saw for ourselves the last connecting link cut away from between the poor remaining handful of our Sacred Clan on the Mountain, and the rest of our great nation, who had grown so bitterly estranged to us, below.  But here at any rate was a break in the fighting.  There were no further preparations we could make for our defence, and high though I knew Phorenice's genius to be, I did not see how she could very well do other than accept the check and retire.  So I set a guard on the ramparts of the uppermost gate to watch all possible movements, and gave the word to the others to go and find the rest which so much they needed.  For myself, dutifully I tried to find Zaemon first, going on the errand my proper self, for there was little enough of kingly state observed on the Sacred Mountain, although the name and title had been given me.  But Zaemon was not to be come at.  He was engaged inside the Ark of the Mysteries with another of the Three, and being myself only one of the Seven, I had not rank enough in the priesthood to break in upon their workings.  And so I was free to turn where my likings would have led me first, and that was to the house which sheltered Nais.  She waked as I came in over the threshold, and her eyes filled with a welcome for me.  I went across and knelt where she lay, putting my face on the pillow beside her.  She was full of tender talk and sweet endearments.  Gods!  What an infinity of delight I had missed by not knowing my Nais earlier!  But she had a will of her own through it all, and some quaint conceits which made her all the more adorable.  She rallied me on the new cleanness of my chin, and on the robe which I had taken as a covering.  She professed a pretty awe for my kingship, and vowed that had she known of my coming dignities she would never have dared to discover a love for me.  But about my marriage with Phorenice she spoke with less lightness.  She put out her thin white hand, and drew my face to her lips.  "It is weak of me to have a jealousy," she murmured, "knowing how completely my lord is mine alone; but I cannot help it.  You have said you were her husband for awhile.  It gives me a pang to think that I shall not be the first to lie in your arms, Deucalion."  "Then you may gaily throw your pang away," I whispered back.  "I was husband to Phorenice in mere word for how long I do not precisely know.  But in anything beyond, I was never her husband at all.  She married me by a form she prescribed herself, ignoring all the old rites and ceremonies, and whether it would hold as legal or not, we need not trouble to inquire.  She herself has most nicely and completely annulled that marriage as I have told you.  Tatho is her husband now, and father to her children, and he seems to have a fondness for her which does him credit."  We said other things too in that chamber, those small repetitions of endearments which are so precious to lovers, and so beyond the comprehension of other folk, but they are not to be set down on these sheets.  They are a mere private matter which can have no concern to any one beyond our two selves, and more weighty subjects are piling themselves up in deep index for the historian.  Phorenice, it seemed, had more rage against the Priests' Clan on the Mountain and more bright genius to help her to a vengeance than I had credited.  Her troops stormed easily the gates we had left to them, and swarmed up till they stood where the pathway was broken down.  In the fierceness of their rush, the foremost were thrust over the brink by those pressing up behind, before the advance could be halted, and these went screaming to a horrid death in the great gulf below.  But it was no position here that a lavish spending of men could take, and presently all were drawn off, save for some half-score who stood as outpost sentries, and dodged out of arrow-shot behind angles of the rock.  It seems, too, that the Empress herself reconnoitered the place, using due caution and quickness, and so got for herself a full plan of its requirements without being obliged to trust the measuring of another eye.  With extraordinary nimbleness she must have planned an engine such as was necessary to suit her purposes, and given orders for its making; for even with the vast force and resources at her disposal, the speed with which it was built was prodigious.  There was very little noise made to tell of what was afoot.  All the woodwork and metalwork was cut, and tongued, and forged, and fitted first by skilled craftsmen below, in the plain at the foot of the cleft; and when each ponderous balk and each crosspiece, and each plank was dragged up the steep pass through the conquered gates, it was ready instantly for fitting into its appointed place in the completed machine.  The cleft was straight where they set about their building, and there was no curve or spur of the cliff to hide their handiwork from those of the Priests who watched from the ramparts above our one remaining gate.  But Phorenice had a coyness lest her engine should be seen before it was completed, and so to screen it she had a vast fire built at the uppermost point where the causeway was broken off, and fed diligently with wet sedge and green wood, so that a great smoke poured out, rising like a curtain that shut out all view.  And so though the Priests on the rampart above the gate picked off now and again some of those who tended the fire, they could do the besiegers no further injury, and remained up to the last quite in ignorance of their tactics.  The passage up the cleft was in shadow during the night hours, for, though all the crest of the Sacred Mountain was always lit brightly by the eternal fires which made its defence on the farther side, their glow threw no gleam down that flank where the cliff ran sheer to the plains beneath.  And so it was under cover of the darkness that Phorenice brought up her engine into position for attack.  Planking had been laid down for its wheels, and the wheels themselves well greased, and it may be that she hoped to march in upon us whilst all slept.  But there was a certain creaking and groaning of timbers, and laboured panting of men, which gave advertisement that something was being attempted, and the alarm was spread quietly in the hope that if a surprise had been planned, the real surprise might be turned the other way.  A messenger came to me running, where I sat in the house at the side of my love, and she, like the soldier's wife she was made to be, kissed me and bade me go quickly and care for my honour, and bring back my wounds for her to mend.  On the rampart above the gate all was silence, save for the faint rustle of armed men, and out of the black darkness ahead, and from the other side of the broken causeway, came the sounds of which the messenger bad warned me.  The captain of the gate came to me and whispered: "We have made no light till the King came, not knowing the King's will in the matter.  Is it wished I send some of the throwing-fire down yonder, on the chance that it does some harm, and at the same time lights up the place?  Or is it willed that we wait for their surprise?"  "Send the fire," I said, "or we may find that Phorenice's brain has been one too many for us."  The captain of the gate took one of the balls in his hand, lit the fuse, and hurled it.  The horrid thing burst amongst a mass of men who were labouring with a huge engine, sputtering them with its deadly fire, and lighting their garments.  The plan of the engine showed itself plainly.  They had built them a vast great tower, resting on wheels at its base, so that it might by pushed forward from behind, and slanting at its foot to allow for the steepness of the path and leave it always upright.  It was storeyed inside, with ladders joining each floor, and through slits in the side which faced us bowmen could cover an attack.  From its top a great bridge reared high above it, being carried vertically till the tower was brought near enough for its use.  The bridge was hinged at the third storey of the tower, and fastened with ropes to its extreme top; but, once the ropes were cut, the bridge would fall, and light upon whatever came within its swing, and be held there by the spikes with which it was studded beneath.  I saw, and inwardly felt myself conquered.  The cleverness of Phorenice had been too strong for my defence.  No war-engine of which we had command could overset the tower.  The whole of its massive timbers were hung with the wet new-stripped skins of beasts, so that even the throwing-fire could not destroy it.  What puny means we had to impede those who pushed it forward would have little effect.  Presently it would come to the place appointed, and the ropes would be cut, and the bridge would thunder down on the rampart above our last gate, and the stormers would pour out to their final success.  Well, life had loomed very pleasant for me these few days with a warm and loving Nais once more in touch of my arms, but the High Gods in Their infinite wisdom knew best always, and I was no rebel to stay stiff-necked against their decision.  But it is ever a soldier's privilege, come what may, to warm over a fight, and the most exquisitely fierce joy of all is that final fight of a man who knows that he must die, and who lusts only to make his bed of slain high enough to carry a due memory of his powers with those who afterwards come to gaze upon it.  I gripped my axe, and the muscles of my arms stood out in knots at the thought of it.  Would Tatho come to give me sport?  I feared not.  They would send only the common soldiers first to the storm, and I must be content to do my killing on those.  And Nais, what of her?  I had a quiet mind there.  When any spoilers came to the house where she lay, she would know that Deucalion had been taken up to the Gods, and she would not be long in following him.  She had her dagger.  No, I had no fears of being parted long from Nais now.    19.  DESTRUCTION OF ATLANTIS   A tottering old Priest came up and touched me on the shoulder.  "Well?" I said sharply, having small taste for interruption just now.  "News has been carried to the Three, my King, of what is threatened."  "Then they will know that I stand here now, brother, to enjoy the finest fight of my life.  When it is finished I shall go to the Gods, and be there standing behind the stars to welcome them when presently they also arrive.  They have my regrets that they are too old and too feeble to die and look upon a fine killing themselves."  "I have commands from them, my King, to lay upon you, which I fear you will like but slenderly.  You are forbidden to find your death here in the fighting.  They have a further use for you yet."  I turned on the old man angrily enough.  "I shall take no such order, my brother.  I am not going to believe it was ever given.  You must have misunderstood.  If I am a man, if I am a Priest, if I am a soldier, if I am a King, then it stands to my honour that no enemy should pass this gate whilst yet I live.  And you may go back and throw that message at their teeth."  The old man smiled enviously.  He, too, had been a keen soldier in his day.  "I told them you would not easily believe such a message, and asked them for a sign, and they bore with me, and gave me one.  I was to give you this jewel, my King."  "How came they by that?  It is a bracelet from the elbow of Nais."  "They must have stripped her of it.  I did not know it came from Nais.  The word I was to bring you said that the owner of the jewel was inside the Ark of the Mysteries, and waited you there.  The use which the Three have for you further concerns her also."  Even when I heard that, I will freely confess that my obedience was sorely tried, and I have the less shame in setting it down on these sheets, because I know that all true soldiers will feel a sympathy for my plight.  Indeed, the promise of the battle was very tempting.  But in the end my love for Nais prevailed, and I gave the salutation that was needful in token that I heard the order and obeyed it.  To the knot of Priests who were left for the defence, I turned and made my farewells.  "You will have what I shall miss, my brothers," I said.  "I envy you that fight.  But, though I am King of Atlantis, still I am only one of the Seven, and so am the servant of the Three and must obey their order.  They speak in words the will of the most High Gods, and we must do as they command.  You will stand behind the stars before I come, and I ask of you that you will commend me to Those you meet there.  It is not my own will that I shall not appear there by your side."  They heard my words with smiles, and very courteously saluted me with their weapons, and there we parted.  I did not see the fight, but I know it was good, from the time which passed before Phorenice's hordes broke out on to the crest of the Mountain.  They died hard, that last remnant of the lesser Priests of Atlantis.  With a sour enough feeling I went up to the head of the pass, and then through the groves, and between the temples and colleges and houses which stood on the upper slopes of the Sacred Mountain, till I reached that boundary, beyond which in milder days it was death for any but the privileged few to pass.  But the time, it appeared to me, was past for conventions, and, moreover, my own temper was hot; and it is likely that I should have strode on with little scruple if I had not been interrupted.  But in the temple which marked the boundary, there was old Zaemon waiting; and he, with due solemnity of words, and with the whole of some ancient ritual ordained for that purpose, sought dispensation from the High Gods for my trespass, and would not give me way till he was through with his ceremony.  Already Phorenice's tower and bridge were in position, for the clash and yelling of a fight told that the small handful of Priests on the rampart of the last gate were bartering their lives for the highest return in dead that they could earn.  They were trained fighting men all, but old and feeble, and the odds against them were too enormous to be stemmed for over long.  In a very short time the place would be put to the storm, and the roof of the Sacred Mountain would be at the open mercy of the invader.  If there was any further thing to be done, it was well that it should be set about quickly whilst peace remained. It seemed to me that the moment for prompt action, and the time for lengthy pompous ceremonial was done for good.  But Zaemon was minded otherwise. He led me up to the Ark of the Mysteries, and chided my impatience, and waited till I had given it my reverential kiss, and then he called aloud, and another old man came out of the opening which is in the top of the Ark, and climbed painfully down by the battens which are fixed on its sides.  He was a man I had never seen before, hoary, frail, and emaciated, and he and Zaemon were then the only two remaining Priests who had been raised to the highest degree known to our Clan, and who alone had knowledge of the highest secrets and powers and mysteries.  "Look!" cried Zaemon, in his shrill old voice, and swept a trembling finger over the shattered city, and the great spread of sea and country which lay in view of us below.  I followed his pointing and looked, and a chill began to crawl through me.  All was plainly shown.  Our Lord the Sun burned high overhead in a sky of cloudless blue, and day shimmered in His heat.  All below seemed from that distance peaceful and warm and still, save only that the mountains smoked more than ordinary, and some spouted fires, and that the sea boiled with some strange disorder.  But it was the significance of the sea that troubled me most.  Far out on the distant coast it surged against the rocks in enormous rolls of surf; and up the great estuary, at the head of which the city of Atlantis stands, it gushed in successive waves of enormous height which never returned.  Already the lower lands on either side were blotted out beneath tumultuous waters, the harbour walls were drowned out of sight, and the flood was creeping up into the lower wards of the great city itself.  "You have seen?" asked Zaemon.  "I have seen."  "You understand?"  "ln part."  "Then let me tell you all.  This is the beginning, and the end will follow swiftly.  The most High Gods, that sit behind the stars, have a limit to even Their sublime patience; and that has been passed.  The city of Atlantis, the great continent that is beyond, and all that are in them are doomed to unutterable destruction.  Of old it was foreseen that this great wiping-out would happen through the sins of men, and to this end the Ark of the Mysteries was built under the direction of the Gods.  No mortal implements can so much as scratch its surface, no waves or rocks wreck it.  Inside is stored on sheets of the ancient writing all that is known in the world of learning that is not shared by the common people, also there is grain in a store, and sweet water in tanks sufficient for two persons for the space of four years, together with seeds, weapons, and all such other matters as were deemed fit.  "Out of all this vast country it has been decreed by the High Gods that two shall not perish.  Two shall be chosen, a man and a woman, who are fit and proper persons to carry away with them the ancient learning to dispose of it as they see best, and afterwards to rear up a race who shall in time build another kingdom and do honour to our Lord the Sun and the other Gods in another place.  The woman is within the Ark already, and seated in the place appointed for her, and though she is a daughter of mine, the burden of her choosing is with you.  For the man, the choice has fallen upon yourself."  I was half numb with the shock of what was befalling.  "I do not know that I care to be a survivor."  "You are not asked for your wishes," said the old man.  "You are given an order from the High Gods, who know you to be Their faithful servant."  Habit rode strong upon me.  I made salutation in the required form, and said that I heard and would obey.  "Then it remains to raise you to the sublime degree of the Three, and if your learning is so small that you will not understand the keys to many of the Powers, and the highest of the Mysteries, when they are handed to you, that fault cannot be remedied now."  Certainly the time remaining was short enough.  The fight still raged down at the gate in the pass, though it was a wonder how the handful of Priests had held their ground so long.  But the ocean rolled in upon the land in an ever-increasing flood, and the mountains smoked and belched forth more volleys of rock as the weight increased on their lower parts, and presently those that besieged the Mountain could not fail to see the fate that threatened them.  Then there would be no withholding their rush.  In their mad fury and panic they would sweep all obstruction resistlessly before them, and those who stood in their path might look to themselves.  But there was no hurrying Zaemon and his fellow sage.  They were without temple for the ceremony, without sacrifice or incense to decorate it.  They had but the sky for a roof to make their echoes, and the Gods themselves for witnesses.  But they went through the work of raising me to their own degree, with all the grand and majestic form which has gathered dignity from the ages, and by no one sentence did they curtail it. A burning mountain burst with a bellowing roar as the incoming waters met its fires, but gravely they went on, in turn reciting their sentences.  Phorenice's troops broke down the last resistance, and poured in a frenzied stream amongst the groves and temples, but still they quavered never in the ritual.  It had been said that this ceremony is the grandest and the most impressive of all those connected with our holy religion; and certainly I found it so; and I speak as one intimate with all the others.  Even the tremendous circumstances which hemmed them in could do nothing to make these frail old men forget the deference which was due to the highest order of the Clan.  For myself, I will freely own I was less rapt.  I stood there bareheaded in the heat, a man trying to concentrate himself, and yet torn the while by a thousand foreign emotions.  The awful thing that was happening all around compelled some of my attention.  A continent was in the very act and article of meeting with complete destruction, and if Zaemon and the other Priest were strong enough to give their minds wholly up to a matter parochial to the priesthood, I was not so stoical.  And moreover, I was filled with other anxieties and thoughts concerning Nais.  Yet I managed to preserve a decent show of attention to the ceremony; making all those responses which were required of me; and trying as well as might be to preserve in my mind those sentences which were the keys to power and learning, and not mere phrasings of grandeur and devotion.  But it became clear that if the ceremony of my raising did not soon arrive at its natural end, it would be cut short presently with something of suddenness.  Phorenice's conquering legions swarmed out on to the crest of the Mountain, and now carried full knowledge of the dreadful thing that was come upon the country.  They were out of all control, and ran about like men distracted; but knowing full well that the Priests would have brought this terrible wreck to pass by virtue of the powers which were stored within the Ark of the Mysteries, it would be their natural impulse to pour out a final vengeance upon any of these same Priests they could come across before it was too late.  It began to come to my mind that if the ceremony did not very shortly terminate, the further part of the plan would stand very small chance of completion, and I should come by my death after all by fighting to a finish, as I had pictured to myself before.  My flickering attention saw the soldiers coming always nearer in their frantic wanderings, and saw also the sea below rolling deeper and deeper in upon the land.  The fires, too, which ringed in half the mountain, spurted up to double their old height, and burned with an unceasing roar.  But for all distraction these things gave to the two old Priests who were raising me, we might have been in the quietness of some ancient temple, with no so much as a fly to buzz an interruption.  But at last an end came to the ceremony.  "Kneel," cried Zaemon, "and make obeisance to your mother the Earth, and swear by the High Gods that you will never make improper use of the powers over Her which this day you have been granted."  When I had done that, he bade me rise as a fully installed and duly initiated member of the Three.  "You will have no opportunity to practise the workings of this degree with either of us, my brother," said he, "for presently our other brother and I go to stand before the Gods to deliver to Them an account of our trust, and of how we have carried it out.  But what items you remember here and there may turn of use to you hereafter.  And now we two give you our farewells, and promise to commend you highly to the Gods when soon we meet Them in Their place behind the stars.  Climb now into the Ark, and be ready to shut the door which guards it, if there is any attempt by these raging people to invade that also.  Remember, my brother, it is the Gods' direct will that you and the woman Nais go from this place living and sound, and you are expressly forbidden to accept challenge or provocation to fight on any pretext whatever.  But as long as may be done in safety, you may look out upon Atlantis in her death-throes.  It is very fitting that one of the only two who are sent hence alive, should carry the full tale of what has befallen."  I went to the top of the Ark of Mysteries then, climbing there by the battens which are fastened to the sides, and then descended by the stair which is inside and found Nais in a little chamber waiting for me.  "I was bidden stay here by Zaemon," she said, "who forced me to this place by threats and also by promises that my lord would follow.  He is very ungentle, that father of mine, but I think he has a kindness for us both, and any way he is my father and I cannot help loving him.  Is there no chance to save him from what is going to happen?"  "He will not come into this Ark, for I asked him.  It has been ordained from the ancient time when first the Ark was built, that when the day for its purpose came, one woman and one man should be its only tenants, and they are here already.  Zaemon's will in the matter is not to be twisted by you or by me.  He has a message to be delivered to the Gods, and (if I know him at all), he grudges every minute that is lost in carrying it to them."  I left her then, and went out again up the stair, and stood once more on the roof of the Ark.  On the Mountain top men still ran about distracted, but gradually they were coming to where the Ark rested on the highest point.  For the moment, however, I passed them lightly.  The drowning of the great continent that had been spread out below filled the eye.  Ocean roared in upon it with still more furious waves.  The plains  and the level lands were foaming lakes.  The great city of Atlantis had vanished eternally.  The mountains alone kept their heads above the flood, and spewed out rocks, and steam, and boiling stone, or burst when the waters reached them and created great whirlpools of surging sea, and twisted trees, and bubbling mud.  In the space of a few breaths every living creature that dwelt in the lower grounds had been smothered by the waters, save for a few who huddled in a pair of galleys that were driven oarless inland, over what had once been black forest and hunting land for the beasts.  And even as I watched, these also were swallowed up by the horrid turmoil of sea, and nothing but the sea beasts, and those of the greater lizards which can live in such outrageous waters, could have survived even that state of the destruction.  Indeed, none but those men who had now found standing-ground on the upper slopes of the Sacred Mountain survived, and it was plain that their span was short, for the great mass of the continent sank deeper and more deep every minute before our aching eyes, beneath the boiling inrush of the seas.  But though the great mass of the soldiery were dazed and maddened at the prospect of the overwhelming which threatened them, there were some with a strength of mind too valiant to give any outward show of discomposure.  Presently a compact little body of people came from out the houses and the temples, and headed directly across the open ground towards the Ark.  On the outside marched Phorenice's personal guards with their weapons new blooded.  They had been forced to fight a way through their own fellow soldiers.  The poor demented creatures had thought it was every one for himself now, till these guards (by their mistress's order) proved to them that Phorenice still came first.  And in the middle of them, borne in a litter of gold and ivory by her grotesque European slaves, rode the Empress, still calm, still lovely, and seemingly divided in her sentiments between contempt and amusement.  Her two children lay in the litter at her feet.  On her right hand marched Tatho gorgeously apparelled, and with a beard curled and plaited into a thousand ringlets.  On the other side, plying her industry with unruffled defence, walked Ylga, once again fan-girl, and so still second lady in this dwindling kingdom.  The party of them halted half a score of paces from the Ark by Phorenice's order.  "Do not go nearer to those unclean old men.  They carry a rank odour with them, and for the moment we are short of essences to sweeten the air of their neighbourhood."  She lifted her eyebrows and looked up at me.  "Truly a quiet little gathering of old acquaintances.  Why, there is Deucalion, that once I took the flavour of and threw aside when he cloyed me."  "I have Nais here," I said, "and presently we two will be all that are left alive of this nation."  "Nais is quite welcome to my leavings," she laughed.  "I will look down upon your country cooings when presently I go back to the Place behind the stars from which I came.  You are a very rustic person, Deucalion.  They tell me too that three or four of these smelling old men up here have named you King.  Did you swell much with dignity?  Or did you remember that there was a pretty Empress left that would still be Empress so long as there was an Atlantis to govern?  Come, sir, find your tongue.  By my face! you must have hungered for me very madly these years we have been parted, if new-grown ruggedness of feature is an evidence."  "Have your gibe.  I do not gibe back at a woman who presently will die."  "Bah!  Deucalion, you will live behind the times.  Have they not told you that I know the Great Secret and am indeed a Goddess now?  My arts can make life run on eternally."  "Then the waters will presently test them hard," I said, but there the talk was taken into other lips.  Zaemon went forward to the front of the litter with the Symbol of our Lord the Sun glowing in his hand, and burst into a flow of cursing.  It was hard for me to hear his words.  The roar of the waters which poured up over the land, and beat in vast waves against the Sacred Mountain itself, grew nearer and more loud.  But the old man had his say.  Phorenice gave orders to her guards for his killing; yes, tried even to rise from the litter and do the work herself; but Zaemon held the Symbol to his front, and its power in that supreme moment mastered all the arts that could be brought against it.  The majesty of the most High Gods was vindicated, and that splendid Empress knew it and lay back sullenly amongst the cushions of her litter, a beaten woman.  Only one person in that rigid knot of people found power to leave the rest, and that was Ylga.  She came out to the side of the Ark, and leaned up, and cried me a farewell through the gathering roar of the flood.  "I would I might save you and take you with us," I said.  "As for that," she said, with a gesture, "I would not come if you asked me.  I am not a woman that will take anything less than all.  But I shall meet what comes presently with the memory that you will have me always somewhere in your recollection.  I know somewhat of men, even men of your stamp, Deucalion, and you will never forget that you came very near to loving me once."  I think, too, she said something further, concerning Nais, but the bellowing rush of the waters drowned all other words.  A great mist made from the stream sent up by the swamped burning mountains stopped all accurate view, though the blaze from the fires lit it like gold.  But I had a last sight of a horde of soldiery rushing up the slopes of the Mountain, with a scum of surge billowing at their heels, and licking many of them back in its clutch.  And then my eye fell on old Zaemon waving to me with the Symbol to shut down the door in the roof of the Ark.  I obeyed his last command, and went down the stair, and closed all ingress behind me.  There were bolts placed ready, and I shot these into their sockets, and there were Nais and I alone, and cut off from all the rest of our world that remained.  I went to the place where she lay, and put my arms tightly around her.  Without, we heard men beating desperately on the Ark with their weapons, and some even climbed by the battens to the top and wrenched to try and move the door from its fastenings.  The end was coming very nearly to them now, and the great crowd of them were mad with terror.  I would have given much to have known how Phorenice fared in that final tumult, and how she faced it.  I could see her, with her lovely face, and her wondrous eyes, and her ruddy hair curling about her neck, and by all the Gods!  I thought more of her at that last moment than of the poor land she had conquered, and misgoverned, and brought to this horrid destruction.  There is no denying the fascination which Phorenice carried with her.  But the end did not dally long with its coming.  There was a little surge that lifted the Ark a hand's breadth or so in its cradle, and set it back again with a jar and a quiver.  The blows from axes and weapons ceased on its lower part, but  redoubled into frenzied batterings on its rounded roof.  There were some screams and cries also which came  to us but dully through the thickness of its ponderous sheathing, though likely enough they were sent forth at the full pitch of human lungs outside.  And when another surge came, roaring and thundering, which picked up the great vessel as though it had been a feather, and spun it giddily; and after that we touched earth or rock no more.  We tossed about on the crest and troughs of delirious seas, a sport for the greedy Gods of the ocean.  The lamp had fallen, and we crouched there in darkness, dully weighed with the burden of knowledge that we alone were saved out of what was yesterday a mighty nation.    20.  ON THE BOSOM OF THE DEEP   The Ark was rudderless, oarless, and machineless, and could travel only where the High Gods chose.  The inside was dark, and full of an ancient smell, and crowded with groanings and noise.  I could not find the fire-box to relight the fallen lamp, and so we had to endure blindly what was dealt out to us.  The waves tossed us in merciless sport, and I clung on by the side of Nais, holding her to the bed.  We did not speak much, but there was full companionship in our bereavement and our silence.  When Atlantis sank to form new ocean bed, she left great whirlpools and spoutings from her drowned fires as a fleeting legacy to the Gods of the Sea.  And then, I think (though in the black belly of the Ark we could not see these things), a vast hurricane of wind must have come on next so as to leave no piece of the desolation incomplete.  For seven nights and seven days did this dreadful turmoil continue, as counted for us afterwards by the reckoner of hours which hung within the Ark, and then the howling of the wind departed, and only the roll of a long still swell remained.  It was regular and it was oily, as I could tell by the difference of the motion, and then for the first time I dared to go up the stair, and open the door which stood in the roof of the Ark.  The sweet air came gushing down to freshen the foulness within, and as the Ark rode dryly over the seas, I went below and brought up Nais to gain refreshment from the curing rays of our Lord the Sun.  Duly the pair of us adored Him, and gave thanks for His great mercy in coming to light another day, and then we laid ourselves down where we were to doze, and take that easy rest which we so urgently needed.  Yet, though I was tired beyond words, for long enough sleep would not visit me.  Wearily I stared out over the oily sunlit waters.  No blur of land met the eye.  The ring of ocean was unbroken on every side, and overhead the vault of heaven remained unchanged.  The bosom of the deep was littered with the poor wreckage of Atlantis, to remind one, if there had been a need, that what had come about was fact, and not some horrid dream.  Trees, squared timber, a smashed and upturned boat of hides, and here and there the rounded corpse of a man or beast shouldered over the swells, and kept convoy with our Ark as she drifted on in charge of the Gods and the current.  But sleep came to me at last, and I dropped off into unconsciousness, holding the hand of Nais in mine, and when next I woke, I found her open-eyed also and watching me tenderly.  We were finely rested, both of us, and rest and strength bring one complacency.  We were more ready now to accept the station which the High Gods had made for us without repining, and so we went below again into the belly of the Ark to eat and drink and maintain strength for the new life which lay before us.  A wonderful vessel was this Ark, now we were able to see it at leisure and intimately.  Although for the first time now in all its centuries of life it swam upon the waters, it showed no leak or suncrack.  Inside, even its floor was bone dry.  That it was built from some wood, one could see by the grainings, but nowhere could one find suture or joint.  The living timbers had been put in place and then grown together by an art which we have lost to-day, but which the Ancients knew with much perfection; and afterwards some treatment, which is also a secret of those forgotten builders, had made the wood as hard as metal and impervious to all attacks of the weather.  In the gloomy cave of its belly were stored many matters.  At one end, in great tanks on either side of central alley, was a prodigious store of grain.  Sweet water was in other tanks at the other end.  In another place were drugs and samples, and essences of the life of beasts; all these things being for use whilst the Ark roamed under the guidance of the Gods on the bosom of the deep.  On all the walls of the Ark, and on all the partitions of the tanks and the other woodwork, there were carved in the rude art of bygone time representations of all the beasts which lived in Atlantis; and on these I looked with a hunter's interest, as some of them were strange to me, and had died out with the men who had perpetuated them in these sculptures.  There was a good store of weapons too and the tools for handicrafts.  Now, for many weeks, our life endured in this Ark as the Gods drove it about here and there across the face of the waters.  We had no government over direction; we could not by so much as a hair's breadth a day increase her speed.  The High Gods that had chosen the two of us to be the only ones saved out of all Atlantis, had sole control of our fate, and into Their hands we cheerfully resigned our future direction.  Of that land which we reached in due time, and where we made our abiding place, and where our children were born, I shall tell of in its place; but since this chronicle has proceeded so far in an exact order of the events as they came to pass, it is necessary first to narrate how we came by the sheets on which it is written.  In a great coffer, in the centre of the Ark's floor, the whole of the Mysteries learned during the study of ages were set down in accurate writing.  I read through some of them during the days which passed, and the awfulness of the Powers over which they gave control appalled me.  I had seen some of these Powers set loose in Atlantis, and was a witness of her destruction.  But here were Powers far higher than those; here was the great Secret of Life and Death which Phorenice also had found, and for which she had been destroyed; and there were other things also of which I cannot even bring my stylo to scribe.  The thought of being custodian of these writings was more than I could endure, and the more the matter rested in my mind, the more intolerable became the burden.  And at last I took hot irons, and with them seared the wax on the sheets till every letter of the old writings was obliterated.  If I did wrong, the High Gods in Their infinite justice will give me punishment; if it is well that these great secrets should endure on earth, They in their infinite power will dictate them afresh to some fitting scribes; but I destroyed them there as the Ark swayed with us over the waves; and later, when we came to land, I rewrote upon the sheets the matters which led to great Atlantis being dragged to her death-throes.  Nais, that I love so tenderly--Chapter I   This is the tale of Bradley after he left Fort Dinosaur upon the west coast of the great lake that is in the center of the island.  Upon the fourth day of September, 1916, he set out with four companions, Sinclair, Brady, James, and Tippet, to search along the base of the barrier cliffs for a point at which they might be scaled.  Through the heavy Caspakian air, beneath the swollen sun, the five men marched northwest from Fort Dinosaur, now waist-deep in lush, jungle grasses starred with myriad gorgeous blooms, now across open meadow-land and parklike expanses and again plunging into dense forests of eucalyptus and acacia and giant arboreous ferns with feathered fronds waving gently a hundred feet above their heads.  About them upon the ground, among the trees and in the air over them moved and swung and soared the countless forms of Caspak's teeming life.  Always were they menaced by some frightful thing and seldom were their rifles cool, yet even in the brief time they had dwelt upon Caprona they had become callous to danger, so that they swung along laughing and chatting like soldiers on a summer hike.  "This reminds me of South Clark Street," remarked Brady, who had once served on the traffic squad in Chicago; and as no one asked him why, he volunteered that it was "because it's no place for an Irishman."  "South Clark Street and heaven have something in common, then," suggested Sinclair.  James and Tippet laughed, and then a hideous growl broke from a dense thicket ahead and diverted their attention to other matters.  "One of them behemoths of 'Oly Writ," muttered Tippet as they came to a halt and with guns ready awaited the almost inevitable charge.  "Hungry lot o' beggars, these," said Bradley; "always trying to eat everything they see."  For a moment no further sound came from the thicket.  "He may be feeding now," suggested Bradley.  "We'll try to go around him. Can't waste ammunition.  Won't last forever.  Follow me."  And he set off at right angles to their former course, hoping to avert a charge.  They had taken a dozen steps, perhaps, when the thicket moved to the advance of the thing within it, the leafy branches parted, and the hideous head of a gigantic bear emerged.  "Pick your trees," whispered Bradley.  "Can't waste ammunition."  The men looked about them.  The bear took a couple of steps forward, still growling menacingly.  He was exposed to the shoulders now.  Tippet took one look at the monster and bolted for the nearest tree; and then the bear charged.  He charged straight for Tippet.  The other men scattered for the various trees they had selected--all except Bradley.  He stood watching Tippet and the bear.  The man had a good start and the tree was not far away; but the speed of the enormous creature behind him was something to marvel at, yet Tippet was in a fair way to make his sanctuary when his foot caught in a tangle of roots and down he went, his rifle flying from his hand and falling several yards away.  Instantly Bradley's piece was at his shoulder, there was a sharp report answered by a roar of mingled rage and pain from the carnivore.  Tippet attempted to scramble to his feet.  "Lie still!" shouted Bradley.  "Can't waste ammunition."  The bear halted in its tracks, wheeled toward Bradley and then back again toward Tippet.  Again the former's rifle spit angrily, and the bear turned again in his direction.  Bradley shouted loudly.  "Come on, you behemoth of Holy Writ!" he cried.  "Come on, you duffer!  Can't waste ammunition."  And as he saw the bear apparently upon the verge of deciding to charge him, he encouraged the idea by backing rapidly away, knowing that an angry beast will more often charge one who moves than one who lies still.  And the bear did charge.  Like a bolt of lightning he flashed down upon the Englishman.  "Now run!"  Bradley called to Tippet and himself turned in flight toward a nearby tree.  The other men, now safely ensconced upon various branches, watched the race with breathless interest.  Would Bradley make it?  It seemed scarce possible.  And if he didn't!  James gasped at the thought. Six feet at the shoulder stood the frightful mountain of blood-mad flesh and bone and sinew that was bearing down with the speed of an express train upon the seemingly slow-moving man.  It all happened in a few seconds; but they were seconds that seemed like hours to the men who watched.  They saw Tippet leap to his feet at Bradley's shouted warning.  They saw him run, stooping to recover his rifle as he passed the spot where it had fallen.  They saw him glance back toward Bradley, and then they saw him stop short of the tree that might have given him safety and turn back in the direction of the bear.  Firing as he ran, Tippet raced after the great cave bear--the monstrous thing that should have been extinct ages before--ran for it and fired even as the beast was almost upon Bradley.  The men in the trees scarcely breathed.  It seemed to them such a futile thing for Tippet to do, and Tippet of all men!  They had never looked upon Tippet as a coward--there seemed to be no cowards among that strangely assorted company that Fate had gathered together from the four corners of the earth--but Tippet was considered a cautious man.  Overcautious, some thought him.  How futile he and his little pop-gun appeared as he dashed after that living engine of destruction!  But, oh, how glorious!  It was some such thought as this that ran through Brady's mind, though articulated it might have been expressed otherwise, albeit more forcefully.  Just then it occurred to Brady to fire and he, too, opened upon the bear, but at the same instant the animal stumbled and fell forward, though still growling most fearsomely.  Tippet never stopped running or firing until he stood within a foot of the brute, which lay almost touching Bradley and was already struggling to regain its feet.  Placing the muzzle of his gun against the bear's ear, Tippet pulled the trigger.  The creature sank limply to the ground and Bradley scrambled to his feet.  "Good work, Tippet," he said.  "Mightily obliged to you--awful waste of ammunition, really."  And then they resumed the march and in fifteen minutes the encounter had ceased even to be a topic of conversation.  For two days they continued upon their perilous way.  Already the cliffs loomed high and forbidding close ahead without sign of break to encourage hope that somewhere they might be scaled. Late in the afternoon the party crossed a small stream of warm water upon the sluggishly moving surface of which floated countless millions of tiny green eggs surrounded by a light scum of the same color, though of a darker shade.  Their past experience of Caspak had taught them that they might expect to come upon a stagnant pool of warm water if they followed the stream to its source; but there they were almost certain to find some of Caspak's grotesque, manlike creatures.  Already since they had disembarked from the U-33 after its perilous trip through the subterranean channel beneath the barrier cliffs had brought them into the inland sea of Caspak, had they encountered what had appeared to be three distinct types of these creatures. There had been the pure apes--huge, gorillalike beasts--and those who walked, a trifle more erect and had features with just a shade more of the human cast about them.  Then there were men like Ahm, whom they had captured and confined at the fort--Ahm, the club-man.  "Well-known club-man," Tyler had called him.  Ahm and his people had knowledge of a speech.  They had a language, in which they were unlike the race just inferior to them, and they walked much more erect and were less hairy: but it was principally the fact that they possessed a spoken language and carried a weapon that differentiated them from the others.  All of these peoples had proven belligerent in the extreme.  In common with the rest of the fauna of Caprona the first law of nature as they seemed to understand it was to kill--kill--kill. And so it was that Bradley had no desire to follow up the little stream toward the pool near which were sure to be the caves of some savage tribe, but fortune played him an unkind trick, for the pool was much closer than he imagined, its southern end reaching fully a mile south of the point at which they crossed the stream, and so it was that after forcing their way through a tangle of jungle vegetation they came out upon the edge of the pool which they had wished to avoid.  Almost simultaneously there appeared south of them a party of naked men armed with clubs and hatchets.  Both parties halted as they caught sight of one another.  The men from the fort saw before them a hunting party evidently returning to its caves or village laden with meat.  They were large men with features closely resembling those of the African Negro though their skins were white.  Short hair grew upon a large portion of their limbs and bodies, which still retained a considerable trace of apish progenitors.  They were, however, a distinctly higher type than the Bo-lu, or club-men.  Bradley would have been glad to have averted a meeting; but as he desired to lead his party south around the end of the pool, and as it was hemmed in by the jungle on one side and the water on the other, there seemed no escape from an encounter.  On the chance that he might avoid a clash, Bradley stepped forward with upraised hand.  "We are friends, " he called in the tongue of Ahm, the Bolu, who had been held a prisoner at the fort; "permit us to pass in peace.  We will not harm you."  At this the hatchet-men set up a great jabbering with much laughter, loud and boisterous.  "No," shouted one, "you will not harm us, for we shall kill you.  Come!  We kill!  We kill!" And with hideous shouts they charged down upon the Europeans.  "Sinclair, you may fire," said Bradley quietly."  Pick off the leader.  Can't waste ammunition."  The Englishman raised his piece to his shoulder and took quick aim at the breast of the yelling savage leaping toward them. Directly behind the leader came another hatchet-man, and with the report of Sinclair's rifle both warriors lunged forward in the tall grass, pierced by the same bullet.  The effect upon the rest of the band was electrical.  As one man they came to a sudden halt, wheeled to the east and dashed into the jungle, where the men could hear them forcing their way in an effort to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the authors of this new and frightful noise that killed warriors at a great distance.  Both the savages were dead when Bradley approached to examine them, and as the Europeans gathered around, other eyes were bent upon them with greater curiosity than they displayed for the victim of Sinclair's bullet.  When the party again took up the march around the southern end of the pool the owner of the eyes followed them--large, round eyes, almost expressionless except for a certain cold cruelty which glinted malignly from under their pale gray irises.  All unconscious of the stalker, the men came, late in the afternoon, to a spot which seemed favorable as a campsite. A cold spring bubbled from the base of a rocky formation which overhung and partially encircled a small inclosure.  At Bradley's command, the men took up the duties assigned them--gathering wood, building a cook-fire and preparing the evening meal. It was while they were thus engaged that Brady's attention was attracted by the dismal flapping of huge wings.  He glanced up, expecting to see one of the great flying reptiles of a bygone age, his rifle ready in his hand.  Brady was a brave man.  He had groped his way up narrow tenement stairs and taken an armed maniac from a dark room without turning a hair; but now as he looked up, he went white and staggered back.  "Gawd!" he almost screamed.  "What is it?"  Attracted by Brady's cry the others seized their rifles as they followed his wide-eyed, frozen gaze, nor was there one of them that was not moved by some species of terror or awe.  Then Brady spoke again in an almost inaudible voice.  "Holy Mother protect us--it's a banshee!"  Bradley, always cool almost to indifference in the face of danger, felt a strange, creeping sensation run over his flesh, as slowly, not a hundred feet above them, the thing flapped itself across the sky, its huge, round eyes glaring down upon them. And until it disappeared over the tops of the trees of a near-by wood the five men stood as though paralyzed, their eyes never leaving the weird shape; nor never one of them appearing to recall that he grasped a loaded rifle in his hands.  With the passing of the thing, came the reaction.  Tippet sank to the ground and buried his face in his hands.  "Oh, Gord," he moaned. "Tyke me awy from this orful plice."  Brady, recovered from the first shock, swore loud and luridly.  He called upon all the saints to witness that he was unafraid and that anybody with half an eye could have seen that the creature was nothing more than "one av thim flyin' alligators" that they all were familiar with.  "Yes," said Sinclair with fine sarcasm, "we've saw so many of them with white shrouds on 'em."  "Shut up, you fool!" growled Brady.  "If you know so much, tell us what it was after bein' then."  Then he turned toward Bradley.  "What was it, sor, do you think?" he asked.  Bradley shook his head.  "I don't know," he said.  "It looked like a winged human being clothed in a flowing white robe.  Its face was more human than otherwise.  That is the way it looked to me; but what it really was I can't even guess, for such a creature is as far beyond my experience or knowledge as it is beyond yours. All that I am sure of is that whatever else it may have been, it was quite material--it was no ghost; rather just another of the strange forms of life which we have met here and with which we should be accustomed by this time."  Tippet looked up.  His face was still ashy.  "Yer cawn't tell me," he cried.  "Hi seen hit.  Blime, Hi seen hit.  Hit was ha dead man flyin' through the hair.  Didn't Hi see 'is heyes? Oh, Gord! Didn't Hi see 'em?"  "It didn't look like any beast or reptile to me," spoke up Sinclair. "It was lookin' right down at me when I looked up and I saw its face plain as I see yours.  It had big round eyes that looked all cold and dead, and its cheeks were sunken in deep, and I could see its yellow teeth behind thin, tight-drawn lips--like a man who had been dead a long while, sir," he added, turning toward Bradley.  "Yes!" James had not spoken since the apparition had passed over them, and now it was scarce speech which he uttered--rather a series of articulate gasps.  "Yes--dead--a--long--while.  It--means something. It--come--for some--one.  For one--of us.  One--of us is goin'-- to die.  I'm goin' to die!" he ended in a wail.  "Come!  Come!" snapped Bradley.  "Won't do.  Won't do at all. Get to work, all of you.  Waste of time.  Can't waste time."  His authoritative tones brought them all up standing, and presently each was occupied with his own duties; but each worked in silence and there was no singing and no bantering such as had marked the making of previous camps.  Not until they had eaten and to each had been issued the little ration of smoking tobacco allowed after each evening meal did any sign of a relaxation of taut nerves appear.  It was Brady who showed the first signs of returning good spirits.  He commenced humming "It's a Long Way to Tipperary" and presently to voice the words, but he was well into his third song before anyone joined him, and even then there seemed a dismal note in even the gayest of tunes.  A huge fire blazed in the opening of their rocky shelter that the prowling carnivora might be kept at bay; and always one man stood on guard, watchfully alert against a sudden rush by some maddened beast of the jungle.  Beyond the fire, yellow-green spots of flame appeared, moved restlessly about, disappeared and reappeared, accompanied by a hideous chorus of screams and growls and roars as the hungry meat-eaters hunting through the night were attracted by the light or the scent of possible prey.  But to such sights and sounds as these the five men had become callous.  They sang or talked as unconcernedly as they might have done in the bar-room of some publichouse at home.  Sinclair was standing guard.  The others were listening to Brady's description of traffic congestion at the Rush Street bridge during the rush hour at night.  The fire crackled cheerily. The owners of the yellow-green eyes raised their frightful chorus to the heavens.  Conditions seemed again to have returned to normal. And then, as though the hand of Death had reached out and touched them all, the five men tensed into sudden rigidity.  Above the nocturnal diapason of the teeming jungle sounded a dismal flapping of wings and over head, through the thick night, a shadowy form passed across the diffused light of the flaring camp-fire.  Sinclair raised his rifle and fired.  An eerie wail floated down from above and the apparition, whatever it might have been, was swallowed by the darkness.  For several seconds the listening men heard the sound of those dismally flapping wings lessening in the distance until they could no longer be heard.  Bradley was the first to speak.  "Shouldn't have fired, Sinclair," he said; "can't waste ammunition."  But there was no note of censure in his tone.  It was as though he understood the nervous reaction that had compelled the other's act.  "I couldn't help it, sir," said Sinclair.  "Lord, it would take an iron man to keep from shootin' at that awful thing.  Do you believe in ghosts, sir?"  "No," replied Bradley.  "No such things."  "I don't know about that," said Brady.  "There was a woman murdered over on the prairie near Brighton--her throat was cut from ear to ear, and--"  "Shut up," snapped Bradley.  "My grandaddy used to live down Coppington wy," said Tippet. "They were a hold ruined castle on a 'ill near by, hand at midnight they used to see pale blue lights through the windows an 'ear--"  "Will you close your hatch!" demanded Bradley.  "You fools will have yourselves scared to death in a minute.  Now go to sleep."  But there was little sleep in camp that night until utter exhaustion overtook the harassed men toward morning; nor was there any return of the weird creature that had set the nerves of each of them on edge.  The following forenoon the party reached the base of the barrier cliffs and for two days marched northward in an effort to discover a break in the frowning abutment that raised its rocky face almost perpendicularly above them, yet nowhere was there the slightest indication that the cliffs were scalable.  Disheartened, Bradley determined to turn back toward the fort, as he already had exceeded the time decided upon by Bowen Tyler and himself for the expedition.  The cliffs for many miles had been trending in a northeasterly direction, indicating to Bradley that they were approaching the northern extremity of the island. According to the best of his calculations they had made sufficient easting during the past two days to have brought them to a point almost directly north of Fort Dinosaur and as nothing could be gained by retracing their steps along the base of the cliffs he decided to strike due south through the unexplored country between them and the fort.  That night (September 9, 1916), they made camp a short distance from the cliffs beside one of the numerous cool springs that are to be found within Caspak, oftentimes close beside the still more numerous warm and hot springs which feed the many pools. After supper the men lay smoking and chatting among themselves. Tippet was on guard.  Fewer night prowlers threatened them, and the men were commenting upon the fact that the farther north they had traveled the smaller the number of all species of animals became, though it was still present in what would have seemed appalling plenitude in any other part of the world.  The diminution in reptilian life was the most noticeable change in the fauna of northern Caspak.  Here, however, were forms they had not met elsewhere, several of which were of gigantic proportions.  According to their custom all, with the exception of the man on guard, sought sleep early, nor, once disposed upon the ground for slumber, were they long in finding it.  It seemed to Bradley that he had scarcely closed his eyes when he was brought to his feet, wide awake, by a piercing scream which was punctuated by the sharp report of a rifle from the direction of the fire where Tippet stood guard.  As he ran toward the man, Bradley heard above him the same uncanny wail that had set every nerve on edge several nights before, and the dismal flapping of huge wings. He did not need to look up at the white-shrouded figure winging slowly away into the night to know that their grim visitor had returned.  The muscles of his arm, reacting to the sight and sound of the menacing form, carried his hand to the butt of his pistol; but after he had drawn the weapon, he immediately returned it to its holster with a shrug.  "What for?" he muttered.  "Can't waste ammunition."  Then he walked quickly to where Tippet lay sprawled upon his face. By this time James, Brady and Sinclair were at his heels, each with his rifle in readiness.  "Is he dead, sir?" whispered James as Bradley kneeled beside the prostrate form.  Bradley turned Tippet over on his back and pressed an ear close to the other's heart.  In a moment he raised his head. "Fainted," he announced.  "Get water.  Hurry!"  Then he loosened Tippet's shirt at the throat and when the water was brought, threw a cupful in the man's face.  Slowly Tippet regained consciousness and sat up.  At first he looked curiously into the faces of the men about him; then an expression of terror overspread his features.  He shot a startled glance up into the black void above and then burying his face in his arms began to sob like a child.  "What's wrong, man?" demanded Bradley.  "Buck up!  Can't play cry-baby.  Waste of energy.  What happened?"  "Wot 'appened, sir!" wailed Tippet.  "Oh, Gord, sir!   Hit came back. Hit came for me, sir.  Right hit did, sir; strite hat me, sir; hand with long w'ite 'ands it clawed for me.  Oh, Gord!  Hit almost caught me, sir.  Hi'm has good as dead; Hi'm a marked man; that's wot Hi ham.  Hit was a-goin' for to carry me horf, sir."  "Stuff and nonsense," snapped Bradley.  "Did you get a good look at it?"  Tippet said that he did--a much better look than he wanted. The thing had almost clutched him, and he had looked straight into its eyes--"dead heyes in a dead face," he had described them.  "Wot was it after bein', do you think?" inquired Brady.  "Hit was Death," moaned Tippet, shuddering, and again a pall of gloom fell upon the little party.  The following day Tippet walked as one in a trance.  He never spoke except in reply to a direct question, which more often than not had to be repeated before it could attract his attention. He insisted that he was already a dead man, for if the thing didn't come for him during the day he would never live through another night of agonized apprehension, waiting for the frightful end that he was positive was in store for him.  "I'll see to that," he said, and they all knew that Tippet meant to take his own life before darkness set in.  Bradley tried to reason with him, in his short, crisp way, but soon saw the futility of it; nor could he take the man's weapons from him without subjecting him to almost certain death from any of the numberless dangers that beset their way.  The entire party was moody and glum.  There was none of the bantering that had marked their intercourse before, even in the face of blighting hardships and hideous danger.  This was a new menace that threatened them, something that they couldn't explain; and so, naturally, it aroused within them superstitious fear which Tippet's attitude only tended to augment.  To add further to their gloom, their way led through a dense forest, where, on account of the underbrush, it was difficult to make even a mile an hour.  Constant watchfulness was required to avoid the many snakes of various degrees of repulsiveness and enormity that infested the wood; and the only ray of hope they had to cling to was that the forest would, like the majority of Caspakian forests, prove to be of no considerable extent.  Bradley was in the lead when he came suddenly upon a grotesque creature of Titanic proportions.  Crouching among the trees, which here commenced to thin out slightly, Bradley saw what appeared to be an enormous dragon devouring the carcass of a mammoth.  From frightful jaws to the tip of its long tail it was fully forty feet in length.  Its body was covered with plates of thick skin which bore a striking resemblance to armor-plate. The creature saw Bradley almost at the same instant that he saw it and reared up on its enormous hind legs until its head towered a full twenty-five feet above the ground.  From the cavernous jaws issued a hissing sound of a volume equal to the escaping steam from the safety-valves of half a dozen locomotives, and then the creature came for the man.  "Scatter!" shouted Bradley to those behind him; and all but Tippet heeded the warning.  The man stood as though dazed, and when Bradley saw the other's danger, he too stopped and wheeling about sent a bullet into the massive body forcing its way through the trees toward him.  The shot struck the creature in the belly where there was no protecting armor, eliciting a new note which rose in a shrill whistle and ended in a wail.  It was then that Tippet appeared to come out of his trance, for with a cry of terror he turned and fled to the left.  Bradley, seeing that he had as good an opportunity as the others to escape, now turned his attention to extricating himself; and as the woods seemed dense on the right, he ran in that direction, hoping that the close-set boles would prevent pursuit on the part of the great reptile. The dragon paid no further attention to him, however, for Tippet's sudden break for liberty had attracted its attention; and after Tippet it went, bowling over small trees, uprooting underbrush and leaving a wake behind it like that of a small tornado.  Bradley, the moment he had discovered the thing was pursuing Tippet, had followed it.  He was afraid to fire for fear of hitting the man, and so it was that he came upon them at the very moment that the monster lunged its great weight forward upon the doomed man.  The sharp, three-toed talons of the forelimbs seized poor Tippet, and Bradley saw the unfortunate fellow lifted high above the ground as the creature again reared up on its hind legs, immediately transferring Tippet's body to its gaping jaws, which closed with a sickening, crunching sound as Tippet's bones cracked beneath the great teeth.  Bradley half raised his rifle to fire again and then lowered it with a shake of his head.  Tippet was beyond succor--why waste a bullet that Caspak could never replace?  If he could now escape the further notice of the monster it would be a wiser act than to throw his life away in futile revenge.  He saw that the reptile was not looking in his direction, and so he slipped noiselessly behind the bole of a large tree and thence quietly faded away in the direction he believed the others to have taken.  At what he considered a safe distance he halted and looked back.  Half hidden by the intervening trees he still could see the huge head and the massive jaws from which protrude the limp legs of the dead man. Then, as though struck by the hammer of Thor, the creature collapsed and crumpled to the ground.  Bradley's single bullet, penetrating the body through the soft skin of the belly, had slain the Titan.  A few minutes later, Bradley found the others of the party. The four returned cautiously to the spot where the creature lay and after convincing themselves that it was quite dead, came close to it.  It was an arduous and gruesome job extricating Tippet's mangled remains from the powerful jaws, the men working for the most part silently.  "It was the work of the banshee all right," muttered Brady. "It warned poor Tippet, it did."  "Hit killed him, that's wot hit did, hand hit'll kill some more of us," said James, his lower lip trembling.  "If it was a ghost," interjected Sinclair, "and I don't say as it was; but if it was, why, it could take on any form it wanted to. It might have turned itself into this thing, which ain't no natural thing at all, just to get poor Tippet.  If it had of been a lion or something else humanlike it wouldn't look so strange; but this here thing ain't humanlike.  There ain't no such thing an' never was."  "Bullets don't kill ghosts," said Bradley, "so this couldn't have been a ghost.  Furthermore, there are no such things.  I've been trying to place this creature.  Just succeeded.  It's a tyrannosaurus. Saw picture of skeleton in magazine.  There's one in New York Natural History Museum.  Seems to me it said it was found in place called Hell Creek somewhere in western North America.  Supposed to have lived about six million years ago."  "Hell Creek's in Montana," said Sinclair.  "I used to punch cows in Wyoming, an' I've heard of Hell Creek.  Do you s'pose that there thing's six million years old?"  His tone was skeptical.  "No," replied Bradley; "But it would indicate that the island of Caprona has stood almost without change for more than six million years."  The conversation and Bradley's assurance that the creature was not of supernatural origin helped to raise a trifle the spirits of the men; and then came another diversion in the form of ravenous meat-eaters attracted to the spot by the uncanny sense of smell which had apprised them of the presence of flesh, killed and ready for the eating.  It was a constant battle while they dug a grave and consigned all that was mortal of John Tippet to his last, lonely resting-place. Nor would they leave then; but remained to fashion a rude head- stone from a crumbling out-cropping of sandstone and to gather a mass of the gorgeous flowers growing in such great profusion around them and heap the new-made grave with bright blooms. Upon the headstone Sinclair scratched in rude characters the words:   HERE LIES JOHN TIPPET      ENGLISHMAN KILLED BY TYRANNOSAURUS   10 SEPT. A.D. 1916        R.I.P.  and Bradley repeated a short prayer before they left their comrade forever.  For three days the party marched due south through forests and meadow-land and great park-like areas where countless herbivorous animals grazed--deer and antelope and bos and the little ecca, the smallest species of Caspakian horse, about the size of a rabbit. There were other horses too; but all were small, the largest being not above eight hands in height.  Preying continually upon the herbivora were the meat-eaters, large and small--wolves, hyaenadons, panthers, lions, tigers, and bear as well as several large and ferocious species of reptilian life.  On September twelfth the party scaled a line of sandstone cliffs which crossed their route toward the south; but they crossed them only after an encounter with the tribe that inhabited the numerous caves which pitted the face of the escarpment.  That night they camped upon a rocky plateau which was sparsely wooded with jarrah, and here once again they were visited by the weird, nocturnal apparition that had already filled them with a nameless terror.  As on the night of September ninth the first warning came from the sentinel standing guard over his sleeping companions. A terror-stricken cry punctuated by the crack of a rifle brought Bradley, Sinclair and Brady to their feet in time to see James, with clubbed rifle, battling with a white-robed figure that hovered on widespread wings on a level with the Englishman's head. As they ran, shouting, forward, it was obvious to them that the weird and terrible apparition was attempting to seize James; but when it saw the others coming to his rescue, it desisted, flapping rapidly upward and away, its long, ragged wings giving forth the peculiarly dismal notes which always characterized the sound of its flying.  Bradley fired at the vanishing menacer of their peace and safety; but whether he scored a hit or not, none could tell, though, following the shot, there was wafted back to them the same piercing wail that had on other occasions frozen their marrow.  Then they turned toward James, who lay face downward upon the ground, trembling as with ague.  For a time he could not even speak, but at last regained sufficient composure to tell them how the thing must have swooped silently upon him from above and behind as the first premonition of danger he had received was when the long, clawlike fingers had clutched him beneath either arm.  In the melee his rifle had been discharged and he had broken away at the same instant and turned to defend himself with the butt.  The rest they had seen.  From that instant James was an absolutely broken man. He maintained with shaking lips that his doom was sealed, that the thing had marked him for its own, and that he was as good as dead, nor could any amount of argument or raillery convince him to the contrary.  He had seen Tippet marked and claimed and now he had been marked.  Nor were his constant reiterations of this belief without effect upon the rest of the party.  Even Bradley felt depressed, though for the sake of the others he managed to hide it beneath a show of confidence he was far from feeling.  And on the following day William James was killed by a saber-tooth tiger--September 13, 1916.  Beneath a jarrah tree on the stony plateau on the northern edge of the Sto-lu country in the land that Time forgot, he lies in a lonely grave marked by a rough headstone.  Southward from his grave marched three grim and silent men. To the best of Bradley's reckoning they were some twenty-five miles north of Fort Dinosaur, and that they might reach the fort on the following day, they plodded on until darkness overtook them. With comparative safety fifteen miles away, they made camp at last; but there was no singing now and no joking.  In the bottom of his heart each prayed that they might come safely through just this night, for they knew that during the morrow they would make the final stretch, yet the nerves of each were taut with strained anticipation of what gruesome thing might flap down upon them from the black sky, marking another for its own.  Who would be the next?  As was their custom, they took turns at guard, each man doing two hours and then arousing the next.  Brady had gone on from eight to ten, followed by Sinclair from ten to twelve, then Bradley had been awakened.  Brady would stand the last guard from two to four, as they had determined to start the moment that it became light enough to insure comparative safety upon the trail.  The snapping of a twig aroused Brady out of a dead sleep, and as he opened his eyes, he saw that it was broad daylight and that at twenty paces from him stood a huge lion.  As the man sprang to his feet, his rifle ready in his hand, Sinclair awoke and took in the scene in a single swift glance.  The fire was out and Bradley was nowhere in sight.  For a long moment the lion and the men eyed one another.  The latter had no mind to fire if the beast minded its own affairs--they were only too glad to let it go its way if it would; but the lion was of a different mind.  Suddenly the long tail snapped stiffly erect, and as though it had been attached to two trigger fingers the two rifles spoke in unison, for both men knew this signal only too well--the immediate forerunner of a deadly charge.  As the brute's head had been raised, his spine had not been visible; and so they did what they had learned by long experience was best to do.  Each covered a front leg, and as the tail snapped aloft, fired.  With a hideous roar the mighty flesh-eater lurched forward to the ground with both front legs broken.  It was an easy accomplishment in the instant before the beast charged--after, it would have been well-nigh an impossible feat.  Brady stepped close in and finished him with a shot in the base of the brain lest his terrific roarings should attract his mate or others of their kind.  Then the two men turned and looked at one another.  "Where is Lieutenant Bradley?" asked Sinclair.  They walked to the fire. Only a few smoking embers remained.  A few feet away lay Bradley's rifle.  There was no evidence of a struggle.  The two men circled about the camp twice and on the last lap Brady stooped and picked up an object which had lain about ten yards beyond the fire--it was Bradley's cap.  Again the two looked questioningly at one another, and then, simultaneously, both pairs of eyes swung upward and searched the sky.  A moment later Brady was examining the ground about the spot where Bradley's cap had lain.  It was one of those little barren, sandy stretches that they had found only upon this stony plateau.  Brady's own footsteps showed as plainly as black ink upon white paper; but his was the only foot that had marred the smooth, windswept surface--there was no sign that Bradley had crossed the spot upon the surface of the ground, and yet his cap lay well toward the center of it.  Breakfastless and with shaken nerves the two survivors plunged madly into the long day's march.  Both were strong, courageous, resourceful men; but each had reached the limit of human nerve endurance and each felt that he would rather die than spend another night in the hideous open of that frightful land. Vivid in the mind of each was a picture of Bradley's end, for though neither had witnessed the tragedy, both could imagine almost precisely what had occurred.  They did not discuss it--they did not even mention it--yet all day long the thing was uppermost in the mind of each and mingled with it a similar picture with himself as victim should they fail to make Fort Dinosaur before dark.  And so they plunged forward at reckless speed, their clothes, their hands, their faces torn by the retarding underbrush that reached forth to hinder them.  Again and again they fell; but be it to their credit that the one always waited and helped the other and that into the mind of neither entered the thought or the temptation to desert his companion--they would reach the fort together if both survived, or neither would reach it.  They encountered the usual number of savage beasts and reptiles; but they met them with a courageous recklessness born of desperation, and by virtue of the very madness of the chances they took, they came through unscathed and with the minimum of delay.  Shortly after noon they reached the end of the plateau. Before them was a drop of two hundred feet to the valley beneath. To the left, in the distance, they could see the waters of the great inland sea that covers a considerable portion of the area of the crater island of Caprona and at a little lesser distance to the south of the cliffs they saw a thin spiral of smoke arising above the tree-tops.  The landscape was familiar--each recognized it immediately and knew that that smoky column marked the spot where Dinosaur had stood.  Was the fort still there, or did the smoke arise from the smoldering embers of the building they had helped to fashion for the housing of their party?  Who could say!  Thirty precious minutes that seemed as many hours to the impatient men were consumed in locating a precarious way from the summit to the base of the cliffs that bounded the plateau upon the south, and then once again they struck off upon level ground toward their goal.  The closer they approached the fort the greater became their apprehension that all would not be well. They pictured the barracks deserted or the small company massacred and the buildings in ashes.  It was almost in a frenzy of fear that they broke through the final fringe of jungle and stood at last upon the verge of the open meadow a half-mile from Fort Dinosaur.  "Lord!" ejaculated Sinclair.  "They are still there!"  And he fell to his knees, sobbing.  Brady trembled like a leaf as he crossed himself and gave silent thanks, for there before them stood the sturdy ramparts of Dinosaur and from inside the inclosure rose a thin spiral of smoke that marked the location of the cook-house.  All was well, then, and their comrades were preparing the evening meal!  Across the clearing they raced as though they had not already covered in a single day a trackless, primeval country that might easily have required two days by fresh and untired men. Within hailing distance they set up such a loud shouting that presently heads appeared above the top of the parapet and soon answering shouts were rising from within Fort Dinosaur.  A moment later three men issued from the inclosure and came forward to meet the survivors and listen to the hurried story of the eleven eventful days since they had set out upon their expedition to the barrier cliffs.  They heard of the deaths of Tippet and James and of the disappearance of Lieutenant Bradley, and a new terror settled upon Dinosaur.  Olson, the Irish engineer, with Whitely and Wilson constituted the remnants of Dinosaur's defenders, and to Brady and Sinclair they narrated the salient events that had transpired since Bradley and his party had marched away on September 4th.  They told them of the infamous act of Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts and his German crew who had stolen the U-33, breaking their parole, and steaming away toward the subterranean opening through the barrier cliffs that carried the waters of the inland sea into the open Pacific beyond; and of the cowardly shelling of the fort.  They told of the disappearance of Miss La Rue in the night of September 11th, and of the departure of Bowen Tyler in search of her, accompanied only by his Airedale, Nobs.  Thus of the original party of eleven Allies and nine Germans that had constituted the company of the U-33 when she left English waters after her capture by the crew of the English tug there were but five now to be accounted for at Fort Dinosaur.  Benson, Tippet, James, and one of the Germans were known to be dead.  It was assumed that Bradley, Tyler and the girl had already succumbed to some of the savage denizens of Caspak, while the fate of the Germans was equally unknown, though it might readily be believed that they had made good their escape.  They had had ample time to provision the ship and the refining of the crude oil they had discovered north of the fort could have insured them an ample supply to carry them back to Germany.    Chapter 2   When bradley went on guard at midnight, September 14th, his thoughts were largely occupied with rejoicing that the night was almost spent without serious mishap and that the morrow would doubtless see them all safely returned to Fort Dinosaur. The hopefulness of his mood was tinged with sorrow by recollection of the two members of his party who lay back there in the savage wilderness and for whom there would never again be a homecoming.  No premonition of impending ill cast gloom over his anticipations for the coming day, for Bradley was a man who, while taking every precaution against possible danger, permitted no gloomy forebodings to weigh down his spirit.  When danger threatened, he was prepared; but he was not forever courting disaster, and so it was that when about one o'clock in the morning of the fifteenth, he heard the dismal flapping of giant wings overhead, he was neither surprised nor frightened but idly prepared for an attack he had known might reasonably be expected.  The sound seemed to come from the south, and presently, low above the trees in that direction, the man made out a dim, shadowy form circling slowly about.  Bradley was a brave man, yet so keen was the feeling of revulsion engendered by the sight and sound of that grim, uncanny shape that he distinctly felt the gooseflesh rise over the surface of his body, and it was with difficulty that he refrained from following an instinctive urge to fire upon the nocturnal intruder.  Better, far better would it have been had he given in to the insistent demand of his subconscious mentor; but his almost fanatical obsession to save ammunition proved now his undoing, for while his attention was riveted upon the thing circling before him and while his ears were filled with the beating of its wings, there swooped silently out of the black night behind him another weird and ghostly shape.  With its huge wings partly closed for the dive and its white robe fluttering in its wake, the apparition swooped down upon the Englishman.  So great was the force of the impact when the thing struck Bradley between the shoulders that the man was half stunned. His rifle flew from his grasp; he felt clawlike talons of great strength seize him beneath his arms and sweep him off his feet; and then the thing rose swiftly with him, so swiftly that his cap was blown from his head by the rush of air as he was borne rapidly upward into the inky sky and the cry of warning to his companions was forced back into his lungs.  The creature wheeled immediately toward the east and was at once joined by its fellow, who circled them once and then fell in behind them.  Bradley now realized the strategy that the pair had used to capture him and at once concluded that he was in the power of reasoning beings closely related to the human race if not actually of it.  Past experience suggested that the great wings were a part of some ingenious mechanical device, for the limitations of the human mind, which is always loath to accept aught beyond its own little experience, would not permit him to entertain the idea that the creatures might be naturally winged and at the same time of human origin.  From his position Bradley could not see the wings of his captor, nor in the darkness had he been able to examine those of the second creature closely when it circled before him.  He listened for the puff of a motor or some other telltale sound that would prove the correctness of his theory. However, he was rewarded with nothing more than the constant flap-flap.  Presently, far below and ahead, he saw the waters of the inland sea, and a moment later he was borne over them.  Then his captor did that which proved beyond doubt to Bradley that he was in the hands of human beings who had devised an almost perfect scheme of duplicating, mechanically, the wings of a bird--the thing spoke to its companion and in a language that Bradley partially understood, since he recognized words that he had learned from the savage races of Caspak.  From this he judged that they were human, and being human, he knew that they could have no natural wings--for who had ever seen a human being so adorned! Therefore their wings must be mechanical.  Thus Bradley reasoned-- thus most of us reason; not by what might be possible; but by what has fallen within the range of our experience.  What he heard them say was to the effect that having covered half the distance the burden would now be transferred from one to the other.  Bradley wondered how the exchange was to be accomplished.  He knew that those giant wings would not permit the creatures to approach one another closely enough to effect the transfer in this manner; but he was soon to discover that they had other means of doing it.  He felt the thing that carried him rise to a greater altitude, and below he glimpsed momentarily the second white-robed figure; then the creature above sounded a low call, it was answered from below, and instantly Bradley felt the clutching talons release him; gasping for breath, he hurtled downward through space.  For a terrifying instant, pregnant with horror, Bradley fell; then something swooped for him from behind, another pair of talons clutched him beneath the arms, his downward rush was checked, within another hundred feet, and close to the surface of the sea he was again borne upward.  As a hawk dives for a songbird on the wing, so this great, human bird dived for Bradley. It was a harrowing experience, but soon over, and once again the captive was being carried swiftly toward the east and what fate he could not even guess.  It was immediately following his transfer in mid-air that Bradley made out the shadowy form of a large island far ahead, and not long after, he realized that this must be the intended destination of his captors.  Nor was he mistaken.  Three quarters of an hour from the time of his seizure his captors dropped gently to earth in the strangest city that human eye had ever rested upon.  Just a brief glimpse of his immediate surroundings vouchsafed Bradley before he was whisked into the interior of one of the buildings; but in that momentary glance he saw strange piles of stone and wood and mud fashioned into buildings of all conceivable sizes and shapes, sometimes piled high on top of one another, sometimes standing alone in an open court-way, but usually crowded and jammed together, so that there were no streets or alleys between them other than a few which ended almost as soon as they began.  The principal doorways appeared to be in the roofs, and it was through one of these that Bradley was inducted into the dark interior of a low-ceiled room.  Here he was pushed roughly into a corner where he tripped over a thick mat, and there his captors left him.  He heard them moving about in the darkness for a moment, and several times he saw their large luminous eyes glowing in the dark.  Finally, these disappeared and silence reigned, broken only by the breathing of the creature which indicated to the Englishman that they were sleeping somewhere in the same apartment.  It was now evident that the mat upon the floor was intended for sleeping purposes and that the rough shove that had sent him to it had been a rude invitation to repose.  After taking stock of himself and finding that he still had his pistol and ammunition, some matches, a little tobacco, a canteen full of water and a razor, Bradley made himself comfortable upon the mat and was soon asleep, knowing that an attempted escape in the darkness without knowledge of his surroundings would be predoomed to failure.  When he awoke, it was broad daylight, and the sight that met his eyes made him rub them again and again to assure himself that they were really open and that he was not dreaming.  A broad shaft of morning light poured through the open doorway in the ceiling of the room which was about thirty feet square, or roughly square, being irregular in shape, one side curving outward, another being indented by what might have been the corner of another building jutting into it, another alcoved by three sides of an octagon, while the fourth was serpentine in contour.  Two windows let in more daylight, while two doors evidently gave ingress to other rooms.  The walls were partially ceiled with thin strips of wood, nicely fitted and finished, partially plastered and the rest covered with a fine, woven cloth. Figures of reptiles and beasts were painted without regard to any uniform scheme here and there upon the walls.  A striking feature of the decorations consisted of several engaged columns set into the walls at no regular intervals, the capitals of each supporting a human skull the cranium of which touched the ceiling, as though the latter was supported by these grim reminders either of departed relatives or of some hideous tribal rite--Bradley could not but wonder which.  Yet it was none of these things that filled him with greatest wonder--no, it was the figures of the two creatures that had captured him and brought him hither.  At one end of the room a stout pole about two inches in diameter ran horizontally from wall to wall some six or seven feet from the floor, its ends securely set in two of the columns.  Hanging by their knees from this perch, their heads downward and their bodies wrapped in their huge wings, slept the creatures of the night before--like two great, horrid bats they hung, asleep.  As Bradley gazed upon them in wide-eyed astonishment, he saw plainly that all his intelligence, all his acquired knowledge through years of observation and experience were set at naught by the simple evidence of the fact that stood out glaringly before his eyes--the creatures' wings were not mechanical devices but as natural appendages, growing from their shoulderblades, as were their arms and legs.  He saw, too, that except for their wings the pair bore a strong resemblance to human beings, though fashioned in a most grotesque mold.  As he sat gazing at them, one of the two awoke, separated his wings to release his arms that had been folded across his breast, placed his hands upon the floor, dropped his feet and stood erect. For a moment he stretched his great wings slowly, solemnly blinking his large round eyes.  Then his gaze fell upon Bradley. The thin lips drew back tightly against yellow teeth in a grimace that was nothing but hideous.  It could not have been termed a smile, and what emotion it registered the Englishman was at a loss to guess.  No expression whatever altered the steady gaze of those large, round eyes; there was no color upon the pasty, sunken cheeks.  A death's head grimaced as though a man long dead raised his parchment-covered skull from an old grave.  The creature stood about the height of an average man but appeared much taller from the fact that the joints of his long wings rose fully a foot above his hairless head.  The bare arms were long and sinewy, ending in strong, bony hands with clawlike fingers--almost talonlike in their suggestiveness.  The white robe was separated in front, revealing skinny legs and the further fact that the thing wore but the single garment, which was of fine, woven cloth.  From crown to sole the portions of the body exposed were entirely hairless, and as he noted this, Bradley also noted for the first time the cause of much of the seeming expressionlessness of the creature's countenance--it had neither eye-brows or lashes.  The ears were small and rested flat against the skull, which was noticeably round, though the face was quite flat.  The creature had small feet, beautifully arched and plump, but so out of keeping with every other physical attribute it possessed as to appear ridiculous.  After eyeing Bradley for a moment the thing approached him. "Where from?" it asked.  "England," replied Bradley, as briefly.  "Where is England and what?" pursued the questioner.  "It is a country far from here," answered the Englishman.  "Are your people cor-sva-jo or cos-ata-lu?"  "I do not understand you," said Bradley; "and now suppose you answer a few questions.  Who are you?  What country is this? Why did you bring me here?"  Again the sepulchral grimace.  "We are Wieroos--Luata is our father. Caspak is ours.  This, our country, is called Oo-oh.  We brought you here for (literally) Him Who Speaks for Luata to gaze upon and question.  He would know from whence you came and why; but principally if you be cos-ata-lu."  "And if I am not cos--whatever you call the bloomin' beast-- what of it?"  The Wieroo raised his wings in a very human shrug and waved his bony claws toward the human skulls supporting the ceiling. His gesture was eloquent; but he embellished it by remarking, "And possibly if you are."  "I'm hungry," snapped Bradley.  The Wieroo motioned him to one of the doors which he threw open, permitting Bradley to pass out onto another roof on a level lower than that upon which they had landed earlier in the morning. By daylight the city appeared even more remarkable than in the moonlight, though less weird and unreal.  The houses of all shapes and sizes were piled about as a child might pile blocks of various forms and colors.  He saw now that there were what might be called streets or alleys, but they ran in baffling turns and twists, nor ever reached a destination, always ending in a dead wall where some Wieroo had built a house across them.  Upon each house was a slender column supporting a human skull. Sometimes the columns were at one corner of the roof, sometimes at another, or again they rose from the center or near the center, and the columns were of varying heights, from that of a man to those which rose twenty feet above their roofs. The skulls were, as a rule, painted--blue or white, or in combinations of both colors.  The most effective were painted blue with the teeth white and the eye-sockets rimmed with white.  There were other skulls--thousands of them--tens, hundreds of thousands.  They rimmed the eaves of every house, they were set in the plaster of the outer walls and at no great distance from where Bradley stood rose a round tower built entirely of human skulls.  And the city extended in every direction as far as the Englishman could see.  All about him Wieroos were moving across the roofs or winging through the air.  The sad sound of their flapping wings rose and fell like a solemn dirge.  Most of them were appareled all in white, like his captors; but others had markings of red or blue or yellow slashed across the front of their robes.  His guide pointed toward a doorway in an alley below them. "Go there and eat," he commanded, "and then come back. You cannot escape.  If any question you, say that you belong to Fosh-bal-soj.  There is the way."  And this time he pointed to the top of a ladder which protruded above the eaves of the roof near-by.  Then he turned and reentered the house.  Bradley looked about him.  No, he could not escape--that seemed evident.  The city appeared interminable, and beyond the city, if not a savage wilderness filled with wild beasts, there was the broad inland sea infested with horrid monsters.  No wonder his captor felt safe in turning him loose in Oo-oh--he wondered if that was the name of the country or the city and if there were other cities like this upon the island.  Slowly he descended the ladder to the seemingly deserted alley which was paved with what appeared to be large, round cobblestones. He looked again at the smooth, worn pavement, and a rueful grin crossed his features--the alley was paved with skulls.  "The City of Human Skulls," mused Bradley.  "They must have been collectin' 'em since Adam," he thought, and then he crossed and entered the building through the doorway that had been pointed out to him.  Inside he found a large room in which were many Wieroos seated before pedestals the tops of which were hollowed out so that they resembled the ordinary bird drinking- and bathing-fonts so commonly seen on suburban lawns.  A seat protruded from each of the four sides of the pedestals--just a flat board with a support running from its outer end diagonally to the base of the pedestal.  As Bradley entered, some of the Wieroos espied him, and a dismal wail arose.  Whether it was a greeting or a threat, Bradley did not know.  Suddenly from a dark alcove another Wieroo rushed out toward him.  "Who are you?" he cried.  "What do you want?"  "Fosh-bal-soj sent me here to eat," replied Bradley.  "Do you belong to Fosh-bal-soj?" asked the other.  "That appears to be what he thinks," answered the Englishman.  "Are you cos-ata-lu?" demanded the Wieroo.  "Give me something to eat or I'll be all of that," replied Bradley.  The Wieroo looked puzzled.  "Sit here, jaal-lu," he snapped, and Bradley sat down unconscious of the fact that he had been insulted by being called a hyena-man, an appellation of contempt in Caspak.  The Wieroo had seated him at a pedestal by himself, and as he sat waiting for what was next to transpire, he looked about him at the Wieroo in his immediate vicinity.  He saw that in each font was a quantity of food, and that each Wieroo was armed with a wooden skewer, sharpened at one end; with which they carried solid portions of food to their mouths.  At the other end of the skewer was fastened a small clam-shell.  This was used to scoop up the smaller and softer portions of the repast into which all four of the occupants of each table dipped impartially.  The Wieroo leaned far over their food, scooping it up rapidly and with much noise, and so great was their haste that a part of each mouthful always fell back into the common dish; and when they choked, by reason of the rapidity with which they attempted to bolt their food, they often lost it all.  Bradley was glad that he had a pedestal all to himself.  Soon the keeper of the place returned with a wooden bowl filled with food.  This he dumped into Bradley's "trough," as he already thought of it.  The Englishman was glad that he could not see into the dark alcove or know what were all the ingredients that constituted the mess before him, for he was very hungry.  After the first mouthful he cared even less to investigate the antecedents of the dish, for he found it peculiarly palatable. It seemed to consist of a combination of meat, fruits, vegetables, small fish and other undistinguishable articles of food all seasoned to produce a gastronomic effect that was at once baffling and delicious.  When he had finished, his trough was empty, and then he commenced to wonder who was to settle for his meal.  As he waited for the proprietor to return, he fell to examining the dish from which he had eaten and the pedestal upon which it rested.  The font was of stone worn smooth by long-continued use, the four outer edges hollowed and polished by the contact of the countless Wieroo bodies that had leaned against them for how long a period of time Bradley could not even guess.  Everything about the place carried the impression of hoary age.  The carved pedestals were black with use, the wooden seats were worn hollow, the floor of stone slabs was polished by the contact of possibly millions of naked feet and worn away in the aisles between the pedestals so that the latter rested upon little mounds of stone several inches above the general level of the floor.  Finally, seeing that no one came to collect, Bradley arose and started for the doorway.  He had covered half the distance when he heard the voice of mine host calling to him:  "Come back, jaal-lu," screamed the Wieroo; and Bradley did as he was bid. As he approached the creature which stood now behind a large, flat-topped pedestal beside the alcove, he saw lying upon the smooth surface something that almost elicited a gasp of astonishment from him--a simple, common thing it was, or would have been almost anywhere in the world but Caspak--a square bit of paper!  And on it, in a fine hand, written compactly, were many strange hieroglyphics!  These remarkable creatures, then, had a written as well as a spoken language and besides the art of weaving cloth possessed that of paper-making.  Could it be that such grotesque beings represented the high culture of the human race within the boundaries of Caspak?  Had natural selection produced during the countless ages of Caspakian life a winged monstrosity that represented the earthly pinnacle of man's evolution?  Bradley had noted something of the obvious indications of a gradual evolution from ape to spearman as exemplified by the several overlapping races of Alalus, club-men and hatchet-men that formed the connecting links between the two extremes with which he, had come in contact.  He had heard of the Krolus and the Galus--reputed to be still higher in the plane of evolution-- and now he had indisputable evidence of a race possessing refinements of civilization eons in advance of the spear-men. The conjectures awakened by even a momentary consideration of the possibilities involved became at once as wildly bizarre as the insane imagings of a drug addict.  As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the Wieroo held out a pen of bone fixed to a wooden holder and at the same time made a sign that Bradley was to write upon the paper.  It was difficult to judge from the expressionless features of the Wieroo what was passing in the creature's mind, but Bradley could not but feel that the thing cast a supercilious glance upon him as much as to say, "Of course you do not know how to write, you poor, low creature; but you can make your mark."  Bradley seized the pen and in a clear, bold hand wrote:  "John Bradley, England."  The Wieroo showed evidences of consternation as it seized the piece of paper and examined the writing with every mark of incredulity and surprise.  Of course it could make nothing of the strange characters; but it evidently accepted them as proof that Bradley possessed knowledge of a written language of his own, for following the Englishman's entry it made a few characters of its own.  "You will come here again just before Lua hides his face behind the great cliff," announced the creature, "unless before that you are summoned by Him Who Speaks for Luata, in which case you will not have to eat any more."  "Reassuring cuss," thought Bradley as he turned and left the building.  Outside were several Wieroos that had been eating at the pedestals within.  They immediately surrounded him, asking all sorts of questions, plucking at his garments, his ammunition-belt and his pistol.  Their demeanor was entirely different from what it had been within the eating-place and Bradley was to learn that a house of food was sanctuary for him, since the stern laws of the Wieroos forbade altercations within such walls.  Now they were rough and threatening, as with wings half spread they hovered about him in menacing attitudes, barring his way to the ladder leading to the roof from whence he had descended; but the Englishman was not one to brook interference for long.  He attempted at first to push his way past them, and then when one seized his arm and jerked him roughly back, Bradley swung upon the creature and with a heavy blow to the jaw felled it.  Instantly pandemonium reigned.  Loud wails arose, great wings opened and closed with a loud, beating noise and many clawlike hands reached forth to clutch him.  Bradley struck to right and left.  He dared not use his pistol for fear that once they discovered its power he would be overcome by weight of numbers and relieved of possession of what he considered his trump card, to be reserved until the last moment that it might be used to aid in his escape, for already the Englishman was planning, though almost hopelessly, such an attempt.  A few blows convinced Bradley that the Wieroos were arrant cowards and that they bore no weapons, for after two or three had fallen beneath his fists the others formed a circle about him, but at a safe distance and contented themselves with threatening and blustering, while those whom he had felled lay upon the pavement without trying to arise, the while they moaned and wailed in lugubrious chorus.  Again Bradley strode toward the ladder, and this time the circle parted before him; but no sooner had he ascended a few rungs than he was seized by one foot and an effort made to drag him down. With a quick backward glance the Englishman, clinging firmly to the ladder with both hands, drew up his free foot and with all the strength of a powerful leg, planted a heavy shoe squarely in the flat face of the Wieroo that held him.  Shrieking horribly, the creature clapped both hands to its face and sank to the ground while Bradley clambered quickly the remaining distance to the roof, though no sooner did he reach the top of the ladder than a great flapping of wings beneath him warned him that the Wieroos were rising after him.  A moment later they swarmed about his head as he ran for the apartment in which he had spent the early hours of the morning after his arrival.  It was but a short distance from the top of the ladder to the doorway, and Bradley had almost reached his goal when the door flew open and Fosh-bal-soj stepped out.  Immediately the pursuing Wieroos demanded punishment of the jaal-lu who had so grievously maltreated them.  Fosh-bal-soj listened to their complaints and then with a sudden sweep of his right hand seized Bradley by the scruff of the neck and hurled him sprawling through the doorway upon the floor of the chamber.  So sudden was the assault and so surprising the strength of the Wieroo that the Englishman was taken completely off his guard. When he arose, the door was closed, and Fosh-bal-soj was standing over him, his hideous face contorted into an expression of rage and hatred.  "Hyena, snake, lizard!" he screamed.  "You would dare lay your low, vile, profaning hands upon even the lowliest of the Wieroos-- the sacred chosen of Luata!"  Bradley was mad, and so he spoke in a very low, calm voice while a half-smile played across his lips but his cold, gray eyes were unsmiling.  "What you did to me just now," he said, "--I am going to kill you for that," and even as he spoke, he launched himself at the throat of Fosh-bal-soj.  The other Wieroo that had been asleep when Bradley left the chamber had departed, and the two were alone. Fosh-bal-soj displayed little of the cowardice of those that had attacked Bradley in the alleyway, but that may have been because he had so slight opportunity, for Bradley had him by the throat before he could utter a cry and with his right hand struck him heavily and repeatedly upon his face and over his heart--ugly, smashing, short-arm jabs of the sort that take the fight out of a man in quick time.  But Fosh-bal-soj was of no mind to die passively.  He clawed and struck at Bradley while with his great wings he attempted to shield himself from the merciless rain of blows, at the same time searching for a hold upon his antagonist's throat.  Presently he succeeded in tripping the Englishman, and together the two fell heavily to the floor, Bradley underneath, and at the same instant the Wieroo fastened his long talons about the other's windpipe.  Fosh-bal-soj was possessed of enormous strength and he was fighting for his life.  The Englishman soon realized that the battle was going against him.  Already his lungs were pounding painfully for air as he reached for his pistol.  It was with difficulty that he drew it from its holster, and even then, with death staring him in the face, he thought of his precious ammunition. "Can't waste it," he thought; and slipping his fingers to the barrel he raised the weapon and struck Fosh-bal-soj a terrific blow between the eyes.  Instantly the clawlike fingers released their hold, and the creature sank limply to the floor beside Bradley, who lay for several minutes gasping painfully in an effort to regain his breath.  When he was able, he rose, and leaned close over the Wieroo, lying silent and motionless, his wings dropping limply and his great, round eyes staring blankly toward the ceiling.  A brief examination convinced Bradley that the thing was dead, and with the conviction came an overwhelming sense of the dangers which must now confront him; but how was he to escape?  His first thought was to find some means for concealing the evidence of his deed and then to make a bold effort to escape. Stepping to the second door he pushed it gently open and peered in upon what seemed to be a store room.  In it was a litter of cloth such as the Wieroos' robes were fashioned from, a number of chests painted blue and white, with white hieroglyphics painted in bold strokes upon the blue and blue hieroglyphics upon the white.  In one corner was a pile of human skulls reaching almost to the ceiling and in another a stack of dried Wieroo wings. The chamber was as irregularly shaped as the other and had but a single window and a second door at the further end, but was without the exit through the roof and, most important of all, there was no creature of any sort in it.  As quickly as possible Bradley dragged the dead Wieroo through the doorway and closed the door; then he looked about for a place to conceal the corpse.  One of the chests was large enough to hold the body if the knees were bent well up, and with this idea in view Bradley approached the chest to open it.  The lid was made in two pieces, each being hinged at an opposite end of the chest and joining nicely where they met in the center of the chest, making a snug, well-fitting joint.  There was no lock. Bradley raised one half the cover and looked in.  With a smothered "By Jove!" he bent closer to examine the contents--the chest was about half filled with an assortment of golden trinkets. There were what appeared to be bracelets, anklets and brooches of virgin gold.  Realizing that there was no room in the chest for the body of the Wieroo, Bradley turned to seek another means of concealing the evidence of his crime.  There was a space between the chests and the wall, and into this he forced the corpse, piling the discarded robes upon it until it was entirely hidden from sight; but now how was he to make good his escape in the bright glare of that early Spring day?  He walked to the door at the far end of the apartment and cautiously opened it an inch.  Before him and about two feet away was the blank wall of another building.  Bradley opened the door a little farther and looked in both directions.  There was no one in sight to the left over a considerable expanse of roof-top, and to the right another building shut off his line of vision at about twenty feet.  Slipping out, he turned to the right and in a few steps found a narrow passageway between two buildings. Turning into this he passed about half its length when he saw a Wieroo appear at the opposite end and halt.  The creature was not looking down the passageway; but at any moment it might turn its eyes toward him, when he would be immediately discovered.  To Bradley's left was a triangular niche in the wall of one of the houses and into this he dodged, thus concealing himself from the sight of the Wieroo.  Beside him was a door painted a vivid yellow and constructed after the same fashion as the other Wieroo doors he had seen, being made up of countless narrow strips of wood from four to six inches in length laid on in patches of about the same width, the strips in adjacent patches never running in the same direction.  The result bore some resemblance to a crazy patchwork quilt, which was heightened when, as in one of the doors he had seen, contiguous patches were painted different colors.  The strips appeared to have been bound together and to the underlying framework of the door with gut or fiber and also glued, after which a thick coating of paint had been applied.  One edge of the door was formed of a straight, round pole about two inches in diameter that protruded at top and bottom, the projections setting in round holes in both lintel and sill forming the axis upon which the door swung.  An eccentric disk upon the inside face of the door engaged a slot in the frame when it was desired to secure the door against intruders.  As Bradley stood flattened against the wall waiting for the Wieroo to move on, he heard the creature's wings brushing against the sides of the buildings as it made its way down the narrow passage in his direction.  As the yellow door offered the only means of escape without detection, the Englishman decided to risk whatever might lie beyond it, and so, boldly pushing it in, he crossed the threshold and entered a small apartment.  As he did so, he heard a muffled ejaculation of surprise, and turning his eyes in the direction from whence the sound had come, he beheld a wide-eyed girl standing flattened against the opposite wall, an expression of incredulity upon her face.  At a glance he saw that she was of no race of humans that he had come in contact with since his arrival upon Caprona--there was no trace about her form or features of any relationship to those low orders of men, nor was she appareled as they--or, rather, she did not entirely lack apparel as did most of them.  A soft hide fell from her left shoulder to just below her left hip on one side and almost to her right knee on the other, a loose girdle was about her waist, and golden ornaments such as he had seen in the blue-and-white chest encircled her arms and legs, while a golden fillet with a triangular diadem bound her heavy hair above her brows.  Her skin was white as from long confinement within doors; but it was clear and fine.  Her figure, but partially concealed by the soft deerskin, was all curves of symmetry and youthful grace, while her features might easily have been the envy of the most feted of Continental beauties.  If the girl was surprised by the sudden appearance of Bradley, the latter was absolutely astounded to discover so wondrous a creature among the hideous inhabitants of the City of Human Skulls.  For a moment the two looked at one another in unconcealed consternation, and then Bradley spoke, using to the best of his poor ability, the common tongue of Caspak.  "Who are you," he asked, "and from where do you come?  Do not tell me that you are a Wieroo."  "No," she replied, "I am no Wieroo."  And she shuddered slightly as she pronounced the word.  "I am a Galu; but who and what are you? I am sure that you are no Galu, from your garments; but you are like the Galus in other respects.  I know that you are not of this frightful city, for I have been here for almost ten moons, and never have I seen a male Galu brought hither before, nor are there such as you and I, other than prisoners in the land of Oo-oh, and these are all females.  Are you a prisoner, then?"  He told her briefly who and what he was, though he doubted if she understood, and from her he learned that she had been a prisoner there for many months; but for what purpose he did not then learn, as in the midst of their conversation the yellow door swung open and a Wieroo with a robe slashed with yellow entered.  At sight of Bradley the creature became furious.  "Whence came this reptile?" it demanded of the girl.  "How long has it been here with you?"  "It came through the doorway just ahead of you," Bradley answered for the girl.  The Wieroo looked relieved.  "It is well for the girl that this is so," it said, "for now only you will have to die." And stepping to the door the creature raised its voice in one of those uncanny, depressing wails.  The Englishman looked toward the girl.  "Shall I kill it?" he asked, half drawing his pistol.  "What is best to do?--I do not wish to endanger you."  The Wieroo backed toward the door.  "Defiler!" it screamed. "You dare to threaten one of the sacred chosen of Luata!"  "Do not kill him," cried the girl, "for then there could be no hope for you.  That you are here, alive, shows that they may not intend to kill you at all, and so there is a chance for you if you do not anger them; but touch him in violence and your bleached skull will top the loftiest pedestal of Oo-oh."  "And what of you?" asked Bradley.  "I am already doomed," replied the girl; "I am cos-ata-lo."  "Cos-ata-lo! cos-ata-lu!"  What did these phrases mean that they were so oft repeated by the denizens of Oo-oh?  Lu and lo, Bradley knew to mean man and woman; ata; was employed variously to indicate life, eggs, young, reproduction and kindred subject; cos was a negative; but in combination they were meaningless to the European.  "Do you mean they will kill you?" asked Bradley.  "I but wish that they would," replied the girl.  "My fate is to be worse than death--in just a few nights more, with the coming of the new moon."  "Poor she-snake!" snapped the Wieroo.  "You are to become sacred above all other shes.  He Who Speaks for Luata has chosen you for himself.  Today you go to his temple--"the Wieroo used a phrase meaning literally High Place--"where you will receive the sacred commands."  The girl shuddered and cast a sorrowful glance toward Bradley. "Ah," she sighed, "if I could but see my beloved country once again!"  The man stepped suddenly close to her side before the Wieroo could interpose and in a low voice asked her if there was no way by which he might encompass her escape.  She shook her head sorrowfully.  "Even if we escaped the city," she replied, "there is the big water between the island of Oo-oh and the Galu shore."  "And what is beyond the city, if we could leave it?" pursued Bradley.  "I  may only guess from what I have heard since I was brought here," she answered; "but by reports and chance remarks I take it to be a beautiful land in which there are but few wild beasts and no men, for only the Wieroos live upon this island and they dwell always in cities of which there are three, this being the largest. The others are at the far end of the island, which is about three marches from end to end and at its widest point about one march."  From his own experience and from what the natives on the mainland had told him, Bradley knew that ten miles was a good day's march in Caspak, owing to the fact that at most points it was a trackless wilderness and at all times travelers were beset by hideous beasts and reptiles that greatly impeded rapid progress.  The two had spoken rapidly but were now interrupted by the advent through the opening in the roof of several Wieroos who had come in answer to the alarm it of the yellow slashing had uttered.  "This jaal-lu,"  cried the offended one, "has threatened me. Take its hatchet from it and make it fast where it can do no harm until He Who Speaks for Luata has said what shall be done with it.  It is one of those strange creatures that Fosh-bal-soj discovered first above the Band-lu country and followed back toward the beginning.  He Who Speaks for Luata sent Fosh-bal-soj to fetch him one of the creatures, and here it is.  It is hoped that it may be from another world and hold the secret of the cos-ata-lus."  The Wieroos approached boldly to take Bradley's "hatchet" from him, their leader having indicated the pistol hanging in its holster at the Englishman's hip, but the first one went reeling backward against his fellows from the blow to the chin which Bradley followed up with a rush and the intention to clean up the room in record time; but he had reckoned without the opening in the roof.  Two were down and a great wailing and moaning was arising when reinforcements appeared from above.  Bradley did not see them; but the girl did, and though she cried out a warning, it came too late for him to avoid a large Wieroo who dived headforemost for him, striking him between the shoulders and bearing him to the floor.  Instantly a dozen more were piling on top of him.  His pistol was wrenched from its holster and he was securely pinioned down by the weight of numbers.  At a word from the Wieroo of the yellow slashing who evidently was a person of authority, one left and presently returned with fiber ropes with which Bradley was tightly bound.  "Now bear him to the Blue Place of Seven Skulls," directed the chief Wieroo, "and one take the word of all that has passed to Him Who Speaks for Luata."  Each of the creatures raised a hand, the back against its face, as though in salute.  One seized Bradley and carried him through the yellow doorway to the roof from whence it rose upon its wide-spread wings and flapped off across the roof-tops of Oo-oh with its heavy burden clutched in its long talons.  Below him Bradley could see the city stretching away to a distance on every hand.  It was not as large as he had imagined, though he judged that it was at least three miles square. The houses were piled in indescribable heaps, sometimes to a height of a hundred feet.  The streets and alleys were short and crooked and there were many areas where buildings had been wedged in so closely that no light could possibly reach the lowest tiers, the entire surface of the ground being packed solidly with them.  The colors were varied and startling, the architecture amazing. Many roofs were cup or saucer-shaped with a small hole in the center of each, as though they had been constructed to catch rain-water and conduct it to a reservoir beneath; but nearly all the others had the large opening in the top that Bradley had seen used by these flying men in lieu of doorways.  At all levels were the myriad poles surmounted by grinning skulls; but the two most prominent features of the city were the round tower of human skulls that Bradley had noted earlier in the day and another and much larger edifice near the center of the city.  As they approached it, Bradley saw that it was a huge building rising a hundred feet in height from the ground and that it stood alone in the center of what might have been called a plaza in some other part of the world.  Its various parts, however, were set together with the same strange irregularity that marked the architecture of the city as a whole; and it was capped by an enormous saucer-shaped roof which projected far beyond the eaves, having the appearance of a colossal Chinese coolie hat, inverted.  The Wieroo bearing Bradley passed over one corner of the open space about the large building, revealing to the Englishman grass and trees and running water beneath.  They passed the building and about five hundred yards beyond the creature alighted on the roof of a square, blue building surmounted by seven poles bearing seven skulls.  This then, thought Bradley, is the Blue Place of Seven Skulls.  Over the opening in the roof was a grated covering, and this the Wieroo removed.  The thing then tied a piece of fiber rope to one of Bradley's ankles and rolled him over the edge of the opening. All was dark below and for an instant the Englishman came as near to experiencing real terror as he had ever come in his life before. As he rolled off into the black abyss he felt the rope tighten about his ankle and an instant later he was stopped with a sudden jerk to swing pendulumlike, head downward.  Then the creature lowered away until Bradley's head came in sudden and painful contact with the floor below, after which the Wieroo let loose of the rope entirely and the Englishman's body crashed to the wooden planking.  He felt the free end of the rope dropped upon him and heard the grating being slid into place above him.    Chapter 3   Half-stunned, Bradley lay for a minute as he had fallen and then slowly and painfully wriggled into a less uncomfortable position. He could see nothing of his surroundings in the gloom about him until after a few minutes his eyes became accustomed to the dark interior when he rolled them from side to side in survey of his prison.  He discovered himself to be in a bare room which was windowless, nor could he see any other opening than that through which he had been lowered.  In one corner was a huddled mass that might have been almost anything from a bundle of rags to a dead body.  Almost immediately after he had taken his bearings Bradley commenced working with his bonds.  He was a man of powerful physique, and as from the first he had been imbued with a belief that the fiber ropes were too weak to hold him, he worked on with a firm conviction that sooner or later they would part to his strainings.  After a matter of five minutes he was positive that the strands about his wrists were beginning to give; but he was compelled to rest then from exhaustion.  As he lay, his eyes rested upon the bundle in the corner, and presently he could have sworn that the thing moved.  With eyes straining through the gloom the man lay watching the grim and sinister thing in the corner.  Perhaps his overwrought nerves were playing a sorry joke upon him.  He thought of this and also that his condition of utter helplessness might still further have stimulated his imagination.  He closed his eyes and sought to relax his muscles and his nerves; but when he looked again, he knew that he had not been mistaken--the thing had moved; now it lay in a slightly altered form and farther from the wall.  It was nearer him.  With renewed strength Bradley strained at his bonds, his fascinated gaze still glued upon the shapeless bundle.  No longer was there any doubt that it moved--he saw it rise in the center several inches and then creep closer to him.  It sank and arose again--a headless, hideous, monstrous thing of menace.  Its very silence rendered it the more terrible.  Bradley was a brave man; ordinarily his nerves were of steel; but to be at the mercy of some unknown and nameless horror, to be unable to defend himself--it was these things that almost unstrung him, for at best he was only human.  To stand in the open, even with the odds all against him; to be able to use his fists, to put up some sort of defense, to inflict punishment upon his adversary--then he could face death with a smile.  It was not death that he feared now--it was that horror of the unknown that is part of the fiber of every son of woman.  Closer and closer came the shapeless mass.  Bradley lay motionless and listened.  What was that he heard!  Breathing? He could not be mistaken--and then from out of the bundle of rags issued a hollow groan.  Bradley felt his hair rise upon his head. He struggled with the slowly parting strands that held him. The thing beside him rose up higher than before and the Englishman could have sworn that he saw a single eye peering at him from among the tumbled cloth.  For a moment the bundle remained motionless--only the sound of breathing issued from it, then there broke from it a maniacal laugh.  Cold sweat stood upon Bradley's brow as he tugged for liberation. He saw the rags rise higher and higher above him until at last they tumbled upon the floor from the body of a naked man--a thin, a bony, a hideous caricature of man, that mouthed and mummed and, wabbling upon its weak and shaking legs, crumpled to the floor again, still laughing--laughing horribly.  It crawled toward Bradley.  "Food!  Food!" it screamed. "There is a way out! There is a way out!"  Dragging itself to his side the creature slumped upon the Englishman's breast.  "Food!" it shrilled as with its bony fingers and its teeth, it sought the man's bare throat.  "Food!  There is a way out!"  Bradley felt teeth upon his jugular. He turned and twisted, shaking himself free for an instant; but once more with hideous persistence the thing fastened itself upon him.  The weak jaws were unable to send the dull teeth through the victim's flesh; but Bradley felt it pawing, pawing, pawing, like a monstrous rat, seeking his life's blood.  The skinny arms now embraced his neck, holding the teeth to his throat against all his efforts to dislodge the thing.  Weak as it was it had strength enough for this in its mad efforts to eat. Mumbling as it worked, it repeated again and again, "Food!  Food! There is a way out!" until Bradley thought those two expressions alone would drive him mad.  And all but mad he was as with a final effort backed by almost maniacal strength he tore his wrists from the confining bonds and grasping the repulsive thing upon his breast hurled it halfway across the room.  Panting like a spent hound Bradley worked at the thongs about his ankles while the maniac lay quivering and mumbling where it had fallen.  Presently the Englishman leaped to his feet--freer than he had ever before felt in all his life, though he was still hopelessly a prisoner in the Blue Place of Seven Skulls.  With his back against the wall for support, so weak the reaction left him, Bradley stood watching the creature upon the floor. He saw it move and slowly raise itself to its hands and knees, where it swayed to and fro as its eyes roved about in search of him; and when at last they found him, there broke from the drawn lips the mumbled words:  "Food!  Food!  There is a way out!" The pitiful supplication in the tones touched the Englishman's heart. He knew that this could be no Wieroo, but possibly once a man like himself who had been cast into this pit of solitary confinement with this hideous result that might in time be his fate, also.  And then, too, there was the suggestion of hope held out by the constant reiteration of the phrase, "There is a way out." Was there a way out?  What did this poor thing know?  "Who are you and how long have you been here?" Bradley suddenly demanded.  For a moment the man upon the floor made no response, then mumblingly came the words:  "Food!  Food!"  "Stop!" commanded the Englishman--the injunction might have been barked from the muzzle of a pistol.  It brought the man to a sitting posture, his hands off the ground.  He stopped swaying to and fro and appeared to be startled into an attempt to master his faculties of concentration and thought.  Bradley repeated his questions sharply.  "I am An-Tak, the Galu," replied the man.  "Luata alone knows how long I have been here--maybe ten moons, maybe ten moons three times"--it was the Caspakian equivalent of thirty.  "I was young and strong when they brought me here.  Now I am old and very weak. I am cos-ata-lu--that is why they have not killed me. If I tell them the secret of becoming cos-ata-lu they will take me out; but how can I tell them that which Luata alone knows?  "What is cos-ata-lu?" demanded Bradley.  "Food!  Food!  There is a way out!" mumbled the Galu.  Bradley strode across the floor, seized the man by his shoulders and shook him.  "Tell me," he cried, "what is cos-ata-lu?"  "Food!" whimpered An-Tak.  Bradley bethought himself.  His haversack had not been taken from him.  In it besides his razor and knife were odds and ends of equipment and a small quantity of dried meat.  He tossed a small strip of the latter to the starving Galu.  An-Tak seized upon it and devoured it ravenously.  It instilled new life in the man.  "What is cos-ata-lu?" insisted Bradley again.  An-Tak tried to explain.  His narrative was often broken by lapses of concentration during which he reverted to his plaintive mumbling for food and recurrence to the statement that there was a way out; but by firmness and patience the Englishman drew out piece-meal a more or less lucid exposition of the remarkable scheme of evolution that rules in Caspak.  In it he found explanations of the hitherto inexplicable.  He discovered why he had seen no babes or children among the Caspakian tribes with which he had come in contact; why each more northerly tribe evinced a higher state of development than those south of them; why each tribe included individuals ranging in physical and mental characteristics from the highest of the next lower race to the lowest of the next higher, and why the women of each tribe immersed themselves morning for an hour or more in the warm pools near which the habitations of their people always were located; and, too, he discovered why those pools were almost immune from the attacks of carnivorous animals and reptiles.  He learned that all but those who were cos-ata-lu came up cor-sva-jo, or from the beginning.  The egg from which they first developed into tadpole form was deposited, with millions of others, in one of the warm pools and with it a poisonous serum that the carnivora instinctively shunned. Down the warm stream from the pool floated the countless billions of eggs and tadpoles, developing as they drifted slowly toward the sea.  Some became tadpoles in the pool, some in the sluggish stream and some not until they reached the great inland sea. In the next stage they became fishes or reptiles, An-Tak was not positive which, and in this form, always developing, they swam far to the south, where, amid the rank and teeming jungles, some of them evolved into amphibians.  Always there were those whose development stopped at the first stage, others whose development ceased when they became reptiles, while by far the greater proportion formed the food supply of the ravenous creatures of the deep.  Few indeed were those that eventually developed into baboons and then apes, which was considered by Caspakians the real beginning of evolution.  From the egg, then, the individual developed slowly into a higher form, just as the frog's egg develops through various stages from a fish with gills to a frog with lungs. With that thought in mind Bradley discovered that it was not difficult to believe in the possibility of such a scheme-- there was nothing new in it.  From the ape the individual, if it survived, slowly developed into the lowest order of man--the Alu--and then by degrees to Bo-lu, Sto-lu, Band-lu, Kro-lu and finally Galu.  And in each stage countless millions of other eggs were deposited in the warm pools of the various races and floated down to the great sea to go through a similar process of evolution outside the womb as develops our own young within; but in Caspak the scheme is much more inclusive, for it combines not only individual development but the evolution of species and genera.  If an egg survives it goes through all the stages of development that man has passed through during the unthinkable eons since life first moved upon the earth's face.  The final stage--that which the Galus have almost attained and for which all hope--is cos-ata-lu, which literally, means no-egg-man, or one who is born directly as are the young of the outer world of mammals.  Some of the Galus produce cos-ata-lu and cos-ata-lo both; the Weiroos only cos-ata-lu--in other words all Wieroos are born male, and so they prey upon the Galus for their women and sometimes capture and torture the Galu men who are cos-ata-lu in an endeavor to learn the secret which they believe will give them unlimited power over all other denizens of Caspak.  No Wieroos come up from the beginning--all are born of the Wieroo fathers and Galu mothers who are cos-ata-lo, and there are very few of the latter owing to the long and precarious stages of development.  Seven generations of the same ancestor must come up from the beginning before a cos-ata-lu child may be born; and when one considers the frightful dangers that surround the vital spark from the moment it leaves the warm pool where it has been deposited to float down to the sea amid the voracious creatures that swarm the surface and the deeps and the almost equally unthinkable trials of its effort to survive after it once becomes a land animal and starts northward through the horrors of the Caspakian jungles and forests, it is plainly a wonder that even a single babe has ever been born to a Galu woman.  Seven cycles it requires before the seventh Galu can complete the seventh danger-infested circle since its first Galu ancestor achieved the state of Galu.  For ages before, the ancestors of this first Galu may have developed from a Band-lu or Bo-lu egg without ever once completing the whole circle--that is from a Galu egg, back to a fully developed Galu.  Bradley's head was whirling before he even commenced to grasp the complexities of Caspakian evolution; but as the truth slowly filtered into his understanding--as gradually it became possible for him to visualize the scheme, it appeared simpler.  In fact, it seemed even less difficult of comprehension than that with which he was familiar.  For several minutes after An-Tak ceased speaking, his voice having trailed off weakly into silence, neither spoke again. Then the Galu recommenced his, "Food!  Food!  There is a way out!" Bradley tossed him another bit of dried meat, waiting patiently until he had eaten it, this time more slowly.  "What do you mean by saying there is a way out?" he asked.  "He who died here just after I came, told me," replied An-Tak. "He said there was a way out, that he had discovered it but was too weak to use his knowledge.  He was trying to tell me how to find it when he died.  Oh, Luata, if he had lived but a moment more!"  "They do not feed you here?" asked Bradley.  "No, they give me water once a day--that is all."  "But how have you lived, then?"  "The lizards and the rats," replied An-Tak. "The lizards are not so bad; but the rats are foul to taste.  However, I must eat them or they would eat me, and they are better than nothing; but of late they do not come so often, and I have not had a lizard for a long time.  I shall eat though," he mumbled.  "I shall eat now, for you cannot remain awake forever."  He laughed, a cackling, dry laugh.  "When you sleep, An-Tak will eat."  It was horrible.  Bradley shuddered.  For a long time each sat in silence.  The Englishman could guess why the other made no sound--he awaited the moment that sleep should overcome his victim. In the long silence there was born upon Bradley's ears a faint, monotonous sound as of running water.  He listened intently. It seemed to come from far beneath the floor.  "What is that noise?" he asked.  "That sounds like water running through a narrow channel."  "It is the river," replied An-Tak.  "Why do you not go to sleep? It passes directly beneath the Blue Place of Seven Skulls.  It runs through the temple grounds, beneath the temple and under the city. When we die, they will cut off our heads and throw our bodies into the river.  At the mouth of the river await many large reptiles. Thus do they feed.  The Wieroos do likewise with their own dead, keeping only the skulls and the wings.  Come, let us sleep."  "Do the reptiles come up the river into the city?" asked Bradley.  "The water is too cold--they never leave the warm water of the great pool," replied An-Tak.  "Let us search for the way out," suggested Bradley.  An-Tak shook his head.  "I have searched for it all these moons," he said.  "If I could not find it, how would you?"  Bradley made no reply but commenced a diligent examination of the walls and floor of the room, pressing over each square foot and tapping with his knuckles.  About six feet from the floor he discovered a sleeping-perch near one end of the apartment. He asked An-Tak about it, but the Galu said that no Weiroo had occupied the place since he had been incarcerated there. Again and again Bradley went over the floor and walls as high up as he could reach.  Finally he swung himself to the perch, that he might examine at least one end of the room all the way to the ceiling.  In the center of the wall close to the top, an area about three feet square gave forth a hollow sound when he rapped upon it. Bradley felt over every square inch of that area with the tips of his fingers.  Near the top he found a small round hole a trifle larger in diameter than his forefinger, which he immediately stuck into it.  The panel, if such it was, seemed about an inch thick, and beyond it his finger encountered nothing. Bradley crooked his finger upon the opposite side of the panel and pulled toward him, steadily but with considerable force. Suddenly the panel flew inward, nearly precipitating the man to the floor.  It was hinged at the bottom, and when lowered the outer edge rested upon the perch, making a little platform parallel with the floor of the room.  Beyond the opening was an utterly dark void.  The Englishman leaned through it and reached his arm as far as possible into the blackness but touched nothing.  Then he fumbled in his haversack for a match, a few of which remained to him.  When he struck it, An-Tak gave a cry of terror.  Bradley held the light far into the opening before him and in its flickering rays saw the top of a ladder descending into a black abyss below.  How far down it extended he could not guess; but that he should soon know definitely he was positive.  "You have found it!  You have found the way out!" screamed An-Tak. "Oh, Luata!  And now I am too weak to go.  Take me with you! Take me with you!"  "Shut up!" admonished Bradley.  "You will have the whole flock of birds around our heads in a minute, and neither of us will escape. Be quiet, and I'll go ahead.  If I find a way out, I'll come back and help you, if you'll promise not to try to eat me up again."  "I promise," cried An-Tak.  "Oh, Luata!  How could you blame me? I am half crazed of hunger and long confinement and the horror of the lizards and the rats and the constant waiting for death."  "I know," said Bradley simply.  "I'm sorry for you, old top. Keep a stiff upper lip."  And he slipped through the opening, found the ladder with his feet, closed the panel behind him, and started downward into the darkness.  Below him rose more and more distinctly the sound of running water. The air felt damp and cool.  He could see nothing of his surroundings and felt nothing but the smooth, worn sides and rungs of the ladder down which he felt his way cautiously lest a broken rung or a misstep should hurl him downward.  As he descended thus slowly, the ladder seemed interminable and the pit bottomless, yet he realized when at last he reached the bottom that he could not have descended more than fifty feet. The bottom of the ladder rested on a narrow ledge paved with what felt like large round stones, but what he knew from experience to be human skulls.  He could not but marvel as to where so many countless thousands of the things had come from, until he paused to consider that the infancy of Caspak dated doubtlessly back into remote ages, far beyond what the outer world considered the beginning of earthly time.  For all these eons the Wieroos might have been collecting human skulls from their enemies and their own dead--enough to have built an entire city of them.  Feeling his way along the narrow ledge, Bradley came presently to a blank wall that stretched out over the water swirling beneath him, as far as he could reach.  Stooping, he groped about with one hand, reaching down toward the surface of the water, and discovered that the bottom of the wall arched above the stream. How much space there was between the water and the arch he could not tell, nor how deep the former.  There was only one way in which he might learn these things, and that was to lower himself into the stream.  For only an instant he hesitated weighing his chances.  Behind him lay almost certainly the horrid fate of An-Tak; before him nothing worse than a comparatively painless death by drowning.  Holding his haversack above his head with one hand he lowered his feet slowly over the edge of the narrow platform. Almost immediately he felt the swirling of cold water about his ankles, and then with a silent prayer he let himself drop gently into the stream.  Great was Bradley's relief when he found the water no more than waist deep and beneath his feet a firm, gravel bottom. Feeling his way cautiously he moved downward with the current, which was not so strong as he had imagined from the noise of the running water.  Beneath the first arch he made his way, following the winding curvatures of the right-hand wall.  After a few yards of progress his hand came suddenly in contact with a slimy thing clinging to the wall--a thing that hissed and scuttled out of reach.  What it was, the man could not know; but almost instantly there was a splash in the water just ahead of him and then another.  On he went, passing beneath other arches at varying distances, and always in utter darkness.  Unseen denizens of this great sewer, disturbed by the intruder, splashed into the water ahead of him and wriggled away.  Time and again his hand touched them and never for an instant could he be sure that at the next step some gruesome thing might not attack him.  He had strapped his haversack about his neck, well above the surface of the water, and in his left hand he carried his knife.  Other precautions there were none to take.  The monotony of the blind trail was increased by the fact that from the moment he had started from the foot of the ladder he had counted his every step.  He had promised to return for An-Tak if it proved humanly possible to do so, and he knew that in the blackness of the tunnel he could locate the foot of the ladder in no other way.  He had taken two hundred and sixty-nine steps--afterward he knew that he should never forget that number--when something bumped gently against him from behind.  Instantly he wheeled about and with knife ready to defend himself stretched forth his right hand to push away the object that now had lodged against his body. His fingers feeling through the darkness came in contact with something cold and clammy--they passed to and fro over the thing until Bradley knew that it was the face of a dead man floating upon the surface of the stream.  With an oath he pushed his gruesome companion out into mid-stream to float on down toward the great pool and the awaiting scavengers of the deep.  At his four hundred and thirteenth step another corpse bumped against him--how many had passed him without touching he could not guess; but suddenly he experienced the sensation of being surrounded by dead faces floating along with him, all set in hideous grimaces, their dead eyes glaring at this profaning alien who dared intrude upon the waters of this river of the dead--a horrid escort, pregnant with dire forebodings and with menace.  Though he advanced very slowly, he tried always to take steps of about the same length; so that he knew that though considerable time had elapsed, yet he had really advanced no more than four hundred yards when ahead he saw a lessening of the pitch-darkness, and at the next turn of the stream his surroundings became vaguelydiscernible.  Above him was an arched roof and on either hand walls pierced at intervals by apertures covered with wooden doors.  Just ahead of him in the roof of the aqueduct was a round, black hole about thirty inches in diameter. His eyes still rested upon the opening when there shot downward from it to the water below the naked body of a human being which almost immediately rose to the surface again and floated off down the stream.  In the dim light Bradley saw that it was a dead Wieroo from which the wings and head had been removed.  A moment later another headless body floated past, recalling what An-Tak had told him of the skull-collecting customs of the Wieroo. Bradley wondered how it happened that the first corpse he had encountered in the stream had not been similarly mutilated.  The farther he advanced now, the lighter it became.  The number of corpses was much smaller than he had imagined, only two more passing him before, at six hundred steps, or about five hundred yards, from the point he had taken to the stream, he came to the end of the tunnel and looked out upon sunlit water, running between grassy banks.  One of the last corpses to pass him was still clothed in the white robe of a Wieroo, blood-stained over the headless neck that it concealed.  Drawing closer to the opening leading into the bright daylight, Bradley surveyed what lay beyond.  A short distance before him a large building stood in the center of several acres of grass and tree-covered ground, spanning the stream which disappeared through an opening in its foundation wall.  From the large saucer-shaped roof and the vivid colorings of the various heterogeneous parts of the structure he recognized it as the temple past which he had been borne to the Blue Place of Seven Skulls.  To and fro flew Wieroos, going to and from the temple. Others passed on foot across the open grounds, assisting themselves with their great wings, so that they barely skimmed the earth.  To leave the mouth of the tunnel would have been to court instant discovery and capture; but by what other avenue he might escape, Bradley could not guess, unless he retraced his steps up the stream and sought egress from the other end of the city.  The thought of traversing that dark and horror-ridden tunnel for perhaps miles he could not entertain--there must be some other way.  Perhaps after dark he could steal through the temple grounds and continue on downstream until he had come beyond the city; and so he stood and waited until his limbs became almost paralyzed with cold, and he knew that he must find some other plan for escape.  A half-formed decision to risk an attempt to swim under water to the temple was crystallizing in spite of the fact that any chance Wieroo flying above the stream might easily see him, when again a floating object bumped against him from behind and lodged across his back.  Turning quickly he saw that the thing was what he had immediately guessed it to be--a headless and wingless Wieroo corpse.  With a grunt of disgust he was about to push it from him when the white garment enshrouding it suggested a bold plan to his resourceful brain.  Grasping the corpse by an arm he tore the garment from it and then let the body float downward toward the temple.  With great care he draped the robe about him; the bloody blotch that had covered the severed neck he arranged about his own head.  His haversack he rolled as tightly as possible and stuffed beneath his coat over his breast.  Then he fell gently to the surface of the stream and lying upon his back floated downward with the current and out into the open sunlight.  Through the weave of the cloth he could distinguish large objects. He saw a Wieroo flap dismally above him; he saw the banks of the stream float slowly past; he heard a sudden wail upon the right- hand shore, and his heart stood still lest his ruse had been discovered; but never by a move of a muscle did he betray that aught but a cold lump of clay floated there upon the bosom of the water, and soon, though it seemed an eternity to him, the direct sunlight was blotted out, and he knew that he had entered beneath the temple.  Quickly he felt for bottom with his feet and as quickly stood erect, snatching the bloody, clammy cloth from his face.  On both sides were blank walls and before him the river turned a sharp corner and disappeared.  Feeling his way cautiously forward he approached the turn and looked around the corner.  To his left was a low platform about a foot above the level of the stream, and onto this he lost no time in climbing, for he was soaked from head to foot, cold and almost exhausted.  As he lay resting on the skull-paved shelf, he saw in the center of the vault above the river another of those sinister round holes through which he momentarily expected to see a headless corpse shoot downward in its last plunge to a watery grave. A few feet along the platform a closed door broke the blankness of the wall.  As he lay looking at it and wondering what lay behind, his mind filled with fragments of many wild schemes of escape, it opened and a white robed Wieroo stepped out upon the platform. The creature carried a large wooden basin filled with rubbish. Its eyes were not upon Bradley, who drew himself to a squatting position and crouched as far back in the corner of the niche in which the platform was set as he could force himself.  The Wieroo stepped to the edge of the platform and dumped the rubbish into the stream.  If it turned away from him as it started to retrace its steps to the doorway, there was a small chance that it might not see him; but if it turned toward him there was none at all. Bradley held his breath.  The Wieroo paused a moment, gazing down into the water, then it straightened up and turned toward the Englishman.  Bradley did not move.  The Wieroo stopped and stared intently at him. It approached him questioningly.  Still Bradley remained as though carved of stone.  The creature was directly in front of him.  It stopped.  There was no chance on earth that it would not discover what he was.  With the quickness of a cat, Bradley sprang to his feet and with all his great strength, backed by his heavy weight, struck the Wieroo upon the point of the chin.  Without a sound the thing crumpled to the platform, while Bradley, acting almost instinctively to the urge of the first law of nature, rolled the inanimate body over the edge into the river.  Then he looked at the open doorway, crossed the platform and peered within the apartment beyond.  What he saw was a large room, dimly lighted, and about the side rows of wooden vessels stacked one upon another.  There was no Wieroo in sight, so the Englishman entered.  At the far end of the room was another door, and as he crossed toward it, he glanced into some of the vessels, which he found were filled with dried fruits, vegetables and fish. Without more ado he stuffed his pockets and his haversack full, thinking of the poor creature awaiting his return in the gloom of the Place of Seven Skulls.  When night came, he would return and fetch An-Tak this far at least; but in the meantime it was his intention to reconnoiter in the hope that he might discover some easier way out of the city than that offered by the chill, black channel of the ghastly river of corpses.  Beyond the farther door stretched a long passageway from which closed doorways led into other parts of the cellars of the temple.  A few yards from the storeroom a ladder rose from the corridor through an aperture in the ceiling.  Bradley paused at the foot of it, debating the wisdom of further investigation against a return to the river; but strong within him was the spirit of exploration that has scattered his race to the four corners of the earth.  What new mysteries lay hidden in the chambers above?  The urge to know was strong upon him though his better judgment warned him that the safer course lay in retreat. For a moment he stood thus, running his fingers through his hair; then he cast discretion to the winds and began the ascent.  In conformity with such Wieroo architecture as he had already observed, the well through which the ladder rose continually canted at an angle from the perpendicular.  At more or less regular stages it was pierced by apertures closed by doors, none of which he could open until he had climbed fully fifty feet from the river level.  Here he discovered a door already ajar opening into a large, circular chamber, the walls and floors of which were covered with the skins of wild beasts and with rugs of many colors; but what interested him most was the occupants of the room--a Wieroo, and a girl of human proportions.  She was standing with her back against a column which rose from the center of the apartment from floor to ceiling--a hollow column about forty inches in diameter in which he could see an opening some thirty inches across.  The girl's side was toward Bradley, and her face averted, for she was watching the Wieroo, who was now advancing slowly toward her, talking as he came.  Bradley could distinctly hear the words of the creature, who was urging the girl to accompany him to another Wieroo city.  "Come with me," he said, "and you shall have your life; remain here and He Who Speaks for Luata will claim you for his own; and when he is done with you, your skull will bleach at the top of a tall staff while your body feeds the reptiles at the mouth of the River of Death. Even though you bring into the world a female Wieroo, your fate will be the same if you do not escape him, while with me you shall have life and food and none shall harm you."  He was quite close to the girl when she replied by striking him in the face with all her strength.  "Until I am slain," she cried, "I shall fight against you all."  From the throat of the Wieroo issued that dismal wail that Bradley had heard so often in the past--it was like a scream of pain smothered to a groan--and then the thing leaped upon the girl, its face working in hideous grimaces as it clawed and beat at her to force her to the floor.  The Englishman was upon the point of entering to defend her when a door at the opposite side of the chamber opened to admit a huge Wieroo clothed entirely in red.  At sight of the two struggling upon the floor the newcomer raised his voice in a shriek of rage. Instantly the Wieroo who was attacking the girl leaped to his feet and faced the other.  "I heard," screamed he who had just entered the room.  "I heard, and when He Who Speaks for Lu-ata shall have heard--" He paused and made a suggestive movement of a finger across his throat.  "He shall not hear," returned the first Wieroo as, with a powerful motion of his great wings, he launched himself upon the red-robed figure.  The latter dodged the first charge, drew a wicked-looking curved blade from beneath its red robe, spread its wings and dived for its antagonist.  Beating their wings, wailing and groaning, the two hideous things sparred for position. The white-robed one being unarmed sought to grasp the other by the wrist of its knife-hand and by the throat, while the latter hopped around on its dainty white feet, seeking an opening for a mortal blow.  Once it struck and missed, and then the other rushed in and clinched, at the same time securing both the holds it sought.  Immediately the two commenced beating at each other's heads with the joints of their wings, kicking with their soft, puny feet and biting, each at the other's face.  In the meantime the girl moved about the room, keeping out of the way of the duelists, and as she did so, Bradley caught a glimpse of her full face and immediately recognized her as the girl of the place of the yellow door.  He did not dare intervene now until one of the Wieroo had overcome the other, lest the two should turn upon him at once, when the chances were fair that he would be defeated in so unequal a battle as the curved blade of the red Wieroo would render it, and so he waited, watching the white-robed figure slowly choking the life from him of the red robe. The protruding tongue and the popping eyes proclaimed that the end was near and a moment later the red robe sank to the floor of the room, the curved blade slipping from nerveless fingers. For an instant longer the victor clung to the throat of his defeated antagonist and then he rose, dragging the body after him, and approached the central column.  Here he raised the body and thrust it into the aperture where Bradley saw it drop suddenly from sight.  Instantly there flashed into his memory the circular openings in the roof of the river vault and the corpses he had seen drop from them to the water beneath.  As the body disappeared, the Wieroo turned and cast about the room for the girl.  For a moment he stood eying her.  "You saw," he muttered, "and if you tell them, He Who Speaks for Luata will have my wings severed while still I live and my head will be severed and I shall be cast into the River of Death, for thus it happens even to the highest who slay one of the red robe.  You saw, and you must die!" he ended with a scream as he rushed upon the girl.  Bradley waited no longer.  Leaping into the room he ran for the Wieroo, who had already seized the girl, and as he ran, he stooped and picked up the curved blade.  The creature's back was toward him as, with his left hand, he seized it by the neck. Like a flash the great wings beat backward as the creature turned, and Bradley was swept from his feet, though he still retained his hold upon the blade.  Instantly the Wieroo was upon him.  Bradley lay slightly raised upon his left elbow, his right arm free, and as the thing came close, he cut at the hideous face with all the strength that lay within him.  The blade struck at the junction of the neck and torso and with such force as to completely decapitate the Wieroo, the hideous head dropping to the floor and the body falling forward upon the Englishman. Pushing it from him he rose to his feet and faced the wide-eyed girl.  "Luata!" she exclaimed.  "How came you here?"  Bradley shrugged.  "Here I am," he said; "but the thing now is to get out of here--both of us."  The girl shook her head.  "It cannot be," she stated sadly.  "That is what I thought when they dropped me into the Blue Place of Seven Skulls," replied Bradley.  "Can't be done.  I did it.-- Here!  You're mussing up the floor something awful, you."  This last to the dead Wieroo as he stooped and dragged the corpse to the central shaft, where he raised it to the aperture and let it slip into the tube.  Then he picked up the head and tossed it after the body.  "Don't be so glum," he admonished the former as he carried it toward the well; "smile!"  "But how can he smile?" questioned the girl, a half-puzzled, half-frightened look upon her face.  "He is dead."  "That's so," admitted Bradley, "and I suppose he does feel a bit cut up about it."  The girl shook her head and edged away from the man--toward the door.  "Come!" said the Englishman.  "We've got to get out of here. If you don't know a better way than the river, it's the river then."  The girl still eyed him askance.  "But how could he smile when he was dead?"  Bradley laughed aloud.  "I thought we English were supposed to have the least sense of humor of any people in the world," he cried; "but now I've found one human being who hasn't any. Of course you don't know half I'm saying; but don't worry, little girl; I'm not going to hurt you, and if I can get you out of here, I'll do it."  Even if she did not understand all he said, she at least read something in his smiling, countenance--something which reassured her. "I do not fear you," she said; "though I do not understand all that you say even though you speak my own tongue and use words that I know.  But as for escaping"--she sighed--"alas, how can it be done?"  "I escaped from the Blue Place of Seven Skulls," Bradley reminded her.  "Come!"  And he turned toward the shaft and the ladder that he had ascended from the river.  "We cannot waste time here."  The girl followed him; but at the doorway both drew back, for from below came the sound of some one ascending.  Bradley tiptoed to the door and peered cautiously into the well; then he stepped back beside the girl.  "There are half a dozen of them coming up; but possibly they will pass this room."  "No," she said, "they will pass directly through this room--they are on their way to Him Who Speaks for Luata.  We may be able to hide in the next room--there are skins there beneath which we may crawl.  They will not stop in that room; but they may stop in this one for a short time--the other room is blue."  "What's that go to do with it?" demanded the Englishman.  "They fear blue," she replied.  "In every room where murder has been done you will find blue--a certain amount for each murder. When the room is all blue, they shun it.  This room has much blue; but evidently they kill mostly in the next room, which is now all blue."  "But there is blue on the outside of every house I have seen," said Bradley.  "Yes, " assented the girl, "and there are blue rooms in each of those houses--when all the rooms are blue then the whole outside of the house will be blue as is the Blue Place of Seven Skulls. There are many such here."  "And the skulls with blue upon them?" inquired Bradley. "Did they belong to murderers?"  "They were murdered--some of them; those with only a small amount of blue were murderers--known murderers.  All Wieroos are murderers. When they have committed a certain number of murders without being caught at it, they confess to Him Who Speaks for Luata and are advanced, after which they wear robes with a slash of some color-- I think yellow comes first.  When they reach a point where the entire robe is of yellow, they discard it for a white robe with a red slash; and when one wins a complete red robe, he carries such a long, curved knife as you have in your hand; after that comes the blue slash on a white robe, and then, I suppose, an all blue robe. I have never seen such a one."  As they talked in low tones they had moved from the room of the death shaft into an all blue room adjoining, where they sat down together in a corner with their backs against a wall and drew a pile of hides over themselves.  A moment later they heard a number of Wieroos enter the chamber.  They were talking together as they crossed the floor, or the two could not have heard them. Halfway across the chamber they halted as the door toward which they were advancing opened and a dozen others of their kind entered the apartment.  Bradley could guess all this by the increased volume of sound and the dismal greetings; but the sudden silence that almost immediately ensued he could not fathom, for he could not know that from beneath one of the hides that covered him protruded one of his heavy army shoes, or that some eighteen large Wieroos with robes either solid red or slashed with red or blue were standing gazing at it.  Nor could he hear their stealthy approach.  The first intimation he had that he had been discovered was when his foot was suddenly seized, and he was yanked violently from beneath the hides to find himself surrounded by menacing blades. They would have slain him on the spot had not one clothed all in red held them back, saying that He Who Speaks for Luata desired to see this strange creature.  As they led Bradley away, he caught an opportunity to glance back toward the hides to see what had become of the girl, and, to his gratification, he discovered that she still lay concealed beneath the hides.  He wondered if she would have the nerve to attempt the river trip alone and regretted that now he could not accompany her.  He felt rather all in, himself, more so than he had at any time since he had been captured by the Wieroo, for there appeared not the slightest cause for hope in his present predicament.  He had dropped the curved blade beneath the hides when he had been jerked so violently from their fancied security. It was almost in a spirit of resigned hopelessness that he quietly accompanied his captors through various chambers and corridors toward the heart of the temple.    Chapter 4   The farther the group progressed, the more barbaric and the more sumptuous became the decorations.  Hides of leopard and tiger predominated, apparently because of their more beautiful markings, and decorative skulls became more and more numerous. Many of the latter were mounted in precious metals and set with colored stones and priceless gems, while thick upon the hides that covered the walls were golden ornaments similar to those worn by the girl and those which had filled the chests he had examined in the storeroom of Fosh-bal-soj, leading the Englishman to the conviction that all such were spoils of war or theft, since each piece seemed made for personal adornment, while in so far as he had seen, no Wieroo wore ornaments of any sort.  And also as they advanced the more numerous became the Wieroos moving hither and thither within the temple.  Many now were the solid red robes and those that were slashed with blue--a veritable hive of murderers.  At last the party halted in a room in which were many Wieroos who gathered about Bradley questioning his captors and examining him and his apparel.  One of the party accompanying the Englishman spoke to a Wieroo that stood beside a door leading from the room. "Tell Him Who Speaks for Luata," he said, "that Fosh-bal-soj we could not find; but that in returning we found this creature within the temple, hiding.  It must be the same that Fosh-bal-soj captured in the Sto-lu country during the last darkness. Doubtless He Who Speaks for Luata would wish to see and question this strange thing."  The creature addressed turned and slipped through the doorway, closing the door after it, but first depositing its curved blade upon the floor without.  Its post was immediately taken by another and Bradley now saw that at least twenty such guards loitered in the immediate vicinity.  The doorkeeper was gone but for a moment, and when he returned, he signified that Bradley's party was to enter the next chamber; but first each of the Wieroos removed his curved weapon and laid it upon the floor. The door was swung open, and the party, now reduced to Bradley and five Wieroos, was ushered across the threshold into a large, irregularly shaped room in which a single, giant Wieroo whose robe was solid blue sat upon a raised dais.  The creature's face was white with the whiteness of a corpse, its dead eyes entirely expressionless, its cruel, thin lips tight-drawn against yellow teeth in a perpetual grimace.  Upon either side of it lay an enormous, curved sword, similar to those with which some of the other Wieroos had been armed, but larger and heavier. Constantly its clawlike fingers played with one or the other of these weapons.  The walls of the chamber as well as the floor were entirely hidden by skins and woven fabrics.  Blue predominated in all the colorations.  Fastened against the hides were many pairs of Wieroo wings, mounted so that they resembled long, black shields. Upon the ceiling were painted in blue characters a bewildering series of hieroglyphics and upon pedestals set against the walls or standing out well within the room were many human skulls.  As the Wieroos approached the figure upon the dais, they leaned far forward, raising their wings above their heads and stretching their necks as though offering them to the sharp swords of the grim and hideous creature.  "O Thou Who Speakest for Luata!" exclaimed one of the party. "We bring you the strange creature that Fosh-bal-soj captured and brought thither at thy command."  So this then was the godlike figure that spoke for divinity! This arch-murderer was the Caspakian representative of God on Earth! His blue robe announced him the one and the seeming humility of his minions the other.  For a long minute he glared at Bradley.  Then he began to question him--from whence he came and how, the name and description of his native country, and a hundred other queries.  "Are you cos-ata-lu?" the creature asked.  Bradley replied that he was and that all his kind were, as well as every living thing in his part of the world.  "Can you tell me the secret?" asked the creature.  Bradley hesitated and then, thinking to gain time, replied in the affirmative.  "What is it?" demanded the Wieroo, leaning far forward and exhibiting every evidence of excited interest.  Bradley leaned forward and whispered:  "It is for your ears alone; I will not divulge it to others, and then only on condition that you carry me and the girl I saw in the place of the yellow door near to that of Fosh-bal-soj back to her own country."  The thing rose in wrath, holding one of its swords above its head.  "Who are you to make terms for Him Who Speaks for Luata?" it shrilled.  "Tell me the secret or die where you stand!"  "And if I die now, the secret goes with me," Bradley reminded him. "Never again will you get the opportunity to question another of my kind who knows the secret."  Anything to gain time, to get the rest of the Wieroos from the room, that he might plan some scheme for escape and put it into effect.  The creature turned upon the leader of the party that had brought Bradley.  "Is the thing with weapons?" it asked.  "No," was the response.  "Then go; but tell the guard to remain close by," commanded the high one.  The Wieroos salaamed and withdrew, closing the door behind them. He Who Speaks for Luata grasped a sword nervously in his right hand. At his left side lay the second weapon.  It was evident that he lived in constant dread of being assassinated.  The fact that he permitted none with weapons within his presence and that he always kept two swords at his side pointed to this.  Bradley was racking his brain to find some suggestion of a plan whereby he might turn the situation to his own account.  His eyes wandered past the weird figure before him; they played about the walls of the apartment as though hoping to draw inspiration from the dead skulls and the hides and the wings, and then they came back to the face of the Wieroo god, now working in anger.  "Quick!" screamed the thing.  "The secret!"  "Will you give me and the girl our freedom?" insisted Bradley.  For an instant the thing hesitated, and then it grumbled "Yes." At the same instant Bradley saw two hides upon the wall directly back of the dais separate and a face appear in the opening. No change of expression upon the Englishman's countenance betrayed that he had seen aught to surprise him, though surprised he was for the face in the aperture was that of the girl he had but just left hidden beneath the hides in another chamber.  A white and shapely arm now pushed past the face into the room, and in the hand, tightly clutched, was the curved blade, smeared with blood, that Bradley had dropped beneath the hides at the moment he had been discovered and drawn from his concealment.  "Listen, then," said Bradley in a low voice to the Wieroo. "You shall know the secret of cos-ata-lu as well as do I; but none other may hear it.  Lean close--I will whisper it into your ear."  He moved forward and stepped upon the dais.  The creature raised its sword ready to strike at the first indication of treachery, and Bradley stooped beneath the blade and put his ear close to the gruesome face.  As he did so, he rested his weight upon his hands, one upon either side of the Wieroo's body, his right hand upon the hilt of the spare sword lying at the left of Him Who Speaks for Luata.  "This then is the secret of both life and death," he whispered, and at the same instant he grasped the Wieroo by the right wrist and with his own right hand swung the extra blade in a sudden vicious blow against the creature's neck before the thing could give even a single cry of alarm; then without waiting an instant Bradley leaped past the dead god and vanished behind the hides that had hidden the girl.  Wide-eyed and panting the girl seized his arm.  "Oh, what have you done?" she cried.  "He Who Speaks for Luata will be avenged by Luata.  Now indeed must you die.  There is no escape, for even though we reached my own country Luata can find you out."  "Bosh!" exclaimed Bradley, and then:  "But you were going to knife him yourself."  "Then I alone should have died," she replied.  Bradley scratched his head.  "Neither of us is going to die," he said; "at least not at the hands of any god.  If we don't get out of here though, we'll die right enough.  Can you find your way back to the room where I first came upon you in the temple?"  "I know the way," replied the girl; "but I doubt if we can go back without being seen.  I came hither because I only met Wieroos who knew that I am supposed now to be in the temple; but you could go elsewhere without being discovered."  Bradley's ingenuity had come up against a stone wall. There seemed no possibility of escape.  He looked about him. They were in a small room where lay a litter of rubbish--torn bits of cloth, old hides, pieces of fiber rope.  In the center of the room was a cylindrical shaft with an opening in its face. Bradley knew it for what it was.  Here the arch-fiend dragged his victims and cast their bodies into the river of death far below. The floor about the opening in the shaft and the sides of the shaft were clotted thick with a dried, dark brown substance that the Englishman knew had once been blood.  The place had the appearance of having been a veritable shambles.  An odor of decaying flesh permeated the air.  The Englishman crossed to the shaft and peered into the opening. All below was dark as pitch; but at the bottom he knew was the river.  Suddenly an inspiration and a bold scheme leaped to his mind.  Turning quickly he hunted about the room until he found what he sought--a quantity of the rope that lay strewn here and there.  With rapid fingers he unsnarled the different lengths, the girl helping him, and then he tied the ends together until he had three ropes about seventy-five feet in length.  He fastened these together at each end and without a word secured one of the ends about the girl's body beneath her arms.  "Don't be frightened," he said at length, as he led her toward the opening in the shaft.  "I'm going to lower you to the river, and then I'm coming down after you.  When you are safe below, give two quick jerks upon the rope.  If there is danger there and you want me to draw you up into the shaft, jerk once.  Don't be afraid--it is the only way."  "I am not afraid," replied the girl, rather haughtily Bradley thought, and herself climbed through the aperture and hung by her hands waiting for Bradley to lower her.  As rapidly as was consistent with safety, the man paid out the rope. When it was about half out, he heard loud cries and wails suddenly arise within the room they had just quitted.  The slaying of their god had been discovered by the Wieroos.  A search for the slayer would begin at once.  Lord!  Would the girl never reach the river?  At last, just as he was positive that searchers were already entering the room behind him, there came two quick tugs at the rope.  Instantly Bradley made the rest of the strands fast about the shaft, slipped into the black tube and began a hurried descent toward the river. An instant later he stood waist deep in water beside the girl. Impulsively she reached toward him and grasped his arm. A strange thrill ran through him at the contact; but he only cut the rope from about her body and lifted her to the little shelf at the river's side.  "How can we leave here?" she asked.  "By the river," he replied; "but first I must go back to the Blue Place of Seven Skulls and get the poor devil I left there. I'll have to wait until after dark, though, as I cannot pass through the open stretch of river in the temple gardens by day."  "There is another way," said the girl.  "I have never seen it; but often I have heard them speak of it--a corridor that runs beside the river from one end of the city to the other. Through the gardens it is below ground.  If we could find an entrance to it, we could leave here at once.  It is not safe here, for they will search every inch of the temple and the grounds."  "Come," said Bradley.  "We'll have a look for it, anyway." And so saying he approached one of the doors that opened onto the skull-paved shelf.  They found the corridor easily, for it paralleled the river, separated from it only by a single wall.  It took them beneath the gardens and the city, always through inky darkness.  After they had reached the other side of the gardens, Bradley counted his steps until he had retraced as many as he had taken coming down the stream; but though they had to grope their way along, it was a much more rapid trip than the former.  When he thought he was about opposite the point at which he had descended from the Blue Place of Seven Skulls, he sought and found a doorway leading out onto the river; and then, still in the blackest darkness, he lowered himself into the stream and felt up and down upon the opposite side for the little shelf and the ladder.  Ten yards from where he had emerged he found them, while the girl waited upon the opposite side.  To ascend to the secret panel was the work of but a minute. Here he paused and listened lest a Wieroo might be visiting the prison in search of him or the other inmate; but no sound came from the gloomy interior.  Bradley could not but muse upon the joy of the man on the opposite side when he should drop down to him with food and a new hope for escape.  Then he opened the panel and looked into the room.  The faint light from the grating above revealed the pile of rags in one corner; but the man lay beneath them, he made no response to Bradley's low greeting.  The Englishman lowered himself to the floor of the room and approached the rags.  Stooping he lifted a corner of them. Yes, there was the man asleep.  Bradley shook him--there was no response.  He stooped lower and in the dim light examined An-Tak; then he stood up with a sigh.  A rat leaped from beneath the coverings and scurried away.  "Poor devil!" muttered Bradley.  He crossed the room to swing himself to the perch preparatory to quitting the Blue Place of Seven Skulls forever.  Beneath the perch he paused.  "I'll not give them the satisfaction," he growled. "Let them believe that he escaped."  Returning to the pile of rags he gathered the man into his arms. It was difficult work raising him to the high perch and dragging him through the small opening and thus down the ladder; but presently it was done, and Bradley had lowered the body into the river and cast it off.  "Good-bye, old top!" he whispered.  A moment later he had rejoined the girl and hand in hand they were following the dark corridor upstream toward the farther end of the city.  She told him that the Wieroos seldom frequented these lower passages, as the air here was too chill for them; but occasionally they came, and as they could see quite as well by night as by day, they would be sure to discover Bradley and the girl.  "If they come close enough," she said, "we can see their eyes shining in the dark--they resemble dull splotches of light. They glow, but do not blaze like the eyes of the tiger or the lion."  The man could not but note the very evident horror with which she mentioned the creatures.  To him they were uncanny; but she had been used to them for a year almost, and probably all her life she had either seen or heard of them constantly.  "Why do you fear them so?" he asked.  "It seems more than any ordinary fear of the harm they can do you."  She tried to explain; but the nearest he could gather was that she looked upon the Wieroo almost as supernatural beings. "There is a legend current among my people that once the Wieroo were unlike us only in that they possessed rudimentary wings. They lived in villages in the Galu country, and while the two peoples often warred, they held no hatred for one another.  In those days each race came up from the beginning and there was great rivalry as to which was the higher in the scale of evolution.  The Wieroo developed the first cos-ata-lu but they were always male-- never could they reproduce woman.  Slowly they commenced to develop certain attributes of the mind which, they considered, placed them upon a still higher level and which gave them many advantages over us, seeing which they thought only of mental development--their minds became like stars and the rivers, moving always in the same manner, never varying.  They called this tas-ad, which means doing everything the right way, or, in other words, the Wieroo way.  If foe or friend, right or wrong, stood in the way of tas-ad, then it must be crushed.  "Soon the Galus and the lesser races of men came to hate and fear them.  It was then that the Wieroos decided to carry tas-ad into every part of the world.  They were very warlike and very numerous, although they had long since adopted the policy of slaying all those among them whose wings did not show advanced development.  "It took ages for all this to happen--very slowly came the different changes; but at last the Wieroos had wings they could use.  But by reason of always making war upon their neighbors they were hated by every creature of Caspak, for no one wanted their tas-ad, and so they used their wings to fly to this island when the other races turned against them and threatened to kill them all.  So cruel had they become and so bloodthirsty that they no longer had hearts that beat with love or sympathy; but their very cruelty and wickedness kept them from conquering the other races, since they were also cruel and wicked to one another, so that no Wieroo trusted another.  "Always were they slaying those above them that they might rise in power and possessions, until at last came the more powerful than the others with a tas-ad all his own.  He gathered about him a few of the most terrible Wieroos, and among them they made laws which took from all but these few Wieroos every weapon they possessed.  "Now their tas-ad has reached a high plane among them. They make many wonderful things that we cannot make.  They think great thoughts, no doubt, and still dream of greatness to come, but their thoughts and their acts are regulated by ages of custom--they are all alike--and they are most unhappy."  As the girl talked, the two moved steadily along the dark passageway beside the river.  They had advanced a considerable distance when there sounded faintly from far ahead the muffled roar of falling water, which increased in volume as they moved forward until at last it filled the corridor with a deafening sound. Then the corridor ended in a blank wall; but in a niche to the right was a ladder leading aloft, and to the left was a door opening onto the river.  Bradley tried the latter first and as he opened it, felt a heavy spray against his face. The little shelf outside the doorway was wet and slippery, the roaring of the water tremendous.  There could be but one explanation--they had reached a waterfall in the river, and if the corridor actually terminated here, their escape was effectually cut off, since it was quite evidently impossible to follow the bed of the river and ascend the falls.  As the ladder was the only alternative, the two turned toward it and, the man first, began the ascent, which was through a well similar to that which had led him to the upper floors of the temple.  As he climbed, Bradley felt for openings in the sides of the shaft; but he discovered none below fifty feet.  The first he came to was ajar, letting a faint light into the well.  As he paused, the girl climbed to his side, and together they looked through the crack into a low-ceiled chamber in which were several Galu women and an equal number of hideous little replicas of the full-grown Wieroos with which Bradley was not quite familiar.  He could feel the body of the girl pressed close to his tremble as her eyes rested upon the inmates of the room, and involuntarily his arm encircled her shoulders as though to protect her from some danger which he sensed without recognizing.  "Poor things," she whispered.  "This is their horrible fate--to be imprisoned here beneath the surface of the city with their hideous offspring whom they hate as they hate their fathers. A Wieroo keeps his children thus hidden until they are full-grown lest they be murdered by their fellows.  The lower rooms of the city are filled with many such as these."  Several feet above was a second door beyond which they found a small room stored with food in wooden vessels.  A grated window in one wall opened above an alley, and through it they could see that they were just below the roof of the building.  Darkness was coming, and at Bradley's suggestion they decided to remain hidden here until after dark and then to ascend to the roof and reconnoiter.  Shortly after they had settled themselves they heard something descending the ladder from above.  They hoped that it would continue on down the well and fairly held their breath as the sound approached the door to the storeroom.  Their hearts sank as they heard the door open and from between cracks in the vessels behind which they hid saw a yellow-slashed Wieroo enter the room. Each recognized him immediately, the girl indicating the fact of her own recognition by a sudden pressure of her fingers on Bradley's arm.  It was the Wieroo of the yellow slashing whose abode was the place of the yellow door in which Bradley had first seen the girl.  The creature carried a wooden bowl which it filled with dried food from several of the vessels; then it turned and quit the room. Bradley could see through the partially open doorway that it descended the ladder.  The girl told him that it was taking the food to the women and the young below, and that while it might return immediately, the chances were that it would remain for some time.  "We are just below the place of the yellow door," she said. "It is far from the edge of the city; so far that we may not hope to escape if we ascend to the roofs here."  "I think," replied the man, "that of all the places in Oo-oh this will be the easiest to escape from.  Anyway, I want to return to the place of the yellow door and get my pistol if it is there."  "It is still there," replied, the girl.  "I saw it placed in a chest where he keeps the things he takes from his prisoners and victims."  "Good!" exclaimed Bradley.  "Now come, quickly.  "And the two crossed the room to the well and ascended the ladder a short distance to its top where they found another door that opened into a vacant room--the same in which Bradley had first met the girl.  To find the pistol was a matter of but a moment's search on the part of Bradley's companion; and then, at the Englishman's signal, she followed him to the yellow door.  It was quite dark without as the two entered the narrow passage between two buildings.  A few steps brought them undiscovered to the doorway of the storeroom where lay the body of Fosh-bal-soj. In the distance, toward the temple, they could hear sounds as of a great gathering of Wieroos--the peculiar, uncanny wailing rising above the dismal flapping of countless wings.  "They have heard of the killing of Him Who Speaks for Luata," whispered the girl.  "Soon they will spread in all directions searching for us."  "And will they find us?"  "As surely as Lua gives light by day," she replied; "and when they find us, they will tear us to pieces, for only the Wieroos may murder--only they may practice tas-ad."  "But they will not kill you," said Bradley.  "You did not slay him."  "It will make no difference," she insisted.  "If they find us together they will slay us both."  "Then they won't find us together," announced Bradley decisively. "You stay right here--you won't be any worse off than before I came--and I'll get as far as I can and account for as many of the beggars as possible before they get me.  Good-bye!  You're a mighty decent little girl.  I wish that I might have helped you."  "No," she cried.  "Do not leave me.  I would rather die.  I had hoped and hoped to find some way to return to my own country. I wanted to go back to An-Tak, who must be very lonely without me; but I know that it can never be.  It is difficult to kill hope, though mine is nearly dead.  Do not leave me."  "An-Tak!" Bradley repeated.  "You loved a man called An-Tak?"  "Yes," replied the girl.  "An-Tak was away, hunting, when the Wieroo caught me.  How he must have grieved for me!  He also was cos-ata-lu, twelve moons older than I, and all our lives we have been together."  Bradley remained silent.  So she loved An-Tak.  He hadn't the heart to tell her that An-Tak had died, or how.  At the door of Fosh-bal-soj's storeroom they halted to listen. No sound came from within, and gently Bradley pushed open the door. All was inky darkness as they entered; but presently their eyes became accustomed to the gloom that was partially relieved by the soft starlight without.  The Englishman searched and found those things for which he had come--two robes, two pairs of dead wings and several lengths of fiber rope.  One pair of the wings he adjusted to the girl's shoulders by means of the rope.  Then he draped the robe about her, carrying the cowl over her head.  He heard her gasp of astonishment when she realized the ingenuity and boldness of his plan; then he directed her to adjust the other pair of wings and the robe upon him.  Working with strong, deft fingers she soon had the work completed, and the two stepped out upon the roof, to all intent and purpose genuine Wieroos.  Besides his pistol Bradley carried the sword of the slain Wieroo prophet, while the girl was armed with the small blade of the red Wieroo.  Side by side they walked slowly across the roofs toward the north edge of the city.  Wieroos flapped above them and several times they passed others walking or sitting upon the roofs.  From the temple still rose the sounds of commotion, now pierced by occasional shrill screams.  "The murderers are abroad," whispered the girl.  "Thus will another become the tongue of Luata.  It is well for us, since it keeps them too busy to give the time for searching for us. They think that we cannot escape the city, and they know that we cannot leave the island--and so do I."  Bradley shook his head.  "If there is any way, we will find it," he said.  "There is no way," replied the girl.  Bradley made no response, and in silence they continued until the outer edge of roofs was visible before them.  "We are almost there," he whispered.  The girl felt for his fingers and pressed them.  He could feel hers trembling as he returned the pressure, nor did he relinquish her hand; and thus they came to the edge of the last roof.  Here they halted and looked about them.  To be seen attempting to descend to the ground below would be to betray the fact that they were not Wieroos.  Bradley wished that their wings were attached to their bodies by sinew and muscle rather than by ropes of fiber. A Wieroo was flapping far overhead.  Two more stood near a door a few yards distant.  Standing between these and one of the outer pedestals that supported one of the numerous skulls Bradley made one end of a piece of rope fast about the pedestal and dropped the other end to the ground outside the city.  Then they waited.  It was an hour before the coast was entirely clear and then a moment came when no Wieroo was in sight.  "Now!" whispered Bradley; and the girl grasped the rope and slid over the edge of the roof into the darkness below.  A moment later Bradley felt two quick pulls upon the rope and immediately followed to the girl's side.  Across a narrow clearing they made their way and into a wood beyond. All night they walked, following the river upward toward its source, and at dawn they took shelter in a thicket beside the stream.  At no time did they hear the cry of a carnivore, and though many startled animals fled as they approached, they were not once menaced by a wild beast.  When Bradley expressed surprise at the absence of the fiercest beasts that are so numerous upon the mainland of Caprona, the girl explained the reason that is contained in one of their ancient legends.  "When the Wieroos first developed wings upon which they could fly, they found this island devoid of any life other than a few reptiles that live either upon land or in the water and these only close to the coast.  Requiring meat for food the Wieroos carried to the island such animals as they wished for that purpose.  They still occasionally bring them, and this with the natural increase keeps them provided with flesh."  "As it will us," suggested Bradley.  The first day they remained in hiding, eating only the dried food that Bradley had brought with him from the temple storeroom, and the next night they set out again up the river, continuing steadily on until almost dawn, when they came to low hills where the river wound through a gorge--it was little more than rivulet now, the water clear and cold and filled with fish similar to brook trout though much larger.  Not wishing to leave the stream the two waded along its bed to a spot where the gorge widened between perpendicular bluffs to a wooded acre of level land. Here they stopped, for here also the stream ended.  They had reached its source--many cold springs bubbling up from the center of a little natural amphitheater in the hills and forming a clear and beautiful pool overshadowed by trees upon one side and bounded by a little clearing upon the other.  With the coming of the sun they saw they had stumbled upon a place where they might remain hidden from the Wieroos for a long time and also one that they could defend against these winged creatures, since the trees would shield them from an attack from above and also hamper the movements of the creatures should they attempt to follow them into the wood.  For three days they rested here before trying to explore the neighboring country.  On the fourth, Bradley stated that he was going to scale the bluffs and learn what lay beyond.  He told the girl that she should remain in hiding; but she refused to be left, saying that whatever fate was to be his, she intended to share it, so that he was at last forced to permit her to come with him.  Through woods at the summit of the bluff they made their way toward the north and had gone but a short distance when the wood ended and before them they saw the waters of the inland sea and dimly in the distance the coveted shore.  The beach lay some two hundred yards from the foot of the hill on which they stood, nor was there a tree nor any other form of shelter between them and the water as far up and down the coast as they could see.  Among other plans Bradley had thought of constructing a covered raft upon which they might drift to the mainland; but as such a contrivance would necessarily be of considerable weight, it must be built in the water of the sea, since they could not hope to move it even a short distance overland.  "If this wood was only at the edge of the water," he sighed.  "But it is not," the girl reminded him, and then:  "Let us make the best of it.  We have escaped from death for a time at least. We have food and good water and peace and each other.  What more could we have upon the mainland?"  "But I thought you wanted to get back to your own country!" he exclaimed.  She cast her eyes upon the ground and half turned away.  "I do," she said, "yet I am happy here.  I could be little happier there."  Bradley stood in silent thought.  "`We have food and good water and peace and each other!'" he repeated to himself.  He turned then and looked at the girl, and it was as though in the days that they had been together this was the first time that he had really seen her.  The circumstances that had thrown them together, the dangers through which they had passed, all the weird and horrible surroundings that had formed the background of his knowledge of her had had their effect--she had been but the companion of an adventure; her self-reliance, her endurance, her loyalty, had been only what one man might expect of another, and he saw that he had unconsciously assumed an attitude toward her that he might have assumed toward a man.  Yet there had been a difference--he recalled now the strange sensation of elation that had thrilled him upon the occasions when the girl had pressed his hand in hers, and the depression that had followed her announcement of her love for An-Tak.  He took a step toward her.  A fierce yearning to seize her and crush her in his arms, swept over him, and then there flashed upon the screen of recollection the picture of a stately hall set amidst broad gardens and ancient trees and of a proud old man with beetling brows--an old man who held his head very high--and Bradley shook his head and turned away again.  They went back then to their little acre, and the days came and went, and the man fashioned spear and bow and arrows and hunted with them that they might have meat, and he made hooks of fishbone and caught fishes with wondrous flies of his own invention; and the girl gathered fruits and cooked the flesh and the fish and made beds of branches and soft grasses. She cured the hides of the animals he killed and made them soft by much pounding.  She made sandals for herself and for the man and fashioned a hide after the manner of those worn by the warriors of her tribe and made the man wear it, for his own garments were in rags.  She was always the same--sweet and kind and helpful--but always there was about her manner and her expression just a trace of wistfulness, and often she sat and looked at the man when he did not know it, her brows puckered in thought as though she were trying to fathom and to understand him.  In the face of the cliff, Bradley scooped a cave from the rotted granite of which the hill was composed, making a shelter for them against the rains.  He brought wood for their cook-fire which they used only in the middle of the day--a time when there was little likelihood of Wieroos being in the air so far from their city--and then he learned to bank it with earth in such a way that the embers held until the following noon without giving off smoke.  Always he was planning on reaching the mainland, and never a day passed that he did not go to the top of the hill and look out across the sea toward the dark, distant line that meant for him comparative freedom and possibly reunion with his comrades. The girl always went with him, standing at his side and watching the stern expression on his face with just a tinge of sadness on her own.  "You are not happy," she said once.  "I should be over there with my men," he replied.  "I do not know what may have happened to them."  "I  want you to be happy," she said quite simply; "but I should be very lonely if you went away and left me here."  He put his hand on her shoulder.  "I would not do that, little girl," he said gently.  "If you cannot go with me, I shall not go. If either of us must go alone, it will be you."  Her face lighted to a wondrous smile.  "Then we shall not be separated," she said, "for I shall never leave you as long as we both live."  He looked down into her face for a moment and then:  "Who was An-Tak? " he asked.  "My brother," she replied.  "Why?"  And then, even less than before, could he tell her.  It was then that he did something he had never done before--he put his arms about her and stooping, kissed her forehead.  "Until you find An-Tak," he said, "I will be your brother."  She drew away.  "I already have a brother," she said, "and I do not want another."    Chapter 5   Days became weeks, and weeks became months, and the months followed one another in a lazy procession of hot, humid days and warm, humid nights.  The fugitives saw never a Wieroo by day though often at night they heard the melancholy flapping of giant wings far above them.  Each day was much like its predecessor.  Bradley splashed about for a few minutes in the cold pool early each morning and after a time the girl tried it and liked it.  Toward the center it was deep enough for swimming, and so he taught her to swim--she was probably the first human being in all Caspak's long ages who had done this thing.  And then while she prepared breakfast, the man shaved--this he never neglected.  At first it was a source of wonderment to the girl, for the Galu men are beardless.  When they needed meat, he hunted, otherwise he busied himself in improving their shelter, making new and better weapons, perfecting his knowledge of the girl's language and teaching her to speak and to write English--anything that would keep them both occupied.  He still sought new plans for escape, but with ever-lessening enthusiasm, since each new scheme presented some insurmountable obstacle.  And then one day as a bolt out of a clear sky came that which blasted the peace and security of their sanctuary forever. Bradley was just emerging from the water after his morning plunge when from overhead came the sound of flapping wings. Glancing quickly up the man saw a white-robed Wieroo circling slowly above him.  That he had been discovered he could not doubt since the creature even dropped to a lower altitude as though to assure itself that what it saw was a man.  Then it rose rapidly and winged away toward the city.  For two days Bradley and the girl lived in a constant state of apprehension, awaiting the moment when the hunters would come for them; but nothing happened until just after dawn of the third day, when the flapping of wings apprised them of the approach of Wieroos.  Together they went to the edge of the wood and looked up to see five red-robed creatures dropping slowly in ever-lessening spirals toward their little amphitheater.  With no attempt at concealment they came, sure of their ability to overwhelm these two fugitives, and with the fullest measure of self-confidence they landed in the clearing but a few yards from the man and the girl.  Following a plan already discussed Bradley and the girl retreated slowly into the woods.  The Wieroos advanced, calling upon them to give themselves up; but the quarry made no reply.  Farther and farther into the little wood Bradley led the hunters, permitting them to approach ever closer; then he circled back again toward the clearing, evidently to the great delight of the Wieroos, who now followed more leisurely, awaiting the moment when they should be beyond the trees and able to use their wings.  They had opened into semicircular formation now with the evident intention of cutting the two off from returning into the wood.  Each Wieroo advanced with his curved blade ready in his hand, each hideous face blank and expressionless.  It was then that Bradley opened fire with his pistol--three shots, aimed with careful deliberation, for it had been long since he had used the weapon, and he could not afford to chance wasting ammunition on misses.  At each shot a Wieroo dropped; and then the remaining two sought escape by flight, screaming and wailing after the manner of their kind.  When a Wieroo runs, his wings spread almost without any volition upon his part, since from time immemorial he has always used them to balance himself and accelerate his running speed so that in the open they appear to skim the surface of the ground when in the act of running. But here in the woods, among the close-set boles, the spreading of their wings proved their undoing--it hindered and stopped them and threw them to the ground, and then Bradley was upon them threatening them with instant death if they did not surrender-- promising them their freedom if they did his bidding.  "As you have seen," he cried, "I can kill you when I wish and at a distance.  You cannot escape me.  Your only hope of life lies in obedience.  Quick, or I kill!"  The Wieroos stopped and faced him.  "What do you want of us?" asked one.  "Throw aside your weapons," Bradley commanded.  After a moment's hesitation they obeyed.  "Now approach!"  A great plan--the only plan--had suddenly come to him like an inspiration.  The Wieroos came closer and halted at his command.  Bradley turned to the girl.  "There is rope in the shelter," he said.  "Fetch it!"  She did as he bid, and then he directed her to fasten one end of a fifty-foot length to the ankle of one of the Wieroos and the opposite end to the second.  The creatures gave evidence of great fear, but they dared not attempt to prevent the act.  "Now go out into the clearing," said Bradley, "and remember that I am walking close behind and that I will shoot the nearer one should either attempt to escape--that will hold the other until I can kill him as well."  In the open he halted them.  "The girl will get upon the back of the one in front," announced the Englishman.  "I will mount the other.  She carries a sharp blade, and I carry this weapon that you know kills easily at a distance.  If you disobey in the slightest, the instructions that I am about to give you, you shall both die.  That we must die with you, will not deter us. If you obey, I promise to set you free without harming you.  "You will carry us due west, depositing us upon the shore of the mainland--that is all.  It is the price of your lives.  Do you agree?"  Sullenly the Wieroos acquiesced.  Bradley examined the knots that held the rope to their ankles, and feeling them secure directed the girl to mount the back of the leading Wieroo, himself upon the other.  Then he gave the signal for the two to rise together. With loud flapping of the powerful wings the creatures took to the air, circling once before they topped the trees upon the hill and then taking a course due west out over the waters of the sea.  Nowhere about them could Bradley see signs of other Wieroos, nor of those other menaces which he had feared might bring disaster to his plans for escape--the huge, winged reptilia that are so numerous above the southern areas of Caspak and which are often seen, though in lesser numbers, farther north.  Nearer and nearer loomed the mainland--a broad, parklike expanse stretching inland to the foot of a low plateau spread out before them. The little dots in the foreground became grazing herds of deer and antelope and bos; a huge woolly rhinoceros wallowed in a mudhole to the right, and beyond, a mighty mammoth culled the tender shoots from a tall tree.  The roars and screams and growls of giant carnivora came faintly to their ears.  Ah, this was Caspak. With all of its dangers and its primal savagery it brought a fullness to the throat of the Englishman as to one who sees and hears the familiar sights and sounds of home after a long absence. Then the Wieroos dropped swiftly downward to the flower-starred turf that grew almost to the water's edge, the fugitives slipped from their backs, and Bradley told the red-robed creatures they were free to go.  When he had cut the ropes from their ankles they rose with that uncanny wailing upon their lips that always brought a shudder to the Englishman, and upon dismal wings they flapped away toward frightful Oo-oh.  When the creatures had gone, the girl turned toward Bradley. "Why did you have them bring us here?" she asked.  "Now we are far from my country.  We may never live to reach it, as we are among enemies who, while not so horrible will kill us just as surely as would the Wieroos should they capture us, and we have before us many marches through lands filled with savage beasts."  "There were two reasons," replied Bradley.  "You told me that there are two Wieroo cities at the eastern end of the island. To have passed near either of them might have been to have brought about our heads hundreds of the creatures from whom we could not possibly have escaped.  Again, my friends must be near this spot-- it cannot be over two marches to the fort of which I have told you. It is my duty to return to them.  If they still live we shall find a way to return you to your people."  "And you?" asked the girl.  "I escaped from Oo-oh," replied Bradley.  "I have accomplished the impossible once, and so I shall accomplish it again--I shall escape from Caspak."  He was not looking at her face as he answered her, and so he did not see the shadow of sorrow that crossed her countenance. When he raised his eyes again, she was smiling.  "What you wish, I wish," said the girl.  Southward along the coast they made their way following the beach, where the walking was best, but always keeping close enough to trees to insure sanctuary from the beasts and reptiles that so often menaced them.  It was late in the afternoon when the girl suddenly seized Bradley's arm and pointed straight ahead along the shore.  "What is that?" she whispered.  "What strange reptile is it?"  Bradley looked in the direction her slim forefinger indicated. He rubbed his eyes and looked again, and then he seized her wrist and drew her quickly behind a clump of bushes.  "What is it?" she asked.  "It is the most frightful reptile that the waters of the world have ever known," he replied.  "It is a German U-boat!"  An expression of amazement and understanding lighted her features. "It is the thing of which you told me," she exclaimed, "--the thing that swims under the water and carries men in its belly!"  "It is," replied Bradley.  "Then why do you hide from it?" asked the girl.  "You said that now it belonged to your friends."  "Many months have passed since I knew what was going on among my friends," he replied.  "I cannot know what has befallen them. They should have been gone from here in this vessel long since, and so I cannot understand why it is still here.  I am going to investigate first before I show myself.  When I left, there were more Germans on the U-33 than there were men of my own party at the fort, and I have had sufficient experience of Germans to know that they will bear watching--if they have not been properly watched since I left."  Making their way through a fringe of wood that grew a few yards inland the two crept unseen toward the U-boat which lay moored to the shore at a point which Bradley now recognized as being near the oil-pool north of Dinosaur.  As close as possible to the vessel they halted, crouching low among the dense vegetation, and watched the boat for signs of human life about it.  The hatches were closed--no one could be seen or heard.  For five minutes Bradley watched, and then he determined to board the submarine and investigate.  He had risen to carry his decision into effect when there suddenly broke upon his ear, uttered in loud and menacing tones, a volley of German oaths and expletives among which he heard Englische schweinhunde repeated several times. The voice did not come from the direction of the U-boat; but from inland.  Creeping forward Bradley reached a spot where, through the creepers hanging from the trees, he could see a party of men coming down toward the shore.  He saw Baron Friedrich von Schoenvorts and six of his men--all armed--while marching in a little knot among them were Olson, Brady, Sinclair, Wilson, and Whitely.  Bradley knew nothing of the disappearance of Bowen Tyler and Miss La Rue, nor of the perfidy of the Germans in shelling the fort and attempting to escape in the U-33; but he was in no way surprised at what he saw before him.  The little party came slowly onward, the prisoners staggering beneath heavy cans of oil, while Schwartz, one of the German noncommissioned officers cursed and beat them with a stick of wood, impartially.  Von Schoenvorts walked in the rear of the column, encouraging Schwartz and laughing at the discomfiture of the Britishers.  Dietz, Heinz, and Klatz also seemed to enjoy the entertainment immensely; but two of the men--Plesser and Hindle-- marched with eyes straight to the front and with scowling faces.  Bradley felt his blood boil at sight of the cowardly indignities being heaped upon his men, and in the brief span of time occupied by the column to come abreast of where he lay hidden he made his plans, foolhardy though he knew them.  Then he drew the girl close to him.  "Stay here," he whispered.  "I am going out to fight those beasts; but I shall be killed.  Do not let them see you.  Do not let them take you alive.  They are more cruel, more cowardly, more bestial than the Wieroos."  The girl pressed close to him, her face very white.  "Go, if that is right," she whispered; "but if you die, I shall die, for I cannot live without you."  He looked sharply into her eyes. "Oh!" he ejaculated.  "What an idiot I have been!  Nor could I live without you, little girl."  And he drew her very close and kissed her lips.  "Good-bye."  He disengaged himself from her arms and looked again in time to see that the rear of the column had just passed him.  Then he rose and leaped quickly and silently from the jungle.  Suddenly von Schoenvorts felt an arm thrown about his neck and his pistol jerked from its holster.  He gave a cry of fright and warning, and his men turned to see a half-naked white man holding their leader securely from behind and aiming a pistol at them over his shoulder.  "Drop those guns!" came in short, sharp syllables and perfect German from the lips of the newcomer.  "Drop them or I'll put a bullet through the back of von Schoenvorts' head."  The Germans hesitated for a moment, looking first toward von Schoenvorts and then to Schwartz, who was evidently second in command, for orders.  "It's the English pig, Bradley," shouted the latter, "and he's alone--go and get him!"  "Go yourself," growled Plesser.  Hindle moved close to the side of Plesser and whispered something to him.  The latter nodded. Suddenly von Schoenvorts wheeled about and seized Bradley's pistol arm with both hands, "Now!" he shouted.  "Come and take him, quick!"  Schwartz and three others leaped forward; but Plesser and Hindle held back, looking questioningly toward the English prisoners. Then Plesser spoke.  "Now is your chance, Englander," he called in low tones.  "Seize Hindle and me and take our guns from us--we will not fight hard."  Olson and Brady were not long in acting upon the suggestion. They had seen enough of the brutal treatment von Schoenvorts accorded his men and the especially venomous attentions he had taken great enjoyment in according Plesser and Hindle to understand that these two might be sincere in a desire for revenge.  In another moment the two Germans were unarmed and Olson and Brady were running to the support of Bradley; but already it seemed too late.  Von Schoenvorts had managed to drag the Englishman around so that his back was toward Schwartz and the other advancing Germans. Schwartz was almost upon Bradley with gun clubbed and ready to smash down upon the Englishman's skull.  Brady and Olson were charging the Germans in the rear with Wilson, Whitely, and Sinclair supporting them with bare fists.  It seemed that Bradley was doomed when, apparently out of space, an arrow whizzed, striking Schwartz in the side, passing half-way through his body to crumple him to earth.  With a shriek the man fell, and at the same time Olson and Brady saw the slim figure of a young girl standing at the edge of the jungle coolly fitting another arrow to her bow.  Bradley had now succeeded in wrestling his arm free from von Schoenvorts' grip and in dropping the latter with a blow from the butt of his pistol.  The rest of the English and Germans were engaged in a hand-to-hand encounter.  Plesser and Hindle standing aside from the melee and urging their comrades to surrender and join with the English against the tyranny of von Schoenvorts. Heinz and Klatz, possibly influenced by their exhortation, were putting up but a half-hearted resistance; but Dietz, a huge, bearded, bull-necked Prussian, yelling like a maniac, sought to exterminate the Englische schweinhunde with his bayonet, fearing to fire his piece lest he kill some of his comrades.  It was Olson who engaged him, and though unused to the long German rifle and bayonet, he met the bull-rush of the Hun with the cold, cruel precision and science of English bayonet-fighting. There was no feinting, no retiring and no parrying that was not also an attack.  Bayonet-fighting today is not a pretty thing to see--it is not an artistic fencing-match in which men give and take--it is slaughter inevitable and quickly over.  Dietz lunged once madly at Olson's throat.  A short point, with just a twist of the bayonet to the left sent the sharp blade over the Englishman's left shoulder.  Instantly he stepped close in, dropped his rifle through his hands and grasped it with both hands close below the muzzle and with a short, sharp jab sent his blade up beneath Dietz's chin to the brain.  So quickly was the thing done and so quick the withdrawal that Olson had wheeled to take on another adversary before the German's corpse had toppled to the ground.  But there were no more adversaries to take on.  Heinz and Klatz had thrown down their rifles and with hands above their heads were crying "Kamerad!  Kamerad!" at the tops of their voices. Von Schoenvorts still lay where he had fallen.  Plesser and Hindle were explaining to Bradley that they were glad of the outcome of the fight, as they could no longer endure the brutality of the U-boat commander.  The remainder of the men were looking at the girl who now advanced slowly, her bow ready, when Bradley turned toward her and held out his hand.  "Co-Tan," he said, "unstring your bow--these are my friends, and yours."  And to the Englishmen:  "This is Co-Tan.  You who saw her save me from Schwartz know a part of what I owe her."  The rough men gathered about the girl, and when she spoke to them in broken English, with a smile upon her lips enhancing the charm of her irresistible accent, each and every one of them promptly fell in love with her and constituted himself henceforth her guardian and her slave.  A moment later the attention of each was called to Plesser by a volley of invective.  They turned in time to see the man running toward von Schoenvorts who was just rising from the ground. Plesser carried a rifle with bayonet fixed, that he had snatched from the side of Dietz's corpse.  Von Schoenvorts' face was livid with fear, his jaws working as though he would call for help; but no sound came from his blue lips.  "You struck me," shrieked Plesser.  "Once, twice, three times, you struck me, pig.  You murdered Schwerke--you drove him insane by your cruelty until he took his own life.  You are only one of your kind--they are all like you from the Kaiser down.  I wish that you were the Kaiser.  Thus would I do!"  And he lunged his bayonet through von Schoenvorts' chest.  Then he let his rifle fall with the dying man and wheeled toward Bradley.  "Here I am," he said.  "Do with me as you like.  All my life I have been kicked and cuffed by such as that, and yet always have I gone out when they commanded, singing, to give up my life if need be to keep them in power.  Only lately have I come to know what a fool I have been.  But now I am no longer a fool, and besides, I am avenged and Schwerke is avenged, so you can kill me if you wish. Here I am."  "If I was after bein' the king," said Olson, "I'd pin the V.C. on your noble chist; but bein' only an Irishman with a Swede name, for which God forgive me, the bist I can do is shake your hand."  "You will not be punished," said Bradley.  "There are four of you left--if you four want to come along and work with us, we will take you; but you will come as prisoners."  "It suits me," said Plesser.  "Now that the captain-lieutenant is dead you need not fear us.  All our lives we have known nothing but to obey his class.  If I had not killed him, I suppose I would be fool enough to obey him again; but he is dead.  Now we will obey you--we must obey some one."  "And you?"  Bradley turned to the other survivors of the original crew of the U-33.  Each promised obedience.  The two dead Germans were buried in a single grave, and then the party boarded the submarine and stowed away the oil.  Here Bradley told the men what had befallen him since the night of September 14th when he had disappeared so mysteriously from the camp upon the plateau.  Now he learned for the first time that Bowen J. Tyler, Jr., and Miss La Rue had been missing even longer than he and that no faintest trace of them had been discovered.  Olson told him of how the Germans had returned and waited in ambush for them outside the fort, capturing them that they might be used to assist in the work of refining the oil and later in manning the U-33, and Plesser told briefly of the experiences of the German crew under von Schoenvorts since they had escaped from Caspak months before--of how they lost their bearings after having been shelled by ships they had attempted to sneak farther north and how at last with provisions gone and fuel almost exhausted they had sought and at last found, more by accident than design, the mysterious island they had once been so glad to leave behind.  "Now," announced Bradley, "we'll plan for the future.  The boat has fuel, provisions and water for a month, I believe you said, Plesser; there are ten of us to man it.  We have a last sad duty here--we must search for Miss La Rue and Mr. Tyler.  I say a sad duty because we know that we shall not find them; but it is none the less our duty to comb the shoreline, firing signal shells at intervals, that we at least may leave at last with full knowledge that we have done all that men might do to locate them."  None dissented from this conviction, nor was there a voice raised in protest against the plan to at least make assurance doubly sure before quitting Caspak forever.  And so they started, cruising slowly up the coast and firing an occasional shot from the gun.  Often the vessel was brought to a stop, and always there were anxious eyes scanning the shore for an answering signal.  Late in the afternoon they caught sight of a number of Band-lu warriors; but when the vessel approached the shore and the natives realized that human beings stood upon the back of the strange monster of the sea, they fled in terror before Bradley could come within hailing distance.  That night they dropped anchor at the mouth of a sluggish stream whose warm waters swarmed with millions of tiny tadpolelike organisms--minute human spawn starting on their precarious journey from some inland pool toward "the beginning"--a journey which one in millions, perhaps, might survive to complete. Already almost at the inception of life they were being greeted by thousands of voracious mouths as fish and reptiles of many kinds fought to devour them, the while other and larger creatures pursued the devourers, to be, in turn, preyed upon by some other of the countless forms that inhabit the deeps of Caprona's frightful sea.  The second day was practically a repetition of the first. They moved very slowly with frequent stops and once they landed in the Kro-lu country to hunt.  Here they were attacked by the bow-and-arrow men, whom they could not persuade to palaver with them.  So belligerent were the natives that it became necessary to fire into them in order to escape their persistent and ferocious attentions.  "What chance," asked Bradley, as they were returning to the boat with their game, "could Tyler and Miss La Rue have had among such as these?"  But they continued on their fruitless quest, and the third day, after cruising along the shore of a deep inlet, they passed a line of lofty cliffs that formed the southern shore of the inlet and rounded a sharp promontory about noon.  Co-Tan and Bradley were on deck alone, and as the new shoreline appeared beyond the point, the girl gave an exclamation of joy and seized the man's hand in hers.  "Oh, look!" she cried.  "The Galu country!  The Galu country! It is my country that I never thought to see again."  "You are glad to come again, Co-Tan?" asked Bradley.  "Oh, so glad!" she cried.  "And you will come with me to my people? We may live here among them, and you will be a great warrior--oh, when Jor dies you may even be chief, for there is none so mighty as my warrior.  You will come?"  Bradley shook his head.  "I cannot, little Co-Tan," he answered. "My country needs me, and I must go back.  Maybe someday I shall return.  You will not forget me, Co-Tan?"  She looked at him in wide-eyed wonder.  "You are going away from me?" she asked in a very small voice.  "You are going away from Co-Tan?"  Bradley looked down upon the little bowed head.  He felt the soft cheek against his bare arm; and he felt something else there too-- hot drops of moisture that ran down to his very finger-tips and splashed, but each one wrung from a woman's heart.  He bent low and raised the tear-stained face to his own. "No, Co-Tan," he said, "I am not going away from you--for you are going with me.  You are going back to my own country to be my wife.  Tell me that you will, Co-Tan."  And he bent still lower yet from his height and kissed her lips.  Nor did he need more than the wonderful new light in her eyes to tell him that she would go to the end of the world with him if he would but take her. And then the gun-crew came up from below again to fire a signal shot, and the two were brought down from the high heaven of their new happiness to the scarred and weather-beaten deck of the U-33.  An hour later the vessel was running close in by a shore of wondrous beauty beside a parklike meadow that stretched back a mile inland to the foot of a plateau when Whitely called attention to a score of figures clambering downward from the elevation to the lowland below.  The engines were reversed and the boat brought to a stop while all hands gathered on deck to watch the little party coming toward them across the meadow.  "They are Galus," cried Co-Tan; "they are my own people.  Let me speak to them lest they think we come to fight them.  Put me ashore, my man, and I will go meet them."  The nose of the U-boat was run close in to the steep bank; but when Co-Tan would have run forward alone, Bradley seized her hand and held her back.  "I will go with you, Co-Tan," he said; and together they advanced to meet the oncoming party.  There were about twenty warriors moving forward in a thin line, as our infantry advance as skirmishers.  Bradley could not but notice the marked difference between this formation and the moblike methods of the lower tribes he had come in contact with, and he commented upon it to Co-Tan.  "Galu warriors always advance into battle thus," she said. "The lesser people remain in a huddled group where they can scarce use their weapons the while they present so big a mark to us that our spears and arrows cannot miss them; but when they hurl theirs at our warriors, if they miss the first man, there is no chance that they will kill some one behind him.  "Stand still now," she cautioned, "and fold your arms.  They will not harm us then."  Bradley did as he was bid, and the two stood with arms folded as the line of warriors approached.  When they had come within some fifty yards, they halted and one spoke.  "Who are you and from whence do you come?" he asked; and then Co-Tan gave a little, glad cry and sprang forward with out-stretched arms.  "Oh, Tan!" she exclaimed.  "Do you not know your little Co-Tan?"  The warrior stared, incredulous, for a moment, and then he, too, ran forward and when they met, took the girl in his arms.  It was then that Bradley experienced to the full a sensation that was new to him--a sudden hatred for the strange warrior before him and a desire to kill without knowing why he would kill.  He moved quickly to the girl's side and grasped her wrist.  "Who is this man?" he demanded in cold tones.  Co-Tan turned a surprised face toward the Englishman and then of a sudden broke forth into a merry peal of laughter.  "This is my father, Brad-lee," she cried.  "And who is Brad-lee?" demanded the warrior.  "He is my man," replied Co-Tan simply.  "By what right?" insisted Tan.  And then she told him briefly of all that she had passed through since the Wieroos had stolen her and of how Bradley had rescued her and sought to rescue An-Tak, her brother.  "You are satisfied with him?" asked Tan.  "Yes," replied the girl proudly.  It was then that Bradley's attention was attracted to the edge of the plateau by a movement there, and looking closely he saw a horse bearing two figures sliding down the steep declivity. Once at the bottom, the animal came charging across the meadowland at a rapid run.  It was a magnificent animal--a great bay stallion with a white-blazed face and white forelegs to the knees, its barrel encircled by a broad surcingle of white; and as it came to a sudden stop beside Tan, the Englishman saw that it bore a man and a girl--a tall man and a girl as beautiful as Co-Tan.  When the girl espied the latter, she slid from the horse and ran toward her, fairly screaming for joy.  The man dismounted and stood beside Tan.  Like Bradley he was garbed after the fashion of the surrounding warriors; but there was a subtle difference between him and his companion. Possibly he detected a similar difference in Bradley, for his first question was, "From what country?" and though he spoke in Galu Bradley thought he detected an accent.  "England," replied Bradley.  A broad smile lighted the newcomer's face as he held out his hand. "I am Tom Billings of Santa Monica, California," he said.  "I know all about you, and I'm mighty glad to find you alive."  "How did you get here?" asked Bradley.  "I thought ours was the only party of men from the outer world ever to enter Caprona."  "It was, until we came in search of Bowen J. Tyler, Jr.," replied Billings.  "We  found him and sent him home with his bride; but I was kept a prisoner here."  Bradley's face darkened--then they were not among friends after all.  "There are ten of us down there on a German sub with small-arms and a gun," he said quickly in English. "It will be no trick to get away from these people."  "You don't know my jailer," replied Billings, "or you'd not be so sure.  Wait, I'll introduce you."  And then turning to the girl who had accompanied him he called her by name.  "Ajor," he said, "permit me to introduce Lieutenant Bradley; Lieutenant, Mrs. Billings--my jailer!"  The Englishman laughed as he shook hands with the girl.  "You are not as good a soldier as I," he said to Billings.  "Instead of being taken prisoner myself I have taken one--Mrs. Bradley, this is Mr. Billings."  Ajor, quick to understand, turned toward Co-Tan.  "You are going back with him to his country?" she asked.  Co-Tan admitted it.  "You dare?" asked Ajor.  "But your father will not permit it-- Jor, my father, High Chief of the Galus, will not permit it, for like me you are cos-ata-lo.  Oh, Co-Tan, if we but could! How I would love to see all the strange and wonderful things of which my Tom tells me!"  Bradley bent and whispered in her ear.  "Say the word and you may both go with us."  Billings heard and speaking in English, asked Ajor if she would go.  "Yes," she answered, "If you wish it; but you know, my Tom, that if Jor captures us, both you and Co-Tan's man will pay the penalty with your lives--not even his love for me nor his admiration for you can save you."  Bradley noticed that she spoke in English--broken English like Co-Tan's but equally appealing.  "We can easily get you aboard the ship," he said, "on some pretext or other, and then we can steam away.  They can neither harm nor detain us, nor will we have to fire a shot at them."  And so it was done, Bradley and Co-Tan taking Ajor and Billings aboard to "show" them the vessel, which almost immediately raised anchor and moved slowly out into the sea.  "I hate to do it," said Billings.  "They have been fine to me. Jor and Tan are splendid men and they will think me an ingrate; but I can't waste my life here when there is so much to be done in the outer world."  As they steamed down the inland sea past the island of Oo-oh, the stories of their adventures were retold, and Bradley learned that Bowen Tyler and his bride had left the Galu country but a fortnight before and that there was every reason to believe that the Toreador might still be lying in the Pacific not far off the subterranean mouth of the river which emitted Caprona's heated waters into the ocean.  Late in the second day, after running through swarms of hideous reptiles, they submerged at the point where the river entered beneath the cliffs and shortly after rose to the sunlit surface of the Pacific; but nowhere as far as they could see was sign of another craft.  Down the coast they steamed toward the beach where Billings had made his crossing in the hydro-aeroplane and just at dusk the lookout announced a light dead ahead.  It proved to be aboard the Toreador, and a half-hour later there was such a reunion on the deck of the trig little yacht as no one there had ever dreamed might be possible.  Of the Allies there were only Tippet and James to be mourned, and no one mourned any of the Germans dead nor Benson, the traitor, whose ugly story was first told in Bowen Tyler's manuscript.  Tyler and the rescue party had but just reached the yacht that afternoon.  They had heard, faintly, the signal shots fired by the U-33 but had been unable to locate their direction and so had assumed that they had come from the guns of the Toreador.  It was a happy party that sailed north toward sunny, southern California, the old U-33 trailing in the wake of the Toreador and flying with the latter the glorious Stars and Stripes beneath which she had been born in the shipyard at Santa Monica. Three newly married couples, their bonds now duly solemnized by the master of the ship, joyed in the peace and security of the untracked waters of the south Pacific and the unique honeymoon which, had it not been for stern duty ahead, they could have wished protracted till the end of time.  And so they came one day to dock at the shipyard which Bowen Tyler now controlled, and here the U-33 still lies while those who passed so many eventful days within and because of her, have gone their various ways. Chapter 1  THE SEANCE  On a march evening, at eight o'clock, Backhouse, the medium--a fast-rising star in the psychic world--was ushered into the study at Prolands, the Hampstead residence of Montague Faull.  The room was illuminated only by the light of a blazing fire.  The host, eying him with indolent curiosity, got up, and the usual conventional greetings were exchanged.  Having indicated an easy chair before the fire to his guest, the South American merchant sank back again into his own. The electric light was switched on.  Faull's prominent, clear-cut features, metallic-looking skin, and general air of bored impassiveness, did not seem greatly to impress the medium, who was accustomed to regard men from a special angle.  Backhouse, on the contrary, was a novelty to the merchant.  As he tranquilly studied him through half closed lids and the smoke of a cigar, he wondered how this little, thickset person with the pointed beard contrived to remain so fresh and sane in appearance, in view of the morbid nature of his occupation.  "Do you smoke?" drawled Faull, by way of starting the Conversation. "No?  Then will you take a drink?"  "Not at present, I thank you."  A pause.  "Everything is satisfactory?  The materialisation will take place?"  "I see no reason to doubt it."  "That's good, for I would not like my guests to be disappointed.  I have your check written out in my pocket."  "Afterward will do quite well."  "Nine o'clock was the time specified, I believe?"  "I fancy so."  The conversation continued to flag.  Faull sprawled in his chair, and remained apathetic.  "Would you care to hear what arrangements I have made?"  "I am unaware that any are necessary, beyond chairs for your guests."  "I mean the decoration of the seance room, the music, and so forth."  Backhouse stared at his host.  "But this is not a theatrical performance."  "That's correct.  Perhaps I ought to explain....  There will be ladies present, and ladies, you know, are aesthetically inclined."  "In that case I have no objection.  I only hope they will enjoy the performance to the end."  He spoke rather dryly.  "Well, that's all right, then," said Faull.  Flicking his cigar into the fire, he got up and helped himself to whisky.  "Will you come and see the room?"  "Thank you, no. I prefer to have nothing to do with it till the time arrives."  "Then let's go to see my sister, Mrs. Jameson, who is in the drawing room.  She sometimes does me the kindness to act as my hostess, as I am unmarried."  "I will be delighted," said Backhouse coldly.  They found the lady alone, sitting by the open pianoforte in a pensive attitude.  She had been playing Scriabin and was overcome. The medium took in her small, tight, patrician features and porcelain- like hands, and wondered how Faull came by such a sister.  She received him bravely, with just a shade of quiet emotion.  He was used to such receptions at the hands of the sex, and knew well how to respond to them.  "What amazes me," she half whispered, after ten minutes of graceful, hollow conversation, "is, if you must know it, not so much the manifestation itself--though that will surely be wonderful--as your assurance that it will take place.  Tell me the grounds of your confidence."  "I dream with open eyes," he answered, looking around at the door, "and others see my dreams.  That is all."  "But that's beautiful," responded Mrs. Jameson.  She smiled rather absently, for the first guest had just entered.  It was Kent-Smith, the ex-magistrate, celebrated for his shrewd judicial humour, which, however, he had the good sense not to attempt to carry into private life.  Although well on the wrong side of seventy, his eyes were still disconcertingly bright.  With the selective skill of an old man, he immediately settled himself in the most comfortable of many comfortable chairs.  "So we are to see wonders tonight?"  "Fresh material for your autobiography," remarked Faull.  "Ah, you should not have mentioned my unfortunate book.  An old public servant is merely amusing himself in his retirement, Mr. Backhouse.  You have no cause for alarm--I have studied in the school of discretion."  "I am not alarmed.  There can be no possible objection to your publishing whatever you please."  "You are most kind," said the old man, with a cunning smile.  "Trent is not coming tonight," remarked Mrs. Jameson, throwing a curious little glance at her brother.  "I never thought he would.  It's not in his line."  "Mrs. Trent, you must understand," she went on, addressing the ex- magistrate, "has placed us all under a debt of gratitude.  She has decorated the old lounge hall upstairs most beautifully, and has secured the services of the sweetest little orchestra."  "But this is Roman magnificence."  "Backhouse thinks the spirits should be treated with more deference," laughed Faull.  "Surely, Mr. Backhouse--a poetic environment..."  "Pardon me.  I am a simple man, and always prefer to reduce things to elemental simplicity.  I raise no opposition, but I express my opinion.  Nature is one thing, and art is another."  "And I am not sure that I don't agree with you," said the ex- magistrate.  "An occasion like this ought to be simple, to guard against the possibility of deception--if you will forgive my bluntness, Mr. Backhouse."  "We shall sit in full light," replied Backhouse, "and every opportunity will be given to all to inspect the room.  I shall also ask you to submit me to a personal examination."  A rather embarrassed silence followed.  It was broken by the arrival of two more guests, who entered together.  These were Prior, the prosperous City coffee importer, and Lang, the stockjobber, well known in his own circle as an amateur prestidigitator.  Backhouse was slightly acquainted with the latter.  Prior, perfuming the room with the faint odour of wine and tobacco smoke, tried to introduce an atmosphere of joviality into the proceedings.  Finding that no one seconded his efforts, however, he shortly subsided and fell to examining the water colours on the walls.  Lang, tall, thin, and growing bald, said little, but stared at Backhouse a good deal.  Coffee, liqueurs, and cigarettes were now brought in.  Everyone partook, except Lang and the medium.  At the same moment, Professor Halbert was announced.  He was the eminent psychologist, the author and lecturer on crime, insanity, genius, and so forth, considered in their mental aspects.  His presence at such a gathering somewhat mystified the other guests, but all felt as if the object of their meeting had immediately acquired additional solemnity.  He was small, meagre-looking, and mild in manner, but was probably the most stubborn-brained of all that mixed company.  Completely ignoring the medium, he at once sat down beside Kent-Smith, with whom he began to exchange remarks.  At a few minutes past the appointed hour Mrs. Trent entered, unannounced.  She was a woman of about twenty-eight.  She had a white, demure, saintlike face, smooth black hair, and lips so crimson and full that they seemed to be bursting with blood.  Her tall, graceful body was most expensively attired.  Kisses were exchanged between her and Mrs. Jameson.  She bowed to the rest of the assembly, and stole a half glance and a smile at Faull.  The latter gave her a queer look, and Backhouse, who lost nothing, saw the concealed barbarian in the complacent gleam of his eye.  She refused the refreshment that was offered her, and Faull proposed that, as everyone had now arrived, they should adjourn to the lounge hall.  Mrs. Trent held up a slender palm.  "Did you, or did you not, give me carte blanche, Montague?"  "Of course I did," said Faull, laughing.  "But what's the matter?"  "Perhaps I have been rather presumptuous.  I don't know.  I have invited a couple of friends to join us.  No, no one knows them.... The two most extraordinary individuals you ever saw.  And mediums, I am sure."  "It sounds very mysterious.  Who are these conspirators?"  "At least tell us their names, you provoking girl," put in Mrs. Jameson.  "One rejoices in the name of Maskull, and the other in that of Nightspore.  That's nearly all that I know about them, so don't overwhelm me with, any more questions."  "But where did you pick them up?  You must have picked them up somewhere."  "But this is a cross-examination.  Have I sinned again convention? I swear I will tell you not another word about them.  They will be here directly, and then I will deliver them to your tender mercy."  "I don't know them," said Faull, "and nobody else seems to, but, of course, we will all be very pleased to have them....  Shall we wait, or what?"  "I said nine, and it's past that now.  It's quite possible they may not turn up after all....  Anyway, don't wait."  "I would prefer to start at once," said Backhouse.  The lounge, a lofty room, forty feet long by twenty wide, had been divided for the occasion into two equal parts by a heavy brocade curtain drawn across the middle.  The far end was thus concealed. The nearer half had been converted into an auditorium by a crescent of armchairs.  There was no other furniture.  A large fire was burning halfway along the wall, between the chairbacks and the door.  The room was brilliantly lighted by electric bracket lamps.  A sumptuous carpet covered the floor.  Having settled his guests in their seats, Faull stepped up to the curtain and flung it aside.  A replica, or nearly so, of the Drury Lane presentation of the temple scene in The Magic Flute was then exposed to view: the gloomy, massive architecture of the interior, the glowing sky above it in the background, and, silhouetted against the latter, the gigantic seated statue of the Pharaoh.  A fantastically carved wooden couch lay before the pedestal of the statue.  Near the curtain, obliquely placed to the auditorium, was a plain oak armchair, for the use of the medium.  Many of those present felt privately that the setting was quite inappropriate to the occasion and savoured rather unpleasantly of ostentation.  Backhouse in particular seemed put out.  The usual compliments, however, were showered on Mrs. Trent as the deviser of so remarkable a theatre.  Faull invited his friends to step forward and examine the apartment as minutely as they might desire.  Prior and Lang were the only ones to accept.  The former wandered about among the pasteboard scenery, whistling to himself and occasionally tapping a part of it with his knuckles.  Lang, who was in his element, ignored the rest of his party and commenced a patient, systematic search, on his own account, for secret apparatus.  Faull and Mrs. Trent stood in a corner of the temple, talking together in low tones; while Mrs. Jameson, pretending to hold Backhouse in conversation, watched them as only a deeply interested woman knows how to watch.  Lang, to his own disgust, having failed to find anything of a suspicious nature, the medium now requested that his own clothing should be searched.  "All these precautions are quite needless and beside the matter in hand, as you will immediately see for yourselves.  My reputation demands, however, that other people who are not present would not be able to say afterward that trickery has been resorted to."  To Lang again fell the ungrateful task of investigating pockets and sleeves.  Within a few minutes he expressed himself satisfied that nothing mechanical was in Backhouse's possession.  The guests reseated themselves.  Faull ordered two more chairs to be brought for Mrs. Trent's friends, who, however, had not yet arrived.  He then pressed an electric bell, and took his own seat.  The signal was for the hidden orchestra to begin playing.  A murmur of surprise passed through the audience as, without previous warning, the beautiful and solemn strains of Mozart's "temple" music pulsated through the air.  The expectation of everyone was raised, while, beneath her pallor and composure, it could be seen that Mrs. Trent was deeply moved.  It was evident that aesthetically she was by far the most important person present.  Faull watched her, with his face sunk on his chest, sprawling as usual.  Backhouse stood up, with one hand on the back of his chair, and began speaking.  The music instantly sank to pianissimo, and remained so for as long as he was on his legs.  "Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a materialisation. That means you will see something appear in space that was not previously there.  At first it will appear as a vaporous form, but finally it will be a solid body, which anyone present may feel and handle--and, for example, shake hands with.  For this body will be in the human shape.  It will be a real man or woman--which, I can't say--but a man or woman without known antecedents.  If, however, you demand from me an explanation of the origin of this materialised form--where it comes from, whence the atoms and molecules composing its tissues are derived--I am unable to satisfy you.  I am about to produce the phenomenon; if anyone can explain it to me afterward, I shall be very grateful....  That is all I have to say."  He resumed his seat, half turning his back on the assembly, and paused for a moment before beginning his task.  It was precisely at this minute that the manservant opened the door and announced in a subdued but distinct voice: "Mr. Maskull, Mr. Nightspore."  Everyone turned round.  Faull rose to welcome the late arrivals. Backhouse also stood up, and stared hard at them.  The two strangers remained standing by the door, which was closed quietly behind them.  They seemed to be waiting for the mild sensation caused by their appearance to subside before advancing into the room.  Maskull was a kind of giant, but of broader and more robust physique than most giants.  He wore a full beard.  His features were thick and heavy, coarsely modelled, like those of a wooden carving; but his eyes, small and black, sparkled with the fires of intelligence and audacity.  His hair was short, black, and bristling.  Nightspore was of middle height, but so tough-looking that he appeared to be trained out of all human frailties and susceptibilities.  His hairless face seemed consumed by an intense spiritual hunger, and his eyes were wild and distant.  Both men were dressed in tweeds.  Before any words were spoken, a loud and terrible crash of falling masonry caused the assembled party to start up from their chairs in consternation.  It sounded as if the entire upper part of the building had collapsed.  Faull sprang to the door, and called to the servant to say what was happening.  The man had to be questioned twice before he gathered what was required of him.  He said he had heard nothing.  In obedience to his master's order, he went upstairs. Nothing, however, was amiss there, neither had the maids heard anything.  In the meantime Backhouse, who almost alone of those assembled had preserved his sangfroid, went straight up to Nightspore, who stood gnawing his nails.  "Perhaps you can explain it, sir?"  "It was supernatural," said Nightspore, in a harsh, muffled voice, turning away from his questioner.  "I guessed so.  It is a familiar phenomenon, but I have never heard it so loud."  He then went among the guests, reassuring them.  By degrees they settled down, but it was observable that their former easy and good- humoured interest in the proceedings was now changed to strained watchfulness.  Maskull and Nightspore took the places allotted to them.  Mrs. Trent kept stealing uneasy glances at them.  Throughout the entire incident, Mozart's hymn continued to be played.  The orchestra also had heard nothing.  Backhouse now entered on his task.  It was one that began to be familiar to him, and he had no anxiety about the result.  It was not possible to effect the materialisation by mere concentration of will, or the exercise of any faculty; otherwise many people could have done what he had engaged himself to do.  His nature was phenomenal--the dividing wall between himself and the spiritual world was broken in many places.  Through the gaps in his mind the inhabitants of the invisible, when he summoned them, passed for a moment timidly and awfully into the solid, coloured universe....  He could not say how it was brought about....  The experience was a rough one for the body, and many such struggles would lead to insanity and early death.  That is why Backhouse was stern and abrupt in his manner.  The coarse, clumsy suspicion of some of the witnesses, the frivolous aestheticism of others, were equally obnoxious to his grim, bursting heart; but he was obliged to live, and, to pay his way, must put up with these impertinences.  He sat down facing the wooden couch.  His eyes remained open but seemed to look inward.  His cheeks paled, and he became noticeably thinner.  The spectators almost forgot to breathe.  The more sensitive among them began to feel, or imagine, strange presences all around them.  Maskull's eyes glittered with anticipation, and his brows went up and down, but Nightspore appeared bored.  After a long ten minutes the pedestal of the statue was seen to become slightly blurred, as though an intervening mist were rising from the ground.  This slowly developed into a visible cloud, coiling hither and thither, and constantly changing shape.  The professor half rose, and held his glasses with one hand further forward on the bridge of his nose.  By slow stages the cloud acquired the dimensions and approximate outline of an adult human body, although all was still vague and blurred.  It hovered lightly in the air, a foot or so above the couch.  Backhouse looked haggard and ghastly.  Mrs. Jameson quietly fainted in her chair, but she was unnoticed, and presently revived. The apparition now settled down upon the couch, and at the moment of doing so seemed suddenly to grow dark, solid, and manlike.  Many of the guests were as pale as the medium himself, but Faull preserved his stoical apathy, and glanced once or twice at Mrs. Trent.  She was staring straight at the couch, and was twisting a little lace handkerchief through the different fingers of her hand.  The music went on playing.  The figure was by this time unmistakably that of a man lying down. The face focused itself into distinctness.  The body was draped in a sort of shroud, but the features were those of a young man.  One smooth hand fell over, nearly touching the floor, white and motionless.  The weaker spirits of the company stared at the vision in sick horror; the rest were grave and perplexed.  The seeming man was dead, but somehow it did not appear like a death succeeding life, but like a death preliminary to life.  All felt that he might sit up at any minute.  "Stop that music!" muttered Backhouse, tottering from his chair and facing the party.  Faull touched the bell.  A few more bars sounded, and then total silence ensued.  "Anyone who wants to may approach the couch," said Backhouse with difficulty.  Lang at once advanced, and stared awestruck at the supernatural youth.  "You are at liberty to touch," said the medium.  But Lang did not venture to, nor did any of the others, who one by one stole up to the couch--until it came to Faull's turn.  He looked straight at Mrs. Trent, who seemed frightened and disgusted at the spectacle before her, and then not only touched the apparition but suddenly grasped the drooping hand in his own and gave it a powerful squeeze.  Mrs. Trent gave a low scream.  The ghostly visitor opened his eyes, looked at Faull strangely, and sat up on the couch.  A cryptic smile started playing over his mouth.  Faull looked at his hand; a feeling of intense pleasure passed through his body.  Maskull caught Mrs. Jameson in his arms; she was attacked by another spell of faintness.  Mrs. Trent ran forward, and led her out of the room.  Neither of them returned.  The phantom body now stood upright, looking about him, still with his peculiar smile.  Prior suddenly felt sick, and went out.  The other men more or less hung together, for the sake of human society, but Nightspore paced up and down, like a man weary and impatient, while Maskull attempted to interrogate the youth.  The apparition watched him with a baffling expression, but did not answer.  Backhouse was sitting apart, his face buried in his hands.  It was at this moment that the door was burst open violently, and a stranger, unannounced, half leaped, half strode a few yards into the room, and then stopped.  None of Faull's friends had ever seen him before.  He was a thick, shortish man, with surprising muscular development and a head far too large in proportion to his body.  His beardless yellow face indicated, as a first impression, a mixture of sagacity, brutality, and humour.  "Aha-i, gentlemen!" he called out loudly.  His voice was piercing, and oddly disagreeable to the ear.  "So we have a little visitor here."  Nightspore turned his back, but everyone else stared at the intruder in astonishment.  He took another few steps forward, which brought him to the edge of the theatre.  "May I ask, sir, how I come to have the honour of being your host?" asked Faull sullenly.  He thought that the evening was not proceeding as smoothly as he had anticipated.  The newcomer looked at him for a second, and then broke into a great, roaring guffaw.  He thumped Faull on the back playfully--but the play was rather rough, for the victim was sent staggering against the wall before he could recover his balance.  "Good evening, my host!"  "And good evening to you too, my lad!" he went on, addressing the supernatural youth, who was now beginning to wander about the room, in apparent unconsciousness of his surroundings.  "I have seen someone very like you before, I think."  There was no response.  The intruder thrust his head almost up to the phantom's face.  "You have no right here, as you know."  The shape looked back at him with a smile full of significance, which, however, no one could understand.  "Be careful what you are doing," said Backhouse quickly.  "What's the matter, spirit usher?"  "I don't know who you are, but if you use physical violence toward that, as you seem inclined to do, the consequences may prove very unpleasant."  "And without pleasure our evening would be spoiled, wouldn't it, my little mercenary friend?"  Humour vanished from his face, like sunlight from a landscape, leaving it hard and rocky.  Before anyone realised what he was doing, he encircled the soft, white neck of the materialised shape with his hairy hands and, with a double turn, twisted it completely round.  A faint, unearthly shriek sounded, and the body fell in a heap to the floor.  Its face was uppermost.  The guests were unutterably shocked to observe that its expression had changed from the mysterious but fascinating smile to a vulgar, sordid, bestial grin, which cast a cold shadow of moral nastiness into every heart.  The transformation was accompanied by a sickening stench of the graveyard.  The features faded rapidly away, the body lost its consistence, passing from the solid to the shadowy condition, and, before two minutes had elapsed, the spirit-form had entirely disappeared.  The short stranger turned and confronted the party, with a long, loud laugh, like nothing in nature.  The professor talked excitedly to Kent-Smith in low tones.  Faull beckoned Backhouse behind a wing of scenery, and handed him his check without a word.  The medium put it in his pocket, buttoned his coat, and walked out of the room.  Lang followed him, in order to get a drink.  The stranger poked his face up into Maskull's.  "Well, giant, what do you think of it all?  Wouldn't you like to see the land where this sort of fruit grows wild?"  "What sort of fruit?"  "That specimen goblin."  Maskull waved him away with his huge hand.  "Who are you, and how did you come here?"  "Call up your friend.  Perhaps he may recognise me."  Nightspore had moved a chair to the fire, and was watching the embers with a set, fanatical expression.  "Let Krag come to me, if he wants me," he said, in his strange voice.  "You see, he does know me," uttered Krag, with a humorous look. Walking over to Nightspore, he put a hand on the back of his chair.  "Still the same old gnawing hunger?"  "What is doing these days?" demanded Nightspore disdainfully, without altering his attitude.  "Surtur has gone, and we are to follow him."  "How do you two come to know each other, and of whom are you speaking?" asked Maskull, looking from one to the other in perplexity.  "Krag has something for us.  Let us go outside," replied Nightspore. He got up, and glanced over his shoulder.  Maskull, following the direction of his eye, observed that the few remaining men were watching their little group attentively.    Chapter 2  IN THE STREET  The three men gathered in the street outside the house.  The night was slightly frosty, but particularly clear, with an east wind blowing.  The multitude of blazing stars caused the sky to appear like a vast scroll of hieroglyphic symbols.  Maskull felt oddly excited; he had a sense that something extraordinary was about to happen "What brought you to this house tonight, Krag, and what made you do what you did?  How are we understand that apparition?"  "That must have been Crystalman's expression on face," muttered Nightspore.  "We have discussed that, haven't we, Maskull?  Maskull is anxious to behold that rare fruit in its native wilds."  Maskull looked at Krag carefully, trying to analyse his own feelings toward him.  He was distinctly repelled by the man's personality, yet side by side with this aversion a savage, living energy seemed to spring up in his heart that in some strange fashion was attributable to Krag.  "Why do you insist on this simile?" he asked.  "Because it is apropos.  Nightspore's quite right.  That was Crystalman's face, and we are going to Crystalman's country."  "And where is this mysterious country?"  "Tormance."  "That's a quaint name.  But where is it?"  Krag grinned, showing his yellow teeth in the light of the street lamp.  "It is the residential suburb of Arcturus."  "What is he talking about, Nightspore? ...  Do you mean the star of that name?" he went on, to Krag.  "Which you have in front of you at this very minute" said Krag, pointing a thick finger toward the brightest star in the south- eastern sky.  "There you see Arcturus, and Tormance is its one inhabited planet."  Maskull looked at the heavy, gleaning star, and again at Krag.  Then he pulled out a pipe, and began to fill it.  "You must have cultivated a new form of humour, Krag."  "I am glad if I can amuse you, Maskull, if only for a few days."  "I meant to ask you--how do you know my name?"  "It would be odd if I didn't, seeing that I only came here on your account.  As a matter of fact, Nightspore and I are old friends."  Maskull paused with his suspended match.  "You came here on my account?"  "Surely.  On your account and Nightspore's.  We three are to be fellow travellers."  Maskull now lit his pipe and puffed away coolly for a few moments.  "I'm sorry, Krag, but I must assume you are mad."  Krag threw his head back, and gave a scraping laugh.  "Am I mad, Nightspore?"  "Has Surtur gone to Tormance?" ejaculated Nightspore in a strangled voice, fixing his eyes on Krag's face.  "Yes, and he requires that we follow him at once."  Maskull's heart began to beat strangely.  It all sounded to him like a dream conversation.  "And since how long, Krag, have I been required to do things by a total stranger....  Besides, who is this individual?"  "Krag's chief," said Nightspore, turning his head away.  "The riddle is too elaborate for me.  I give up."  "You are looking for mysteries," said Krag, "so naturally you are finding them.  Try and simplify your ideas, my friend.  The affair is plain and serious."  Maskull stared hard at him and smoked rapidly.  "Where have you come from now?" demanded Nightspore suddenly.  "From the old observatory at Starkness....  Have you heard of the famous Starkness Observatory, Maskull?"  "No.  Where is it?"  "On the north-east coast of Scotland.  Curious discoveries are made there from time to time."  "As, for example, how to make voyages to the stars.  So this Surtur turns out to be an astronomer.  And you too, presumably?"  Krag grinned again.  "How long will it take you to wind up your affairs?  When can you be ready to start?"  "You are too considerate," said Maskull, laughing outright.  "I was beginning to fear that I would be hauled away at once....  However, I have neither wife, land, nor profession, so there's nothing to wait for....  What is the itinerary?"  "You are a fortunate man.  A bold, daring heart, and no encumbrances."  Krag's features became suddenly grave and rigid. "Don't be a fool, and refuse a gift of luck.  A gift declined is not offered a second time."  "Krag," replied Maskull simply, returning his pipe to his pocket.  "I ask you to put yourself in my place.  Even if were a man sick for adventures, how could I listen seriously to such an insane proposition as this?  What do I know about you, or your past record? You may be a practical joker, or you may have come out of a madhouse-- I know nothing about it.  If you claim to be an exceptional man, and want my cooperation, you must offer me exceptional proofs."  "And what proofs would you consider adequate, Maskull?"  As he spoke he gripped Maskull's arm.  A sharp, chilling pain immediately passed through the latter's body and at the same moment his brain caught fire.  A light burst in upon him like the rising of the sun.  He asked himself for the first time if this fantastic conversation could by any chance refer to real things.  "Listen, Krag," he said slowly, while peculiar images and conceptions started to travel in rich disorder through his mind.  "You talk about a certain journey.  Well, if that journey were a possible one, and I were given the chance of making it, I would be willing never to come back.  For twenty-four hours on that Arcturian planet, I would give my life.  That is my attitude toward that journey....  Now prove to me that you're not talking nonsense.  Produce your credentials."  Krag stared at him all the time he was speaking, his face gradually resuming its jesting expression.  "Oh, you will get your twenty-four hours, and perhaps longer, but not much longer.  You're an audacious fellow, Maskull, but this trip will prove a little strenuous, even for you....  And so, like the unbelievers of old, you want a sign from heaven?"  Maskull frowned.  "But the whole thing is ridiculous.  Our brains are overexcited by what took place in there.  Let us go home, and sleep it off."  Krag detained him with one hand, while groping in his breast pocket with the other.  He presently fished out what resembled a small folding lens.  The diameter of the glass did not exceed two inches.  "First take a peep at Arcturus through this, Maskull.  It may serve as a provisional sign.  It's the best I can do, unfortunately.  I am not a travelling magician....  Be very careful not to drop it.  It's somewhat heavy."  Maskull took the lens in his hand, struggled with it for a minute, and then looked at Krag in amazement.  The little object weighed at least twenty pounds, though it was not much bigger than a crown piece.  "What stuff can this be, Krag?"  "Look through it, my good friend.  That's what I gave it to you for."  Maskull held it up with difficulty, directed it toward the gleaming Arcturus, and snatched as long and as steady a glance at the star as the muscles of his arm would permit.  What he saw was this.  The star, which to the naked eye appeared as a single yellow point of light, now became clearly split into two bright but minute suns, the larger of which was still yellow, while its smaller companion was a beautiful blue.  But this was not all.  Apparently circulating around the yellow sun was a comparatively small and hardly distinguishable satellite, which seemed to shine, not by its own, but by reflected light....  Maskull lowered and raised his arm repeatedly.  The same spectacle revealed itself again and again, but he was able to see nothing else.  Then he passed back the lens to Krag, without a word, and stood chewing his underlip.  "You take a glimpse too," scraped Krag, proffering the glass to Nightspore.  Nightspore turned his back and began to pace up an down.  Krag laughed sardonically, and returned the lens to his pocket.  "Well, Maskull, are you satisfied?"  "Arcturus, then, is a double sun.  And is that third point the planet Tormance?"  "Our future home, Maskull."  Maskull continued to ponder.  "You inquire if I am satisfied.  I don't know, Krag.  It's miraculous, and that's all I can say about it.... But I'm satisfied of one thing.  There must be very wonderful astronomers at Starkness and if you invite me to your observatory I will surely come."  "I do invite you.  We set off from there."  "And you, Nightspore?" demanded Maskull.  "The journey has to be made," answered his friend in indistinct tones, "though I don't see what will come of it."  Krag shot a penetrating glance at him.  "More remarkable adventures than this would need to be arranged before we could excite Nightspore."  "Yet he is coming."  "But not con amore.  He is coming merely to bear you company."  Maskull again sought the heavy, sombre star, gleaming in solitary might, in the south-eastern heavens, and, as he gazed, his heart swelled with grand and painful longings, for which, however, he was unable to account to his own intellect.  He felt that his destiny was in some way bound up with this gigantic, far-distant sun.  But still he did not dare to admit to himself Krag's seriousness.  He heard his parting remarks in deep abstraction, and only after the lapse of several minutes, when, alone with Nightspore, did he realise that they referred to such mundane matters as travelling routes and times of trains.  "Does Krag travel north with us, Nightspore?  I didn't catch that."  "No.  We go on first, and he joins us at Starkness on the evening of the day after tomorrow."  Maskull remained thoughtful.  "What am I to think of that man?"  "For your information," replied Nightspore wearily, "I have never known him to lie."    Chapter 3  STARKNESS  A couple of days later, at two o'clock in the afternoon, Maskull and Nightspore arrived at Starkness Observatory, having covered the seven miles from Haillar Station on foot.  The road, very wild and lonely, ran for the greater part of the way near the edge of rather lofty cliffs, within sight of the North Sea.  The sun shone, but a brisk east wind was blowing and the air was salt and cold.  The dark green waves were flecked with white.  Throughout the walk, they were accompanied by the plaintive, beautiful crying of the gulls.  The observatory presented itself to their eyes as a self-contained little community, without neighbours, and perched on the extreme end of the land.  There were three buildings: a small, stone-built dwelling house, a low workshop, and, about two hundred yards farther north, a square tower of granite masonry, seventy feet in height.  The house and the shop were separated by an open yard, littered with waste.  A single stone wall surrounded both, except on the side facing the sea, where the house itself formed a continuation of the cliff.  No one appeared.  The windows were all closed, and Maskull could have sworn that the whole establishment was shut up and deserted.  He passed through the open gate, followed by Nightspore, and knocked vigorously at the front door.  The knocker was thick with dust and had obviously not been used for a long time.  He put his ear to the door, but could hear no movements inside the house.  He then tried the handle; the door was looked.  They walked around the house, looking for another entrance, but there was only the one door.  "This isn't promising," growled Maskull  "There's no one here..... Now you try the shed, while I go over to that tower."  Nightspore, who had not spoken half a dozen words since leaving the train, complied in silence, and started off across the yard.  Maskull passed out of the gate again.  When he arrived at the foot of the tower, which stood some way back from the cliff, he found the door heavily padlocked.  Gazing up, he saw six windows, one above the other at equal distances, all on the east face--that is, overlooking the sea.  Realising that no satisfaction was to be gained here, he came away again, still more irritated than before.  When he rejoined his friend, Nightspore reported that the workshop was also locked.  "Did we, or did we not, receive an invitation?" demanded Maskull energetically.  "The house is empty," replied Nightspore, biting his nails.  "Better break a window."  "I certainly don't mean to camp out till Krag condescends to come."  He picked up an old iron bolt from the yard and, retreating to a safe distance, hurled it against a sash window on the ground floor.  The lower pane was completely shattered.  Carefully avoiding the broken glass, Maskull thrust his hand through the aperture and pushed back the frame fastening.  A minute later they had climbed through and were standing inside the house.  The room, which was a kitchen, was in an indescribably filthy and neglected condition.  The furniture scarcely held together, broken utensils and rubbish lay on the floor instead of on the dust heap, everything was covered with a deep deposit of dust.  The atmosphere was so foul that Maskull judged that no fresh air had passed into the room for several months.  Insects were crawling on the walls.  They went into the other rooms on the lower floor--a scullery, a barely furnished dining room, and a storing place for lumber.  The same dirt, mustiness, and neglect met their eyes.  At least half a year must have elapsed since these rooms were last touched, or even entered.  "Does your faith in Krag still hold?" asked Maskull.  "I confess mine is at vanishing point.  If this affair isn't one big practical joke, it has every promise of being one.  Krag never lived here in his life."  "Come upstairs first," said Nightspore.  The upstairs rooms proved to consist of a library and three bedrooms. All the windows were tightly closed, and the air was insufferable. The beds had been slept in, evidently a long time ago, and had never been made since.  The tumbled, discoloured bed linen actually preserved the impressions of the sleepers.  There was no doubt that these impressions were ancient, for all sorts of floating dirt had accumulated on the sheets and coverlets.  "Who could have slept here, do you think?" interrogated Maskull. "The observatory staff?"  "More likely travellers like ourselves.  They left suddenly."  Maskull flung the windows wide open in every room he came to, and held his breath until he had done so.  Two of the bedrooms faced the sea; the third, the library, the upward-sloping moorland.  This library was now the only room left unvisited, and unless they discovered signs of recent occupation here Maskull made up his mind to regard the whole business as a gigantic hoax.  But the library, like all the other rooms, was foul with stale air and dust-laden.  Maskull, having flung the window up and down, fell heavily into an armchair and looked disgustedly at his friend.  "Now what is your opinion of Krag?"  Nightspore sat on the edge of the table which stood before the window.  "He may still have left a message for us."  "What message?  Why?  Do you mean in this room?--I see no message."  Nightspore's eyes wandered about the room, finally seeming to linger upon a glass-fronted wall cupboard, which contained a few old bottles on one of the shelves and nothing else.  Maskull glanced at him and at the cupboard.  Then, without a word, he got up to examine the bottles.  There were four altogether, one of which was larger than the rest. The smaller ones were about eight inches long.  All were torpedo- shaped, but had flattened bottoms, which enabled them to stand upright.  Two of the smaller ones were empty and unstoppered, the others contained a colourless liquid, and possessed queer-looking, nozzle-like stoppers that were connected by a thin metal rod with a catch halfway down the side of the bottle.  They were labelled, but the labels were yellow with age and the writing was nearly undecipherable.  Maskull carried the filled bottles with him to the table in front of the window, in order to get better light. Nightspore moved away to make room for him.  He now made out on the larger bottle the words "Solar Back Rays"; and on the other one, after some doubt, he thought that he could distinguish something like "Arcturian Back Rays."  He looked up, to stare curiously at his friend.  "Have you been here before, Nightspore?"  "I guessed Krag would leave a message."  "Well, I don't know--it may be a message, but it means nothing to us, or at all events to me.  What are 'back rays'?"  "Light that goes back to its source," muttered Nightspore.  "And what kind of light would that be?"  Nightspore seemed unwilling to answer, but, finding Maskull's eyes still fixed on him, he brought out: "Unless light pulled, as well as pushed, how would flowers contrive to twist their heads around after the sun?"  "I don't know.  But the point is, what are these bottles for?"  While he was still talking, with his hand on the smaller bottle, the other, which was lying on its side, accidentally rolled over in such a manner that the metal caught against the table.  He made a movement to stop it, his hand was actually descending, when--the bottle suddenly disappeared before his eyes.  It had not rolled off the table, but had really vanished--it was nowhere at all.  Maskull stared at the table.  After a minute he raised his brows, and turned to Nightspore with a smile.  "The message grows more intricate."  Nightspore looked bored.  "The valve became unfastened.  The contents have escaped through the open window toward the sun, carrying the bottle with them.  But the bottle will be burned up by the earth's atmosphere, and the contents will dissipate, and will not reach the sun."  Maskull listened attentively, and his smile faded.  "Does anything prevent us from experimenting with this other bottle?"  "Replace it in the cupboard," said Nightspore.  "Arcturus is still below the horizon, and you would succeed only in wrecking the house."  Maskull remained standing before the window, pensively gazing out at the sunlit moors.  "Krag treats me like a child," he remarked presently.  "And perhaps I really am a child....  My cynicism must seem most amusing to Krag. But why does he leave me to find out all this by myself--for I don't include you, Nightspore....  But what time will Krag be here?"  "Not before dark, I expect," his friend replied.    Chapter 4  THE VOICE  It was by this time past three o'clock.  Feeling hungry, for they had eaten nothing since early morning, Maskull went downstairs to forage, but without much hope of finding anything in the shape of food.  In a safe in the kitchen he discovered a bag of mouldy oatmeal, which was untouchable, a quantity of quite good tea in an airtight caddy, and an unopened can of ox tongue.  Best of all, in the dining-room cupboard he came across an uncorked bottle of first-class Scotch whisky.  He at once made preparations for a scratch meal.  A pump in the yard ran clear after a good deal of hard working at it, and he washed out and filled the antique kettle.  For firewood, one of the kitchen chairs was broken up with a chopper.  The light, dusty wood made a good blaze in the grate, the kettle was boiled, and cups were procured and washed.  Ten minutes later the friends were dining in the library.  Nightspore ate and drank little, but Maskull sat down with good appetite.  There being no milk, whisky took the place of it; the nearly black tea was mixed with an equal quantity of the spirit.  Of this concoction Maskull drank cup after cup, and long after the tongue had disappeared he was still imbibing.  Nightspore looked at him queerly.  "Do you intend to finish the bottle before Krag comes?"  "Krag won't want any, and one must do something.  I feel restless."  "Let us take a look at the country."  The cup, which was on its way to Maskull's lips, remained poised in the air.  "Have you anything in view, Nightspore?"  "Let us walk out to the Gap of Sorgie."  "What's that?"  "A showplace," answered Nightspore, biting his lip.  Maskull finished off the cup, and rose to his feet.  "Walking is better than soaking at any time, and especially on a day like this....  How far is it?"  "Three or four miles each way."  "You probably mean something," said Maskull, "for I'm beginning to regard you as a second Krag.  But if so, so much the better. I am growing nervous, and need incidents."  They left the house by the door, which they left ajar, and immediately found themselves again on the moorland road that had brought them from Haillar.  This time they continued along it, past the tower.  Maskull, as they went by, regarded the erection with puzzled interest.  "What is that tower, Nightspore?"  "We sail from the platform on the top."  "Tonight?"--throwing him a quick look.  "Yes."  Maskull smiled, but his eyes were grave.  "Then we are looking at the gateway of Arcturus, and Krag is now travelling north to unlock it."  "You no longer think it impossible, I fancy," mumbled Nightspore.  After a mile or two, the road parted from the sea coast and swerved sharply inland, across the hills.  With Nightspore as guide, they left it and took to the grass.  A faint sheep path marked the way along the cliff edge for some distance, but at the end of another mile it vanished.  The two men then had some rough walking up and down hillsides and across deep gullies.  The sun disappeared behind the hills, and twilight imperceptibly came on.  They soon reached a spot where further progress appeared impossible.  The buttress of a mountain descended at a steep angle to the very edge of the cliff, forming an impassable slope of slippery grass.  Maskull halted, stroked his beard, and wondered what the next step was to be.  "There's a little scrambling here," said Nightspore.  "We are both used to climbing, and there is not much in it."  He indicated a narrow ledge, winding along the face of the precipice a few yards beneath where they were standing.  It averaged from fifteen to thirty inches in width.  Without waiting for Maskull's consent to the undertaking, he instantly swung himself down and started walking along this ledge at a rapid pace.  Maskull, seeing that there was no help for it, followed him.  The shelf did not extend for above a quarter of a mile, but its passage was somewhat unnerving; there was a sheer drop to the sea, four hundred feet below.  In a few places they had to sidle along without placing one foot before another.  The sound of the breakers came up to them in a low, threatening roar.  Upon rounding a corner, the ledge broadened out into a fair-sized platform of rock and came to a sudden end.  A narrow inlet of the sea separated them from the continuation of the cliffs beyond.  "As we can't get any further," said Maskull, "I presume this is your Gap of Sorgie?"  "Yes," answered his friend, first dropping on his knees and then lying at full length, face downward.  He drew his head and shoulders over the edge and began to stare straight down at the water.  "What is there interesting down there, Nightspore?"  Receiving no reply, however, he followed his friend's example, and the next minute was looking for himself.  Nothing was to be seen; the gloom had deepened, and the sea was nearly invisible.  But, while he was ineffectually gazing, he heard what sounded like the beating of a drum on the narrow strip of shore below.  It was very faint, but quite distinct.  The beats were in four-four time, with the third beat slightly accented.  He now continued to hear the noise all the time he was lying there.  The beats were in no way drowned by the far louder sound of the surf, but seemed somehow to belong to a different world....  When they were on their feet again, he questioned Nightspore.  "We came here solely to hear that?"  Nightspore cast one of his odd looks at him.  "It's called locally 'The Drum Taps of Sorgie.'  You will not hear that name again, but perhaps you will hear the sound again."  "And if I do, what will it imply?" demanded Maskull in amazement.  "It bears its own message.  Only try always to hear it more and more distinctly....  Now it's growing dark, and we must get back."  Maskull pulled out his watch automatically, and looked at the time. It was past six....  But he was thinking of Nightspore's words, and not of the time.  Night had already fallen by the time they regained the tower.  The black sky was glorious with liquid stars.  Arcturus was a little way above the sea, directly opposite them, in the east.  As they were passing the base of the tower, Maskull observed with a sudden shock that the gate was open.  He caught hold of Nightspore's arm violently.  "Look!  Krag is back."  "Yes, we must make haste to the house."  "And why not the tower?  He's probably in there, since the gate is open.  I'm going up to look."  Nightspore grunted, but made no opposition.  All was pitch-black inside the gate.  Maskull struck a match, and the flickering light disclosed the lower end of a circular flight of stone steps.  "Are you coming up?" he asked.  "No, I'll wait here."  Maskull immediately began the ascent.  Hardly had he mounted half a dozen steps, however, before he was compelled to pause, to gain breath.  He seemed to be carrying upstairs not one Maskull, but three.  As he proceeded, the sensation of crushing weight, so far from diminishing, grew worse and worse.  It was nearly physically impossible to go on; his lungs could not take in enough oxygen, while his heart thumped like a ship's engine.  Sweat coursed down his face. At the twentieth step he completed the first revolution of the tower and came face to face with the first window, which was set in a high embrasure.  Realising that he could go no higher, he struck another match, and climbed into the embrasure, in order that he might at all events see something from the tower.  The flame died, and he stared through the window at the stars.  Then, to his astonishment, he discovered that it was not a window at all but a lens....  The sky was not a wide expanse of space containing a multitude of stars, but a blurred darkness, focused only in one part, where two very bright stars, like small moons in size, appeared in close conjunction; and near them a more minute planetary object, as brilliant as Venus and with an observable disk.  One of the suns shone with a glaring white light; the other was a weird and awful blue.  Their light, though almost solar in intensity, did not illuminate the interior of the tower.  Maskull knew at once that the system of spheres at which he was gazing was what is known to astronomy as the star Arcturus....  He had seen the sight before, through Krag's glass, but then the scale had been smaller, the colors of the twin suns had not appeared in their naked reality....  These colors seemed to him most marvellous, as if, in seeing them through earth eyes, he was not seeing them correctly....  But it was at Tormance that he stared the longest and the most earnestly.  On that mysterious and terrible earth, countless millions of miles distant, it had been promised him that he would set foot, even though he might leave his bones there.  The strange creatures that he was to behold and touch were already living, at this very moment.  A low, sighing whisper sounded in his ear, from not more than a yard away.  "Don't you understand, Maskull, that you are only an instrument, to be used and then broken?  Nightspore is asleep now, but when he wakes you must die.  You will go, but he will return."  Maskull hastily struck another match, with trembling fingers.  No one was in sight, and all was quiet as the tomb.  The voice did not sound again.  After waiting a few minutes, he redescended to the foot of the tower.  On gaining the open air, his sensation of weight was instantly removed, but he continued panting and palpitating, like a man who has lifted a far too heavy load.  Nightspore's dark form came forward.  "Was Krag there?"  "If he was.  I didn't see him.  But I heard someone speak."  "Was it Krag?"  "It was not Krag--but a voice warned me against you."  "Yes, you will hear these voices too," said Nightspore enigmatically.    Chapter 5  THE NIGHT OF DEPARTURE  When they returned to the house, the windows were all in darkness and the door was ajar, just as they had left it; Krag presumably was not there.  Maskull went all over the house, striking matches in every room--at the end of the examination he was ready to swear that the man they were expecting had not even stuck his nose inside the premises.  Groping their way into the library, they sat down in the total darkness to wait, for nothing else remained to be done. Maskull lit his pipe, and began to drink the remainder of the whisky. Through the open window sounded in their ears the trainlike grinding of the sea at the foot of the cliffs.  "Krag must be in the tower after all," remarked Maskull, breaking the silence.  "Yes, he is getting ready."  "I hope he doesn't expect us to join him there.  It was beyond my powers--but why, heaven knows.  The stairs must have a magnetic pull of some sort."  "It is Tormantic gravity," muttered Nightspore.  "I understand you--or, rather, I don't--but it doesn't matter."  He went on smoking in silence, occasionally taking a mouthful of the neat liquor.  "Who is Surtur?" he demanded abruptly.  "We others are gropers and bunglers, but he is a master."  Maskull digested this.  "I fancy you are right, for though I know nothing about him his mere name has an exciting effect on me....  Are you personally acquainted with him?"  "I must be... I forget..." replied Nightspore in a choking voice.  Maskull looked up, surprised, but could make nothing out in the blackness of the room.  "Do you know so many extraordinary men that you can forget some of them? ...  Perhaps you can tell me this... will we meet him, where we are going?"  "You will meet death, Maskull....  Ask me no more questions--I can't answer them."  "Then let us go on waiting for Krag," said Maskull coldly.  Ten minutes later the front door slammed, and a light, quick footstep was heard running up the stairs.  Maskull got up, with a beating heart.  Krag appeared on the threshold of the door, bearing in his hand a feebly glimmering lantern.  A hat was on his head, and he looked stern and forbidding.  After scrutinising the two friends for a moment or so, he strode into the room and thrust the lantern on the table.  Its light hardly served to illuminate the walls.  "You have got here, then, Maskull?"  "So it seems--but I shan't thank you for your hospitality, for it has been conspicuous by its absence."  Krag ignored the remark.  "Are you ready to start?"  "By all means--when you are.  It is not so entertaining here."  Krag surveyed him critically.  "I heard you stumbling about in the tower.  You couldn't get up, it seems."  "It looks like an obstacle, for Nightspore informs me that the start takes place from the top."  "But your other doubts are all removed?"  "So far, Krag, that I now possess an open mind.  I am quite willing to see what you can do."  "Nothing more is asked....  But this tower business.  You know that until you are able to climb to the top you are unfit to stand the gravitation of Tormance?"  "Then I repeat, it's an awkward obstacle, for I certainly can't get up."  Krag hunted about in his pockets, and at length produced a clasp knife.  "Remove you coat, and roll up your shirt sleeve," he directed.  "Do you propose to make an incision with that?"  "Yes, and don't start difficulties, because the effect is certain, but you can't possibly understand it beforehand."  "Still, a cut with a pocket-knife--" began Maskull, laughing.  "It will answer, Maskull," interrupted Nightspore.  "Then bare your arm too, you aristocrat of the universe," said Krag. "Let us see what your blood is made of."  Nightspore obeyed.  Krag pulled out the big blade of the knife, and made a careless and almost savage slash at Maskull's upper arm.  The wound was deep, and blood flowed freely.  "Do I bind it up?" asked Maskull, scowling with pain.  Krag spat on the wound.  "Pull your shirt down, it won't bleed any more."  He then turned his attention to Nightspore, who endured his operation with grim indifference.  Krag threw the knife on the floor.  An awful agony, emanating from the wound, started to run through Maskull's body, and he began to doubt whether he would not have to faint, but it subsided almost immediately, and then he felt nothing but a gnawing ache in the injured arm, just strong enough to make life one long discomfort.  "That's finished," said Krag.  "Now you can follow me."  Picking up the lantern, he walked toward the door.  The others hastened after him, to take advantage of the light, and a moment later their footsteps, clattering down the uncarpeted stairs, resounded through the deserted house.  Krag waited till they were out, and then banged the front door after them with such violence that the windows shook.  While they were walking swiftly across to the tower, Maskull caught his arm.  "I heard a voice up those stairs."  "What did it say?"  "That I am to go, but Nightspore is to return."  Krag smiled.  "The journey is getting notorious," he remarked, after a pause.  "There must be ill-wishers about....  Well, do you want to return?"  "I don't know what I want.  But I thought the thing was curious enough to be mentioned."  "It is not a bad thing to hear voices," said Krag, "but you mustn't for a minute imagine that all is wise that comes to you out of the night world."  When they had arrived at the open gateway of the tower, he immediately set foot on the bottom step of the spiral staircase and ran nimbly up, bearing the lantern.  Maskull followed him with some trepidation, in view of his previous painful experience on these stairs, but when, after the first half-dozen steps, he discovered that he was still breathing freely, his dread changed to relief and astonishment, and he could have chattered like a girl.  At the lowest window Krag went straight ahead without stepping, but Maskull clambered into the embrasure, in order to renew his acquaintance with the miraculous spectacle of the Arcturian group. The lens had lost its magic property.  It had become a common sheet of glass, through which the ordinary sky field appeared.  The climb continued, and at the second and third windows he again mounted and stared out, but still the common sights presented themselves.  After that, he gave up and looked through no more windows.  Krag and Nightspore meanwhile had gone on ahead with the light, so that he had to complete the ascent in darkness.  When he was near the top, he saw yellow light shining through the crack of a half-opened door.  His companions were standing just inside a small room, shut off from the staircase by rough wooden planking; it was rudely furnished and contained nothing of astronomical interest.  The lantern was resting on a table.  Maskull walked in and looked around him with curiosity.  "Are we at the top?"  "Except for the platform over our heads," replied Krag.  "Why didn't that lowest window magnify, as it did earlier in the evening?"  "Oh, you missed your opportunity," said Krag, grinning.  "If you had finished your climb then, you would have seen heart-expanding sights.  From the fifth window, for example, you would have seen Tormance like a continent in relief; from the sixth you would have seen it like a landscape....  But now there's no need."  "Why not--and what has need got to do with it?"  "Things are changed, my friend, since that wound of yours.  For the same reason that you have now been able to mount the stairs, there was no necessity to stop and gape at illusions en route."  "Very well," said Maskull, not quite understanding what he meant. "But is this Surtur's den?"  "He has spent time here."  "I wish you would describe this mysterious individual, Krag.  We may not get another chance."  "What I said about the windows also applies to Surtur.  There's no need to waste time over visualising him, because you are immediately going on to the reality."  "Then let us go."  He pressed his eyeballs wearily.  "Do we strip?" asked Nightspore.  "Naturally," answered Krag, and he began to tear off his clothes with slow, uncouth movements.  "Why?" demanded Maskull, following, however, the example of the other two men.  Krag thumped his vast chest, which was covered with thick hairs, like an ape's.  "Who knows what the Tormance fashions are like?  We may sprout limbs--I don't say we shall."  "A-ha!" exclaimed Maskull, pausing in the middle of his undressing.  Krag smote him on the back.  "New pleasure organs possible, Maskull. You like that?"  The three men stood as nature made them.  Maskull's spirits rose fast, as the moment of departure drew near.  "A farewell drink to success!" cried Krag, seizing a bottle and breaking its head off between his fingers.  There were no glasses, but he poured the amber-coloured wine into some cracked cups.  Perceiving that the others drank, Maskull tossed off his cupful.  It was as if he had swallowed a draught of liquid electricity....  Krag dropped onto the floor and rolled around on his back, kicking his legs in the air.  He tried to drag Maskull down on top of him, and a little horseplay went on between the two.  Nightspore took no part in it, but walked to and fro, like a hungry caged animal.  Suddenly, from out-of-doors, there came a single prolonged, piercing wail, such as a banshee might be imagined to utter.  It ceased abruptly, and was not repeated.  "What's that?" called out Maskull, disengaging himself impatiently from Krag.  Krag rocked with laughter.  "A Scottish spirit trying to reproduce the bagpipes of its earth life--in honour of our departure."  Nightspore turned to Krag.  "Maskull will sleep throughout the journey?"  "And you too, if you wish, my altruistic friend.  I am pilot, and you passengers can amuse yourselves as you please."  "Are we off at last?" asked Maskull.  "Yes, you are about to cross your Rubicon, Maskull.  But what a Rubicon! ...  Do you know that it takes light a hundred years or so to arrive here from Arcturus?  Yet we shall do it in nineteen hours."  "Then you assert that Surtur is already there?"  "Surtur is where he is.  He is a great traveller."  "Won't I see him?"  Krag went up to him and looked him in the eyes.  "Don't forget that you have asked for it, and wanted it.  Few people in Tormance will know more about him than you do, but your memory will be your worst friend."  He led the way up a short iron ladder, mounting through a trap to the flat roof above.  When they were up, he switched on a small electric torch.  Maskull beheld with awe the torpedo of crystal that was to convey them through the whole breadth of visible space.  It was forty feet long, eight wide, and eight high; the tank containing the Arcturian back rays was in front, the car behind.  The nose of the torpedo was directed toward the south-eastern sky.  The whole machine rested upon a flat platform, raised about four feet above the level of the roof, so as to encounter no obstruction on starting its flight.  Krag flashed the light on to the door of the car, to enable them to enter.  Before doing so, Maskull gazed sternly once again at the gigantic, far-distant star, which was to be their sun from now onward.  He frowned, shivered slightly, and got in beside Nightspore. Krag clambered past them onto his pilot's seat.  He threw the flashlight through the open door, which was then carefully closed, fastened, and screwed up.  He pulled the starting lever.  The torpedo glided gently from its platform, and passed rather slowly away from the tower, seaward.  Its speed increased sensibly, though not excessively, until the approximate limits of the earth's atmosphere were reached.  Krag then released the speed valve, and the car sped on its way with a velocity more nearly approaching that of thought than of light.  Maskull had no opportunity of examining through the crystal walls the rapidly changing panorama of the heavens.  An extreme drowsiness oppressed him.  He opened his eyes violently a dozen times, but on the thirteenth attempt he failed.  From that time forward he slept heavily.  The bored, hungry expression never left Nightspore's face.  The alterations in the aspect of the sky seemed to possess not the least interest for him.  Krag sat with his hand on the lever, watching with savage intentness his phosphorescent charts and gauges.    Chapter 6  JOIWIND  IT WAS DENSE NIGHT when Maskull awoke from his profound sleep.  A wind was blowing against him, gentle but wall-like, such as he had never experienced on earth.  He remained sprawling on the ground, as he was unable to lift his body because of its intense weight.  A numbing pain, which he could not identify with any region of his frame, acted from now onward as a lower, sympathetic note to all his other sensations.  It gnawed away at him continuously; sometimes it embittered and irritated him, at other times he forgot it.  He felt something hard on his forehead.  Putting his hand up, he discovered there a fleshy protuberance the size of a small plum, having a cavity in the middle, of which he could not feel the bottom. Then he also became aware of a large knob on each side of his neck, an inch below the ear.  From the region of his heart, a tentacle had budded.  It was as long as his arm, but thin, like whipcord, and soft and flexible.  As soon as he thoroughly realised the significance of these new organs, his heart began to pump.  Whatever might, or might not, be their use, they proved one thing that he was in a new world.  One part of the sky began to get lighter than the rest.  Maskull cried out to his companions, but received no response.  This frightened him.  He went on shouting out, at irregular intervals-- equally alarmed at the silence and at the sound of his own voice. Finally, as no answering hail came, he thought it wiser not to make too much noise, and after that he lay quiet, waiting in cold blood for what might happen.  In a short while he perceived dim shadows around him, but these were not his friends.  A pale, milky vapour over the ground began to succeed the black night, while in the upper sky rosy tints appeared.  On earth, one would have said that day was breaking.  The brightness went on imperceptibly increasing for a very long time.  Maskull then discovered that he was lying on sand.  The colour of the sand was scarlet.  The obscure shadows he had seen were bushes, with black stems and purple leaves.  So far, nothing else was visible.  The day surged up.  It was too misty for direct sunshine, but before long the brilliance of the light was already greater than that of the midday sun on earth.  The heat, too, was intense, but Maskull welcomed it--it relieved his pain and diminished his sense of crushing weight.  The wind had dropped with the rising of the sun.  He now tried to get onto his feet, but succeeded only in kneeling. He was unable to see far.  The mists had no more than partially dissolved, and all that he could distinguish was a narrow circle of red sand dotted with ten or twenty bushes.  He felt a soft, cool touch on the back of his neck.  He started forward in nervous fright and, in doing so, tumbled over onto the sand.  Looking up over his shoulder quickly, he was astounded to see a woman standing beside him.  She was clothed in a single flowing, pale green garment, rather classically draped.  According to earth standards she was not beautiful, for, although her face was otherwise human, she was endowed--or afflicted--with the additional disfiguring organs that Maskull had discovered in himself.  She also possessed the heart tentacle.  But when he sat up, and their eyes met and remained in sympathetic contact, he seemed to see right into a soul that was the home of love, warmth, kindness, tenderness, and intimacy.  Such was the noble familiarity of that gaze, that he thought he knew her. After that, he recognised all the loveliness of her person.  She was tall and slight.  All her movements were as graceful as music.  Her skin was not of a dead, opaque colour, like that of an earth beauty, but was opalescent; its hue was continually changing, with every thought and emotion, but none of these tints was vivid--all were delicate, half-toned, and poetic.  She had very long, loosely plaited, flaxen hair.  The new organs, as soon as Maskull had familiarised himself with them, imparted something to her face that was unique and striking.  He could not quite define it to himself, but subtlety and inwardness seemed added.  The organs did not contradict the love of her eyes or the angelic purity of her features, but nevertheless sounded a deeper note--a note that saved her from mere girlishness.  Her gaze was so friendly and unembarrassed that Maskull felt scarcely any humiliation at sitting at her feet, naked and helpless.  She realised his plight, and put into his hands a garment that she had been carrying over her arm.  It was similar to the one she was wearing, but of a darker, more masculine colour.  "Do you think you can put it on by yourself?"  He was distinctly conscious of these words, yet her voice had not sounded.  He forced himself up to his feet, and she helped him to master the complications of the drapery.  "Poor man--how you are suffering!" she said, in the same inaudible language.  This time he discovered that the sense of what she said was received by his brain through the organ on his forehead.  "Where am I?  Is this Tormance?" he asked.  As he spoke, he staggered.  She caught him, and helped him to sit down.  "Yes.  You are with friends."  Then she regarded him with a smile, and began speaking aloud, in English.  Her voice somehow reminded him of an April day, it was so fresh, nervous, and girlish.  "I can now understand your language. It was strange at first.  In the future I'll speak to you with my mouth."  "This is extraordinary!  What is this organ?" he asked, touching his forehead.  "It is named the 'breve.'  By means of it we read one another's thoughts.  Still, speech is better, for then the heart can be read too."  He smiled.  "They say that speech is given us to deceive others."  "One can deceive with thought, too.  But I'm thinking of the best, not the worst."  "Have you seen my friends?"  She scrutinised him quietly, before answering.  "Did you not come alone?"  "I came with two other men, in a machine.  I must have lost consciousness on arrival, and I haven't seen them since."  "That's very strange!  No, I haven't seen them.  They can't be here, or we would have known it.  My husband and I--"  "What is your name, and your husband's name?"  "Mine is Joiwind--my husband's is Panawe.  We live a very long way from here; still, it came to us both last night that you were lying here insensible.  We almost quarrelled about which of us should come to you, but in the end I won."  Here she laughed.  "I won, because I am the stronger-hearted of the two; he is the purer in perception."  "Thanks, Joiwind!" said Maskull simply.  The colors chased each other rapidly beneath her skin.  "Oh, why do you say that?  What pleasure is greater than loving-kindness?  I rejoiced at the opportunity....  But now we must exchange blood."  "What is this?" he demanded, rather puzzled.  "It must be so.  Your blood is far too thick and heavy for our world. Until you have an infusion of mine, you will never get up."  Maskull flushed.  "I feel like a complete ignoramus here....  Won't it hurt you?"  "If your blood pains you, I suppose it will pain me.  But we will share the pain."  "This is a new kind of hospitality to me," he muttered.  "Wouldn't you do the same for me?" asked Joiwind, half smiling, half agitated.  "I can't answer for any of my actions in this world.  I scarcely know where I am....  Why, yes--of course I would, Joiwind."  While they were talking it had become full day.  The mists had rolled away from the ground, and only the upper atmosphere remained fog- charged.  The desert of scarlet sand stretched in all directions, except one, where there was a sort of little oasis--some low hills, clothed sparsely with little purple trees from base to summit.  It was about a quarter of a mile distant.  Joiwind had brought with her a small flint knife.  Without any trace of nervousness, she made a careful, deep incision on her upper arm. Maskull expostulated.  "Really, this part of it is nothing," she said, laughing.  "And if it were--a sacrifice that is no sacrifice--what merit is there in that? ... Come now--your arm!"  The blood was streaming down her arm.  It was not red blood, but a milky, opalescent fluid.  "Not that one!" said Maskull, shrinking.  "I have already been cut there."  He submitted the other, and his blood poured forth.  Joiwind delicately and skilfully placed the mouths of the two wounds together, and then kept her arm pressed tightly against Maskull's for a long time.  He felt a stream of pleasure entering his body through the incision.  His old lightness and vigour began to return to him. After about five minutes a duel of kindness started between them; he wanted to remove his arm, and she to continue.  At last he had his way, but it was none too soon--she stood there pale and dispirited.  She looked at him with a more serious expression than before, as if strange depths had opened up before her eyes.  "What is your name?"  "Maskull."  "Where have you come from, with this awful blood?"  "From a world called Earth....  The blood is clearly unsuitable for this world, Joiwind, but after all, that was only to be expected.  I am sorry I let you have your way."  "Oh, don't say that!  There was nothing else to be done.  We must all help one another.  Yet, somehow--forgive me--I feel polluted."  "And well you may, for it's a fearful thing for a girl to accept in her own veins the blood of a strange man from a strange planet.  If I had not been so dazed and weak I would never have allowed it."  "But I would have insisted.  Are we not all brothers and sisters? Why did you come here, Maskull?"  He was conscious of a slight degree of embarrassment.  "Will you think it foolish if I say I hardly know?--I came with those two men. Perhaps I was attracted by curiosity, or perhaps it was the love of adventure."  "Perhaps," said Joiwind.  "I wonder...  These friends of yours must be terrible men.  Why did they come?"  "That I can tell you.  They came to follow Surtur."  Her face grew troubled.  "I don't understand it.  One of them at least must be a bad man, and yet if he is following Surtur--or Shaping, as he is called here--he can't be really bad."  "What do you know of Surtur?" asked Maskull in astonishment.  Joiwind remained silent for a time, studying his face.  His brain moved restlessly, as though it were being probed from outside.  "I see.... and yet I don't see," she said at last.  "It is very difficult....  Your God is a dreadful Being--bodyless, unfriendly, invisible.  Here we don't worship a God like that.  Tell me, has any man set eyes on your God?"  "What does all this mean, Joiwind?  Why speak of God?"  "I want to know."  "In ancient times, when the earth was young and grand, a few holy men are reputed to have walked and spoken with God, but those days are past."  "Our world is still young," said Joiwind.  "Shaping goes among us and converses with us.  He is real and active--a friend and lover. Shaping made us, and he loves his work."  "Have you met him?" demanded Maskull, hardly believing his ears.  "No.  I have done nothing to deserve it yet.  Some day I may have an opportunity to sacrifice myself, and then I may be rewarded by meeting and talking with Shaping."  "I have certainly come to another world.  But why do you say he is the same as Surtur?"  "Yes, he is the same.  We women call him Shaping, and so do most men, but a few name him Surtur."  Maskull bit his nail.  "Have you ever heard of Crystalman?"  "That is Shaping once again.  You see, he has many names--which shows how much he occupies our minds.  Crystalman is a name of affection."  "It's odd," said Maskull.  "I came here with quite different ideas about Crystalman."  Joiwind shook her hair.  "In that grove of trees over there stands a desert shrine of his.  Let us go and pray there, and then we'll go on our way to Poolingdred.  That is my home.  It's a long way off, and we must get there before Blodsombre."  "Now, what is Blodsombre?"  "For about four hours in the middle of the day Branchspell's rays are so hot that no one can endure them.  We call it Blodsombre."  "Is Branchspell another name for Arcturus?"  Joiwind threw off her seriousness and laughed.  "Naturally we don't take our names from you, Maskull.  I don't think our names are very poetic, but they follow nature."  She took his arm affectionately, and directed their walk towards the tree-covered hills.  As they went along, the sun broke through the upper mists and a terrible gust of scorching heat, like a blast from a furnace, struck Maskull's head.  He involuntarily looked up, but lowered his eyes again like lightning.  All that he saw in that instant was a glaring ball of electric white, three times the apparent diameter of the sun.  For a few minutes he was quite blind.  "My God!" he exclaimed.  "If it's like this in early morning you must be right enough about Blodsombre."  When he had somewhat recovered himself he asked, "How long are the days here, Joiwind?"  Again he felt his brain being probed.  "At this time of the year, for every hour's daylight that you have in summer, we have two."  "The heat is terrific--and yet somehow I don't feel so distressed by it as I would have expected."  "I feel it more than usual.  It's not difficult to account for it; you have some of my blood, and I have some of yours."  "Yes, every time I realise that, I--Tell me, Joiwind, will my blood alter, if I stay here long enough?--I mean, will it lose its redness and thickness, and become pure and thin and light-coloured, like yours?"  "Why not?  If you live as we live, you will assuredly grow like us."  "Do you mean food and drink?"  "We eat no food, and drink only water."  "And on that you manage to sustain life?"  "Well, Maskull, our water is good water," replied Joiwind, smiling.  As soon as he could see again he stared around at the landscape.  The enormous scarlet desert extended everywhere to the horizon, excepting where it was broken by the oasis.  It was roofed by a cloudless, deep blue, almost violet, sky.  The circle of the horizon was far larger than on earth.  On the skyline, at right angles to the direction in which they were walking, appeared a chain of mountains, apparently about forty miles distant.  One, which was higher than the rest, was shaped like a cup.  Maskull would have felt inclined to believe he was travelling in dreamland, but for the intensity of the light, which made everything vividly real.  Joiwind pointed to the cup-shaped mountain.  "That's Poolingdred."  "You didn't come from there!" he exclaimed, quite startled.  "Yes, I did indeed.  And that is where we have to go to now."  "With the single object of finding me?"  "Why, yes."  The colour mounted to his face.  "Then you are the bravest and noblest of all girls," he said quietly, after a pause.  "Without exception.  Why, this is a journey for an athlete!"  She pressed his arm, while a score of unpaintable, delicate hues stained her cheeks in rapid transition.  "Please don't say any more about it, Maskull.  It makes me feel unpleasant."  "Very well.  But can we possibly get there before midday?"  "Oh, yes.  And you mustn't be frightened at the distance.  We think nothing of long distances here--we have so much to think about and feel.  Time goes all too quickly."  During their conversation they had drawn neat the base of the hills, which sloped gently, and were not above fifty feet in height. Maskull now began to see strange specimens of vegetable life.  What looked like a small patch of purple grass, above five feet square, was moving across the sand in their direction.  When it came near enough he perceived that it was not grass; there were no blades, but only purple roots.  The roots were revolving, for each small plant in the whole patch, like the spokes of a rimless wheel.  They were alternately plunged in the sand, and withdrawn from it, and by this means the plant proceeded forward.  Some uncanny, semi-intelligent instinct was keeping all the plants together, moving at one pace, in one direction, like a flock of migrating birds in flight.  Another remarkable plant was a large, feathery ball, resembling a dandelion fruit, which they encountered sailing through the air. Joiwind caught it with an exceedingly graceful movement of her arm, and showed it to Maskull.  It had roots and presumably lived in the air and fed on the chemical constituents of the atmosphere.  But what was peculiar about it was its colour.  It was an entirely new colour-- not a new shade or combination, but a new primary colour, as vivid as blue, red, or yellow, but quite different.  When he inquired, she told him that it was known as "ulfire."  Presently he met with a second new colour.  This she designated "jale."  The sense impressions caused in Maskull by these two additional primary colors can only be vaguely hinted at by analogy.  Just as blue is delicate and mysterious, yellow clear and unsubtle, and red sanguine and passionate, so he felt ulfire to be wild and painful, and jale dreamlike, feverish, and voluptuous.  The hills were composed of a rich, dark mould.  Small trees, of weird shapes, all differing from each other, but all purple-coloured, covered the slopes and top.  Maskull and Joiwind climbed up and through.  Some hard fruit, bright blue in colour, of the size of a large apple, and shaped like an egg, was lying in profusion underneath the trees.  "Is the fruit here poisonous, or why don't you eat it?" asked Maskull.  She looked at him tranquilly.  "We don't eat living things.  The thought is horrible to us."  "I have nothing to say against that, theoretically.  But do you really sustain your bodies on water?"  "Supposing you could find nothing else to live on, Maskull--would you eat other men?"  "I would not."  "Neither will we eat plants and animals, which are our fellow creatures.  So nothing is left to us but water, and as one can really live on anything, water does very well."  Maskull picked up one of the fruits and handled it curiously.  As he did so another of his newly acquired sense organs came into action. He found that the fleshy knobs beneath his ears were in some novel fashion acquainting him with the inward properties of the fruit.  He could not only see, feel, and smell it, but could detect its intrinsic nature.  This nature was hard, persistent and melancholy.  Joiwind answered the questions he had not asked.  "Those organs are called 'poigns.'  Their use is to enable us to understand and sympathise with all living creatures."  "What advantage do you derive from that, Joiwind?"  "The advantage of not being cruel and selfish, dear Maskull."  He threw the fruit away and flushed again.  Joiwind looked into his swarthy, bearded face without embarrassment and slowly smiled.  "Have I said too much?  Have I been too familiar? Do you know why you think so?  It's because you are still impure.  By and by you will listen to all language without shame."  Before he realised what she was about to do, she threw her tentacle round his neck, like another arm.  He offered no resistance to its cool pressure.  The contact of her soft flesh with his own was so moist and sensitive that it resembled another kind of kiss.  He saw who it was that embraced him--a pale, beautiful girl.  Yet, oddly enough, he experienced neither voluptuousness nor sexual pride.  The love expressed by the caress was rich, glowing, and personal, but there was not the least trace of sex in it--and so he received it.  She removed her tentacle, placed her two arms on his shoulders and penetrated with her eyes right into his very soul.  "Yes, I wish to be pure," he muttered.  "Without that what can I ever be but a weak, squirming devil?"  Joiwind released him.  "This we call the 'magn,'" she said, indicating her tentacle.  "By means of it what we love already we love more, and what we don't love at all we begin to love."  "A godlike organ!"  "It is the one we guard most jealously," said Joiwind.  The shade of the trees afforded a timely screen from the now almost insufferable rays of Branchspell, which was climbing steadily upward to the zenith.  On descending the other side of the little hills, Maskull looked anxiously for traces of Nightspore and Krag, but without result.  After staring about him for a few minutes he shrugged his shoulders; but suspicions had already begun to gather in his mind.  A small, natural amphitheatre lay at their feet, completely circled by the tree-clad heights.  The centre was of red sand.  In the very middle shot up a tall, stately tree, with a black trunk and branches, and transparent, crystal leaves.  At the foot of this tree was a natural, circular well, containing dark green water.  When they had reached the bottom, Joiwind took him straight over to the well.  Maskull gazed at it intently.  "Is this the shrine you talked about?"  "Yes.  It is called Shaping's Well.  The man or woman who wishes to invoke Shaping must take up some of the gnawl water, and drink it."  "Pray for me," said Maskull.  "Your unspotted prayer will carry more weight."  "What do you wish for?"  "For purity," answered Maskull, in a troubled voice.  Joiwind made a cup of her hand, and drank a little of the water.  She held it up to Maskull's mouth.  "You must drink too."  He obeyed.  She then stood erect, closed her eyes, and, in a voice like the soft murmurings of spring, prayed aloud.  "Shaping, my father, I am hoping you can hear me.  A strange man has come to us weighed down with heavy blood.  He wishes to be pure.  Let him know the meaning of love, let him live for others.  Don't spare him pain, dear Shaping, but let him seek his own pain.  Breathe into him a noble soul."  Maskull listened with tears in his heart.  As Joiwind finished speaking, a blurred mist came over his eyes, and, half buried in the scarlet sand, appeared a large circle of dazzlingly white pillars.  For some minutes they flickered to and fro between distinctness and indistinctness, like an object being focused.  Then they faded out of sight again.  "Is that a sign from Shaping?" asked Maskull, in a low, awed tone.  "Perhaps it is.  It is a time mirage."  "What can that be, Joiwind?"  "You see, dear Maskull, the temple does not yet exist but it will do so, because it must.  What you and I are now doing in simplicity, wise men will do hereafter in full knowledge."  "It is right for man to pray," said Maskull.  "Good and evil in the world don't originate from nothing.  God and Devil must exist.  And we should pray to the one, and fight the other."  "Yes, we must fight Krag."  "What name did you say?" asked Maskull in amazement.  "Krag--the author of evil and misery--whom you call Devil."  He immediately concealed his thoughts.  To prevent Joiwind from learning his relationship to this being, he made his mind a blank.  "Why do you hide your mind from me?" she demanded, looking at him strangely and changing colour.  "In this bright, pure, radiant world, evil seems so remote, one can scarcely grasp its meaning."  But he lied.  Joiwind continued gazing at him, straight out of her clean soul. "The world is good and pure, but many men are corrupt.  Panawe, my husband, has travelled, and he has told me things I would almost rather have not heard.  One person he met believed the universe to be, from top to bottom, a conjurer's cave."  "I should like to meet your husband."  "Well, we are going home now."  Maskull was on the point of inquiring whether she had any children, but was afraid of offending her, and checked himself.  She read the mental question.  "What need is there?  Is not the whole world full of lovely children?  Why should I want selfish possessions?"  An extraordinary creature flew past, uttering a plaintive cry of five distinct notes.  It was not a bird, but had a balloon-shaped body, paddled by five webbed feet.  It disappeared among the trees.  Joiwind pointed to it, as it went by.  "I love that beast, grotesque as it is--perhaps all the more for its grotesqueness.  But if I had children of my own, would I still love it?  Which is best--to love two or three, or to love all?"  "Every woman can't be like you, Joiwind, but it is good to have a few like you.  Wouldn't it be as well," he went on, "since we've got to walk through that sun-baked wilderness, to make turbans for our heads out of some of those long leaves?"  She smiled rather pathetically.  "You will think me foolish, but every tearing off of a leaf would be a wound in my heart.  We have only to throw our robes over our heads."  "No doubt that will answer the same purpose, but tell me--weren't these very robes once part of a living creature?"  "Oh, no--no, they are the webs of a certain animal, but they have never been in themselves alive."  "You reduce life to extreme simplicity," remarked Maskull meditatively, "but it is very beautiful."  Climbing back over the hills, they now without further ceremony began their march across the desert.  They walked side by side.  Joiwind directed their course straight toward Poolingdred.  From the position of the sun, Maskull judged their way to lie due north.  The sand was soft and powdery, very tiring to his naked feet.  The red glare dazed his eyes, and made him semi-blind.  He was hot, parched, and tormented with the craving to drink; his undertone of pain emerged into full consciousness.  "I see my friends nowhere, and it is very queer."  "Yes, it is queer--if it is accidental," said Joiwind, with a peculiar intonation.  "Exactly!" agreed Maskull.  "If they had met with a mishap, their bodies would still be there.  It begins to look like a piece of bad work to me.  They must have gone on, and left me....  Well, I am here, and I must make the best of it, I will trouble no more about them."  "I don't wish to speak ill of anyone," said Joiwind, "but my instinct tells me that you are better away from those men.  They did not come here for your sake, but for their own."  They walked on for a long time.  Maskull was beginning to feel faint. She twined her magn lovingly around his waist, and a strong current of confidence and well-being instantly coursed through his veins.  "Thanks, Joiwind!  But am I not weakening you?"  "Yes," she replied, with a quick, thrilling glance.  "But not much-- and it gives me great happiness."  Presently they met a fantastic little creature, the size of a new- born lamb, waltzing along on three legs.  Each leg in turn moved to the front, and so the little monstrosity proceeded by means of a series of complete rotations.  It was vividly coloured, as though it had been dipped into pots of bright blue and yellow paint.  It looked up with small, shining eyes, as they passed.  Joiwind nodded and smiled to it.  "That's a personal friend of mine, Maskull.  Whenever I come this way, I see it.  It's always waltzing, and always in a hurry, but it never seems to get anywhere."  "It seems to me that life is so self-sufficient here that there is no need for anyone to get anywhere.  What I don't quite understand is how you manage to pass your days without ennui."  "That's a strange word.  It means, does it not, craving for excitement?"  "Something of the kind," said Maskull.  "That must be a disease brought on by rich food."  "But are you never dull?"  "How could we be?  Our blood is quick and light and free, our flesh is clean and unclogged, inside and out....  Before long I hope you will understand what sort of question you have asked."  Farther on they encountered a strange phenomenon.  In the heart of the desert a fountain rose perpendicularly fifty feet into the air, with a cool and pleasant hissing sound.  It differed, however, from a fountain in this respect--that the water of which it was composed did not return to the ground but was absorbed by the atmosphere at the summit.  It was in fact a tall, graceful column of dark green fluid, with a capital of coiling and twisting vapours.  When they came closer, Maskull perceived that this water column was the continuation and termination of a flowing brook, which came down from the direction of the mountains.  The explanation of the phenomenon was evidently that the water at this spot found chemical affinities in the upper air, and consequently forsook the ground.  "Now let us drink," said Joiwind.  She threw herself unaffectedly at full length on the sand, face downward, by the side of the brook, and Maskull was not long in following her example.  She refused to quench her thirst until she had seen him drink.  He found the water heavy, but bubbling with gas. He drank copiously.  It affected his palate in a new way--with the purity and cleanness of water was combined the exhilaration of a sparkling wine, raising his spirits--but somehow the intoxication brought out his better nature, and not his lower.  "We call it 'gnawl water'," said Joiwind.  "This is not quite pure, as you can see by the colour.  At Poolingdred it is crystal clear.  But we would be ungrateful if we complained.  After this you'll find we'll get along much better."  Maskull now began to realise his environment, as it were for the first time.  All his sense organs started to show him beauties and wonders that he had not hitherto suspected.  The uniform glaring scarlet of the sands became separated into a score of clearly distinguished shades of red.  The sky was similarly split up into different blues.  The radiant heat of Branchspell he found to affect every part of his body with unequal intensities.  His ears awakened; the atmosphere was full of murmurs, the sands hummed, even the sun's rays had a sound of their own--a kind of faint Aeolian harp. Subtle, puzzling perfumes assailed his nostrils.  His palate lingered over the memory of the gnawl water.  All the pores of his skin were tickled and soothed by hitherto unperceived currents of air.  His poigns explored actively the inward nature of everything in his immediate vicinity.  His magn touched Joiwind, and drew from her person a stream of love and joy.  And lastly by means of his breve he exchanged thoughts with her in silence.  This mighty sense symphony stirred him to the depths, and throughout the walk of that endless morning he felt no more fatigue.  When it was drawing near to Blodsombre, they approached the sedgy margin of a dark green lake, which lay underneath Poolingdred.  Panawe was sitting on a dark rock, waiting for them.    Chapter 7  PANAWE  The husband got up to meet his wife and their guest.  He was clothed in white.  He had a beardless face, with breve and poigns.  His skin, on face and body alike, was so white, fresh, and soft, that it scarcely looked skin at all--it rather resembled a new kind of pure, snowy flesh, extending right down to his bones.  It had nothing in common with the artificially whitened skin of an over-civilised woman.  Its whiteness and delicacy aroused no voluptuous thoughts; it was obviously the manifestation of a cold and almost cruel chastity of nature.  His hair, which fell to the nape of his neck, also was white; but again, from vigour, not decay.  His eyes were black, quiet and fathomless.  He was still a young man, but so stern were his features that he had the appearance of a lawgiver, and this in spite of their great beauty and harmony.  His magn and Joiwind's intertwined for a single moment and Maskull saw his face soften with love, while she looked exultant.  She put him in her husband's arms with gentle force, and stood back, gazing and smiling.  Maskull felt rather embarrassed at being embraced by a man, but submitted to it; a sense of cool, pleasant languor passed through him in the act.  "The stranger is red-blooded, then?"  He was startled by Panawe's speaking in English, and the voice too was extraordinary.  It was absolutely tranquil, but its tranquillity seemed in a curious fashion to be an illusion, proceeding from a rapidity of thoughts and feelings so great that their motion could not be detected.  How this could be, he did not know.  "How do you come to speak in a tongue you have never heard before?" demanded Maskull.  "Thought is a rich, complex thing.  I can't say if I am really speaking your tongue by instinct, or if you yourself are translating my thoughts into your tongue as I utter them."  "Already you see that Panawe is wiser than I am," said Joiwind gaily.  "What is your name?" asked the husband.  "Maskull."  "That name must have a meaning--but again, thought is a strange thing.  I connect that name with something--but with what?"  "Try to discover," said Joiwind.  "Has there been a man in your world who stole something from the Maker of the universe, in order to ennoble his fellow creatures?"  "There is such a myth, The hero's name was Prometheus."  "Well, you seem to be identified in my mind with that action--but what it all means I can't say, Maskull."  "Accept it as a good omen, for Panawe never lies, and never speaks thoughtlessly."  "There must be some confusion.  These are heights beyond me," said Maskull calmly, but looking rather contemplative.  "Where do you come from?"  "From the planet of a distant sun, called Earth."  "What for?"  "I was tired of vulgarity," returned Maskull laconically.  He intentionally avoided mentioning his fellow voyagers, in order that Krag's name should not come to light.  "That's an honourable motive," said Panawe.  "And what's more, it may be true, though you spoke it as a prevarication."  "As far as it goes, it's quite true," said Maskull, staring at him with annoyance and surprise.  The swampy lake extended for about half a mile from where they were standing to the lower buttresses of the mountain.  Feathery purple reeds showed themselves here and there through the shallows.  The water was dark green.  Maskull did not see how they were going to cross it.  Joiwind caught his arm.  "Perhaps you don't know that the lake will bear us?"  Panawe walked onto the water; it was so heavy that it carried his weight.  Joiwind followed with Maskull.  He instantly started to slip about--nevertheless the motion was amusing, and he learned so fast, by watching and imitating Panawe, that he was soon able to balance himself without assistance.  After that he found the sport excellent.  For the same reason that women excel in dancing, Joiwind's half falls and recoveries were far more graceful and sure than those of either of the men.  Her slight, draped form--dipping, bending, rising, swaying, twisting, upon the surface of the dark water--this was a picture Maskull could not keep his eyes away from.  The lake grew deeper.  The gnawl water became green-black.  The crags, gullies, and precipices of the shore could now be distinguished in detail.  A waterfall was visible, descending several hundred feet.  The surface of the lake grew disturbed--so much so that Maskull had difficulty in keeping his balance.  He therefore threw himself down and started swimming on the face of the water. Joiwind turned her head, and laughed so joyously that all her teeth flashed in the sunlight.  They landed in a few more minutes on a promontory of black rock.  The water on Maskull's garment and body evaporated very quickly.  He gazed upward at the towering mountain, but at that moment some strange movements on the part of Panawe attracted his attention.  His face was working convulsively, and he began to stagger about.  Then he put his hand to his mouth and took from it what looked like a bright-coloured pebble.  He looked at it carefully for some seconds.  Joiwind also looked, over his shoulder, with quickly changing colors.  After this inspection, Panawe let the object-- whatever it was--fall to the ground, and took no more interest in it.  "May I look?" asked Maskull; and, without waiting for permission, he picked it up.  It was a delicately beautiful egg-shaped crystal of pale green.  "Where did this come from?" he asked queerly.  Panawe turned away, but Joiwind answered for him.  "It came out of my husband."  "That's what I thought, but I couldn't believe it.  But what is it?"  "I don't know that it has either name or use.  It is merely an overflowing of beauty."  "Beauty?"  Joiwind smiled.  "If you were to regard nature as the husband, and Panawe as the wife, Maskull, perhaps everything would be explained."  Maskull reflected.  "On Earth," he said after a minute, "men like Panawe are called artists, poets, and musicians.  Beauty overflows into them too, and out of them again.  The only distinction is that their productions are more human and intelligible."  "Nothing comes from it but vanity," said Panawe, and, taking the crystal out of Maskull's hand, he threw it into the lake.  The precipice they now had to climb was several hundred feet in height.  Maskull was more anxious for Joiwind than for himself.  She was evidently tiring, but she refused all help, and was in fact still the nimbler of the two.  She made a mocking face at him.  Panawe seemed lost in quiet thoughts.  The rock was sound, and did not crumble under their weight.  The heat of Branchspell, however, was by this time almost killing, the radiance was shocking in its white intensity, and Maskull's pain steadily grew worse.  When they got to the top, a plateau of dark rock appeared, bare of vegetation, stretching in both directions as far as the eye could see.  It was of a nearly uniform width of five hundred yards, from the edge of the cliffs to the lower slopes of the chain of hills inland.  The hills varied in height.  The cup-shaped Poolingdred was approximately a thousand feet above them.  The upper part of it was covered with a kind of glittering vegetation which he could not comprehend.  Joiwind put her hand on Maskull's shoulder, and pointed upward. "Here you have the highest peak in the whole land--that is, until you come to the Ifdawn Marest."  On hearing that strange name, he experienced a momentary unaccountable sensation of wild vigour and restlessness--but it passed away.  Without losing time, Panawe led the way up the mountainside.  The lower half was of bare rock, not difficult to climb.  Halfway up, however, it grew steeper, and they began to meet bushes and small trees.  The growth became thicker as they continued to ascend, and when they neared the summit, tall forest trees appeared.  These bushes and trees had pale, glassy trunks and branches, but the small twigs and the leaves were translucent and crystal.  They cast no shadows from above, but still the shade was cool.  Both leaves and branches were fantastically shaped.  What surprised Maskull the most, however, was the fact that, as far as he could see, scarcely any two plants belonged to the same species.  "Won't you help Maskull out of his difficulty?" said Joiwind, pulling her husband's arm.  He smiled.  "If he'll forgive me for again trespassing in his brain. But the difficulty is small.  Life on a new planet, Maskull, is necessarily energetic and lawless, and not sedate and imitative. Nature is still fluid--not yet rigid--and matter is plastic.  The will forks and sports incessantly, and thus no two creatures are alike."  "Well, I understand all that," replied Maskull, after listening attentively.  "But what I don't grasp is this--if living creatures here sport so energetically, how does it come about that human beings wear much the same shape as in my world?"  "I'll explain that too," said Panawe.  "All creatures that resemble Shaping must of necessity resemble one another."  "Then sporting is the blind will to become like Shaping?"  "Exactly."  "It is most wonderful," said Maskull.  "Then the brotherhood of man is not a fable invented by idealists, but a solid fact."  Joiwind looked at him, and changed colour.  Panawe relapsed into sternness.  Maskull became interested in a new phenomenon.  The jale-coloured blossoms of a crystal bush were emitting mental waves, which with his breve he could clearly distinguish.  They cried out silently, "To me To me!"  While he looked, a flying worm guided itself through the air to one of these blossoms and began to suck its nectar.  The floral cry immediately ceased.  They now gained the crest of the mountain, and looked down beyond.  A lake occupied its crater-like cavity.  A fringe of trees partly intercepted the view, but Maskull was able to perceive that this mountain lake was nearly circular and perhaps a quarter of a mile across.  Its shore stood a hundred feet below them.  Observing that his hosts did not propose to descend, he begged them to wait for him, and scrambled down to the surface.  When he got there, he found the water perfectly motionless and of a colourless transparency.  He walked onto it, lay down at full length, and peered into the depths.  It was weirdly clear: he could see down for an indefinite distance, without arriving at any bottom.  Some dark, shadowy objects, almost out of reach of his eyes, were moving about. Then a sound, very faint and mysterious, seemed to come up through the gnawl water from an immense depth.  It was like the rhythm of a drum.  There were four beats of equal length, but the accent was on the third.  It went on for a considerable time, and then ceased.  The sound appeared to him to belong to a different world from that in which he was travelling.  The latter was mystical, dreamlike, and unbelievable--the drumming was like a very dim undertone of reality. It resembled the ticking of a clock in a room full of voices, only occasionally possible to be picked up by the ear.  He rejoined Panawe and Joiwind, but said nothing to them about his experience.  They all walked round the rim of the crater, and gazed down on the opposite side.  Precipices similar to those that had overlooked the desert here formed the boundary of a vast moorland plain, whose dimensions could not be measured by the eye.  It was solid land, yet he could not make out its prevailing colour.  It was as if made of transparent glass, but it did not glitter in the sunlight.  No objects in it could be distinguished, except a rolling river in the far distance, and, farther off still, on the horizon, a line of dark mountains, of strange shapes.  Instead of being rounded, conical, or hogbacked, these heights were carved by nature into the semblance of castle battlements, but with extremely deep indentations.  The sky immediately above the mountains was of a vivid, intense blue. It contrasted in a most marvellous way with the blue of the rest of the heavens.  It seemed more luminous and radiant, and was in fact like the afterglow of a gorgeous blue sunset.  Maskull kept on looking.  The more he gazed, the more restless and noble became his feelings.  "What is that light?"  Panawe was sterner than usual, while his wife clung to his arm.  "It is Alppain--our second sun," he replied.  "Those hills are the Ifdawn Marest....  Now let us get to our shelter."  "Is it imagination, or am I really being affected--tormented by that light?"  "No, it's not imagination--it's real.  How can it be otherwise when two suns, of different natures, are drawing you at the same time? Luckily you are not looking at Alppain itself.  It's invisible here. You would need to go at least as far as Ifdawn, to set eyes on it."  "Why do you say 'luckily'?"  "Because the agony caused by those opposing forces would perhaps be more than you could bear....  But I don't know."  For the short distance that remained of their walk, Maskull was very thoughtful and uneasy.  He understood nothing.  Whatever object his eye chanced to rest on changed immediately into a puzzle.  The silence and stillness of the mountain peak seemed brooding, mysterious, and waiting.  Panawe gave him a friendly, anxious look, and without further delay led the way down a little track, which traversed the side of the mountain and terminated in the mouth of a cave.  This cave was the home of Panawe and Joiwind.  It was dark inside. The host took a shell and, filling it with liquid from a well, carelessly sprinkled the sandy floor of the interior.  A greenish, phosphorescent light gradually spread to the furthest limits of the cavern, and continued to illuminate it for the whole time they were there.  There was no furniture.  Some dried, fernlike leaves served for couches.  The moment she got in, Joiwind fell down in exhaustion.  Her husband tended her with calm concern.  He bathed her face, put drink to her lips, energised her with his magn, and finally laid her down to sleep.  At the sight of the noble woman thus suffering on his account, Maskull was distressed.  Panawe, however, endeavoured to reassure him.  "It's quite true this has been a very long, hard double journey, but for the future it will lighten all her other journeys for her....  Such is the nature of sacrifice."  "I can't conceive how I have walked so far in a morning," said Maskull, "and she has been twice the distance."  "Love flows in her veins, instead of blood, and that's why she is so strong."  "You know she gave me some of it?"  "Otherwise you couldn't even have started."  "I shall never forget that."  The languorous beat of the day outside, the bright mouth of the cavern, the cool seclusion of the interior, with its pale green glow, invited Maskull to sleep.  But curiosity got the better of his lassitude.  "Will it disturb her if we talk?"  "No."  "But how do you feel?"  "I require little sleep.  In any case, it's more important that you should hear something about your new life.  It's not all as innocent and idyllic as this.  If you intend to go through, you ought to be instructed about the dangers."  "Oh, I guessed as much.  But how shall we arrange--shall I put questions, or will you tell me what you think is most essential?"  Panawe motioned to Maskull to sit down on a pile of ferns, and at the same time reclined himself, leaning on one arm, with outstretched legs.  "I will tell some incidents of my life.  You will begin to learn from them what sort of place you have come to."  "I shall be grateful," said Maskull, preparing himself to listen.  Panawe paused for a moment or two, and then started his narrative in tranquil, measured, yet sympathetic tones.  PANAWE'S STORY  "My earliest recollection is of being taken, when three years old (that's equivalent to fifteen of your years, but we develop more slowly here), by my father and mother, to see Broodviol, the wisest man in Tormance.  He dwelt in the great Wombflash Forest.  We walked through trees for three days, sleeping at night.  The trees grew taller as we went along, until the tops were out of sight.  The trunks were of a dark red colour and the leaves were of pale ulfire. My father kept stopping to think.  If left uninterrupted, he would remain for half a day in deep abstraction.  My mother came out of Poolingdred, and was of a different stamp.  She was beautiful, generous, and charming--but also active.  She kept urging him on. This led to many disputes between them, which made me miserable.  On the fourth day we passed through a part of the forest which bordered on the Sinking Sea.  This sea is full of pouches of water that will not bear a man's weight, and as these light parts don't differ in appearance from the rest, it is dangerous to cross.  My father pointed out a dim outline on the horizon, and told me it was Swaylone's Island.  Men sometimes go there, but none ever return.  In the evening of the same day we found Broodviol standing in a deep, miry pit in the forest, surrounded on all sides by trees three hundred feet high.  He was a big gnarled, rugged, wrinkled, sturdy old man.  His age at that time was a hundred and twenty of our years, or nearly six hundred of yours.  His body was trilateral: he had three legs, three arms, and six eyes, placed at equal distances all around his head.  This gave him an aspect of great watchfulness and sagacity.  He was standing in a sort of trance.  I afterward heard this saying of his: 'To lie is to sleep, to sit is to dream, to stand is to think.'  My father caught the infection, and fell into meditation, but my mother roused them both thoroughly.  Broodviol scowled at her savagely, and demanded what she required.  Then I too learned for the first time the object of our journey.  I was a prodigy--that is to say, I was without sex.  My parents were troubled over this, and wished to consult the wisest of men.  "Old Broodviol smoothed his face, and said, 'This perhaps will not be so difficult.  I will explain the marvel.  Every man and woman among us is a walking murderer.  If a male, he has struggled with and killed the female who was born in the same body with him--if a female, she has killed the male.  But in this child the struggle is still continuing.'  "'How shall we end it?' asked my mother.  "'Let the child direct its will to the scene of the combat, and it will be of whichever sex it pleases.'  "'You want, of course, to be a man, don't you?' said my mother to me earnestly.  "'Then I shall be slaying your daughter, and that would be a crime.'  "Something in my tone attracted Broodviol's notice.  "'That was spoken, not selfishly, but magnanimously.  Therefore the male must have spoken it, and you need not trouble further.  Before you arrive home, the child will be a boy.'  "My father walked away out of sight.  My mother bent very low before Broodviol for about ten minutes, and he remained all that time looking kindly at her.  "I heard that shortly afterward Alppain came into that land for a few hours daily.  Broodviol grew melancholy, and died.  "His prophecy came true--before we reached home, I knew the meaning of shame.  But I have often pondered over his words since, in later years, when trying to understand my own nature; and I have come to the conclusion that, wisest of men as he was, he still did not see quite straight on this occasion.  Between me and my twin sister, enclosed in one body, there never was any struggle, but instinctive reverence for life withheld both of us from fighting for existence. Hers was the stronger temperament, and she sacrificed herself-- though not consciously--for me.  "As soon as I comprehended this, I made a vow never to eat or destroy anything that contained life--and I have kept it ever since.  "While I was still hardly a grown man, my father died.  My mother's death followed immediately, and I hated the associations of the land. I therefore made up my mind to travel into my mother's country, where, as she had often told me, nature was most sacred and solitary.  "One hot morning I came to Shaping's Causeway.  It is so called either because Shaping once crossed it, or because of its stupendous character.  It is a natural embankment, twenty miles long, which links the mountains bordering my homeland with the Ifdawn Marest. The valley lies below at a depth varying from eight to ten thousand feet--a terrible precipice on either side.  The knife edge of the ridge is generally not much over a foot wide.  The causeway goes due north and south.  The valley on my right hand was plunged in shadow-- that on my left was sparkling with sunlight and dew.  I walked fearfully along this precarious path for some miles.  Far to the east the valley was closed by a lofty tableland, connecting the two chains of mountains, but overtopping even the most towering pinnacles.  This is called the Sant Levels.  I was never there, but I have heard two curious facts concerning the inhabitants.  The first is that they have no women; the second, that though they are addicted to travelling in other parts they never acquire habits of the peoples with whom they reside.  "Presently I turned giddy, and lay at full length for a great while, clutching the two edges of the path with both hands, and staring at the ground I was lying on with wide-open eyes.  When that passed I felt like a different man and grew conceited and gay.  About halfway across I saw someone approaching me a long way off.  This put fear into my heart again, for I did not see how we could very well pass. However, I went slowly on, and presently we drew near enough together for me to recognise the walker.  It was Slofork, the so-called sorcerer.  I had never met him before, but I knew him by his peculiarities of person.  He was of a bright gamboge colour and possessed a very long, proboscis-like nose, which appeared to be a useful organ, but did not add to his beauty, as I knew beauty.  He was dubbed 'sorcerer' from his wondrous skill in budding limbs and organs.  The tale is told that one evening he slowly sawed his leg off with a blunt stone and then lay for two days in agony while his new leg was sprouting.  He was not reputed to be a consistently wise man, but he had periodical flashes of penetration and audacity that none could equal.  "We sat down and faced one another, about two yards apart.  "'Which of us walks over the other?' asked Slofork.  His manner was as calm as the day itself, but, to my young nature, terrible with hidden terrors.  I smiled at him, but did not wish for this humiliation.  We continued sitting thus, in a friendly way, for many minutes.  "'What is greater than Pleasure?' he asked suddenly.  "I was at an age when one wishes to be thought equal to any emergency, so, concealing my surprise, I applied myself to the conversation, as if it were for that purpose we had met.  "'Pain,' I replied, 'for pain drives out pleasure.'  "'What is greater than Pain?'  "I reflected.  'Love.  Because we will accept our loved one's share of pain.'  "'But what is greater than Love?' he persisted.  "'Nothing, Slofork.'  "'And what is Nothing?'  "'That you must tell me.'  "'Tell you I will.  This is Shaping's world.  He that is a good child here, knows pleasure, pain, and love, and gets his rewards.  But there's another world--not Shaping's and there all this is unknown, and another order of things reigns.  That world we call Nothing--but it is not Nothing, but Something.'  "There was a pause.  "'I have heard,' said I, 'that you are good at growing and ungrowing organs?'  "'That's not enough for me.  Every organ tells me the same story.  I want to hear different stories.'  "'Is it true, what men say, that your wisdom flows and ebbs in pulses?'  "'Quite true,' replied Slofork.  'But those you had it from did not add that they have always mistaken the flow for the ebb.'  "'My experience is,' said I sententiously, 'that wisdom is misery.'  "'Perhaps it is, young man, but you have never learned that, and never will.  For you the world will continue to wear a noble, awful face.  You will never rise above mysticism....  But be happy in your own way.'  "Before I realised what he was doing, he jumped tranquilly from the path, down into the empty void.  He crashed with ever-increasing momentum toward the valley below.  I screeched, flung myself down on the ground, and shut my eyes.  "Often have I wondered which of my ill-considered, juvenile remarks it was that caused this sudden resolution on his part to commit suicide.  Whichever it might be, since then I have made it a rigid law never to speak for my own pleasure, but only to help others.  "I came eventually to the Marest.  I threaded its mazes in terror for four days.  I was frightened of death, but still more terrified at the possibility of losing my sacred attitude toward life.  When I was nearly through, and was beginning to congratulate myself, I stumbled across the third extraordinary personage of my experience--the grim Muremaker.  It was under horrible circumstances.  On an afternoon, cloudy and stormy, I saw, suspended in the air without visible support, a living man.  He was hanging in an upright position in front of a cliff--a yawning gulf, a thousand feet deep, lay beneath his feet.  I climbed as near as I could, and looked on.  He saw me, and made a wry grimace, like one who wishes to turn his humiliation into humour.  The spectacle so astounded me that I could not even grasp what had happened.  "'I am Muremaker,' he cried in a scraping voice which shocked my ears.  'All my life I have sorbed others--now I am sorbed.  Nuclamp and I fell out over a woman.  Now Nuclamp holds me up like this. While the strength of his will lasts I shall remain suspended; but when he gets tired--and it can't be long now--I drop into those depths.'  "Had it been another man, I would have tried to save him, but this ogre-like being was too well known to me as one who passed his whole existence in tormenting, murdering, and absorbing others, for the sake of his own delight.  I hurried away, and did not pause again that day.  "In Poolingdred I met Joiwind.  We walked and talked together for a month, and by that time we found that we loved each other too well to part."  Panawe stopped speaking.  "That is a fascinating story," remarked Maskull.  "Now I begin to know my way around better.  But one thing puzzles me."  "What's that?"  "How it happens that men here are ignorant of tools and arts, and have no civilisation, and yet contrive to be social in their habits and wise in their thoughts."  "Do you imagine, then, that love and wisdom spring from tools?  But I see how it arises.  In your world you have fewer sense organs, and to make up for the deficiency you have been obliged to call in the assistance of stones and metals.  That's by no means a sign of superiority."  "No, I suppose not," said Maskull, "but I see I have a great deal to unlearn."  They talked together a little longer, and then gradually fell asleep. Joiwind opened her eyes, smiled, and slumbered again.    Chapter 8  THE LUSION PLAIN  Maskull awoke before the others.  He got up, stretched himself, and walked out into the sunlight.  Branchspell was already declining.  He climbed to the top of the crater edge and looked away toward Ifdawn. The afterglow of Alppain had by now completely disappeared.  The mountains stood up wild and grand.  They impressed him like a simple musical theme, the notes of which are widely separated in the scale; a spirit of rashness, daring, and adventure seemed to call to him from them.  It was at that moment that the determination flashed into his heart to walk to the Marest and explore its dangers.  He returned to the cavern to say good-by to his hosts.  Joiwind looked at him with her brave and honest eyes.  "Is this selfishness, Maskull?" she asked, "or are you drawn by something stronger than yourself?"  "We must be reasonable," he answered, smiling.  "I can't settle down in Poolingdred before I have found out something about this surprising new planet of yours.  Remember what a long way I have come....  But very likely I shall come back here."  "Will you make me a promise?"  Maskull hesitated.  "Ask nothing difficult, for I hardly know my powers yet."  "It is not hard, and I wish it.  Promise this--never to raise your hand against a living creature, either to strike, pluck, or eat, without first recollecting its mother, who suffered for it."  "Perhaps I won't promise that," said Maskull slowly, "but I'll undertake something more tangible.  I will never lift my hand against a living creature without first recollecting you, Joiwind."  She turned a little pale.  "Now if Panawe knew that Panawe existed, he might be jealous."  Panawe put his hand on her gently.  "You would not talk like that in Shaping's presence," he said.  "No.  Forgive me!  I'm not quite myself.  Perhaps it is Maskull's. blood in my veins....  Now let us bid him adieu.  Let us pray that he will do only honourable deeds, wherever he may be."  "I'll set Maskull on his way," said Panawe.  "There's no need," replied Maskull.  "The way is plain."  "But talking shortens the road."  Maskull turned to go.  Joiwind pulled him around toward her softly.  "You won't think badly of other women on my account?"  "You are a blessed spirit," answered he.  She trod quietly to the inner extremity of the cave and stood there thinking.  Panawe and Maskull emerged into the open air. Halfway down the cliff face a little spring was encountered.  Its water was colourless, transparent, but gaseous.  As soon as Maskull had satisfied his thirst he felt himself different.  His surroundings were so real to him in their vividness and colour, so unreal in their phantom-like mystery, that he scrambled downhill like one in a winter's dream.  When they reached the plain he saw in front of them an interminable forest of tall trees, the shapes of which were extraordinarily foreign looking.  The leaves were crystalline and, looking upward, it was as if he were gazing through a roof of glass.  The moment they got underneath the trees the light rays of the sun continued to come through--white, savage, and blazing--but they were gelded of heat. Then it was not hard to imagine that they were wandering through cool, bright elfin glades.  Through the forest, beginning at their very feet an avenue, perfectly straight and not very wide, went forward as far as the eye could see.  Maskull wanted to talk to his travelling companion, but was somehow unable to find words.  Panawe glanced at him with an inscrutable smile--stern, yet enchanting and half feminine.  He then broke the silence, but, strangely enough, Maskull could not make out whether he was singing or speaking.  From his lips issued a slow musical recitative, exactly like a bewitching adagio from a low toned stringed instrument--but there was a difference.  Instead of the repetition and variation of one or two short themes, as in music, Panawe's theme was prolonged--it never came to an end, but rather resembled a conversation in rhythm and melody.  And, at the same time, it was no recitative, for it was not declamatory.  It was a long, quiet stream of lovely emotion.  Maskull listened entranced, yet agitated.  The song, if it might be termed song, seemed to be always just on the point of becoming clear and intelligible--not with the intelligibility of words, but in the way one sympathises with another's moods and feelings; and Maskull felt that something important was about to be uttered, which would explain all that had gone before.  But it was invariably postponed, he never understood--and yet somehow he did understand.  Late in the afternoon they came to a clearing, and there Panawe ceased his recitative.  He slowed his pace and stopped, in the fashion of a man who wishes to convey that he intends to go no farther.  "What is the name of this country?" asked Maskull.  "It is the Lusion Plain."  "Was that music in the nature of a temptation--do you wish me not to go on?"  "Your work lies before you, and not behind you."  "What was it, then?  What work do you allude to?"  "It must have seemed like something to you, Maskull."  "It seemed like Shaping music to me."  The instant he had absently uttered these words, Maskull wondered why he had done so, as they now appeared meaningless to him.  Panawe, however, showed no surprise.  "Shaping you will find everywhere."  "Am I dreaming, or awake?"  "You are awake."  Maskull fell into deep thought.  "So be it," he said, rousing himself.  "Now I will go on.  But where must I sleep tonight?"  "You will reach a broad river.  On that you can travel to the foot of the Marest tomorrow; but tonight you had better sleep where the forest and river meet."  "Adieu, then, Panawe!  But do you wish to say anything more to me?"  "Only this, Maskull--wherever you go, help to make the world beautiful, and not ugly."  "That's more than any of us can undertake.  I am a simple man, and have no ambitions in the way of beautifying life--But tell Joiwind I will try to keep myself pure."  They parted rather coldly.  Maskull stood erect where they had stopped, and watched Panawe out of sight.  He sighed more than once.  He became aware that something was about to happen.  The air was breathless.  The late-afternoon sunshine, unobstructed, wrapped his frame in voluptuous heat.  A solitary cloud, immensely high, raced through the sky overhead.  A single trumpet note sounded in the far distance from somewhere behind him.  It gave him an impression of being several miles away at first; but then it slowly swelled, and came nearer and nearer at the same time that it increased in volume.  Still the same note sounded, but now it was as if blown by a giant trumpeter immediately over his head.  Then it gradually diminished in force, and  travelled away in front of him.  It ended very faintly and distantly.  He felt himself alone with Nature.  A sacred stillness came over his heart.  Past and future were forgotten.  The forest, the sun, the day did not exist for him.  He was unconscious of himself--he had no thoughts and no feelings.  Yet never had Life had such an altitude for him.  A man stood, with crossed arms, right in his path.  He was so clothed that his limbs were exposed, while his body was covered.  He was young rather than old.  Maskull observed that his countenance possessed none of the special organs of Tormance, to which he had not even yet become reconciled.  He was smooth-faced.  His whole person seemed to radiate an excess of life, like the trembling of air on a hot day.  His eyes had such force that Maskull could not meet them.  He addressed Maskull by name, in an extraordinary voice.  It had a double tone.  The primary one sounded far away; the second was an undertone, like a sympathetic tanging string.  Maskull felt a rising joy, as he continued standing in the presence of this individual.  He believed that something good was happening to him.  He found it physically difficult to bring any words out.  "Why do you stop me?"  "Maskull, look well at me.  Who am I?"  "I think you are Shaping."  "I am Surtur."  Maskull again attempted to meet his eyes, but felt as if he were being stabbed.  "You know that this is my world.  Why do you think I have brought you here?  I wish you to serve me."  Maskull could no longer speak.  "Those who joke at my world," continued the vision, "those who make a mock of its stern, eternal rhythm, its beauty and sublimity, which are not skin-deep, but proceed from fathomless roots--they shall not escape."  "I do not mock it."  "Ask me your questions, and I will answer them."  "I have nothing."  "It is necessary for you to serve me,  Maskull.  Do you not understand?  You are my servant and helper."  "I shall not fail."  "This is for my sake, and not for yours."  These last words had no sooner left Surtur's mouth than Maskull saw him spring suddenly upward and outward.  Looking up at the vault of the sky, he saw the whole expanse of vision filled by Surtur's form-- not as a concrete man, but as a vast, concave cloud image, looking down and frowning at him.  Then the spectacle vanished, as a light goes out.  Maskull stood inactive, with a thumping heart.  Now he again heard the solitary trumpet note.  The sound began this time faintly in the far distance in front of him, travelled slowly toward him with regularly increasing intensity, passed overhead at its loudest, and then grew more and more quiet, wonderful, and solemn, as it fell away in the rear, until the note was merged in the deathlike silence of the forest.  It appeared to Maskull like the closing of a marvellous and important chapter.  Simultaneously with the fading away of the sound, the heavens seemed to open up with the rapidity of lightning into a blue vault of immeasurable height.  He breathed a great breath, stretched all his limbs, and looked around him with a slow smile.  After a while he resumed his journey.  His brain was all dark and confused, but one idea was already beginning to stand out from the rest--huge, shapeless, and grand, like the growing image in the soul of a creative artist: the staggering thought that he was a man of destiny.  The more he reflected upon all that had occurred since his arrival in this new world--and even before leaving Earth--the clearer and more indisputable it became, that he could not be here for his own purposes, but must be here for an end.  But what that end was, he could not imagine.  Through the forest he saw Branchspell at last sinking in the west. It looked a stupendous ball of red fire--now he could realise at his ease what a sun it was!  The avenue took an abrupt turn to the left and began to descend steeply.  A wide, rolling river of clear and dark water was visible in front of him, no great way off.  It flowed from north to south.  The forest path led him straight to its banks.  Maskull stood there, and regarded the lapping, gurgling waters pensively.  On the opposite bank, the forest continued.  Miles to the south, Poolingdred could just be distinguished.  On the northern skyline the Ifdawn Mountains loomed up--high, wild, beautiful, and dangerous.  They were not a dozen miles away.  Like the first mutterings of a thunderstorm, the first faint breaths of cool wind, Maskull felt the stirrings of passion in his heart.  In spite of his bodily fatigue, he in wished to test his strength against something.  This craving he identified with the crags of the Marest.  They seemed to have the same magical attraction for his will as the lodestone for iron.  He kept biting his nails, as he turned his eyes in that direction--wondering if it would not be possible to conquer the heights that evening.  But when he glanced back again at Poolingdred, he remembered Joiwind and Panawe, and grew more tranquil.  He decided to make his bed at this spot, and to set off as soon after daybreak as he should awake.  He drank at the river, washed himself, and lay down on the bank to sleep.  By this time, so far had his idea progressed, that he cared nothing for the possible dangers of the night--he confided in his star.  Branchspell set, the day faded, night with its terrible weight came on, and through it all Maskull slept.  Long before midnight, however, he was awakened by a crimson glow in the sky.  He opened his eyes, and wondered where he was.  He felt heaviness and pain.  The red glow was a terrestrial phenomenon; it came from among the trees.  He got up and went toward the source of the light.  Away from the river, not a hundred feet off, he nearly stumbled across the form of a sleeping woman.  The object which emitted the crimson rays was lying on the ground, several yards away from her. It was like a small jewel, throwing off sparks of red light.  He barely threw a glance at that, however.  The woman was clothed in the large skin of an animal.  She had big, smooth, shapely limbs, rather muscular than fat.  Her magn was not a thin tentacle, but a third arm, terminating in a hand.  Her face, which was upturned, was wild, powerful, and exceedingly handsome. But he saw with surprise that in place of a breve on her forehead, she possessed another eye.  All three were closed.  The colour of her skin in the crimson glow he could not distinguish.  He touched her gently with his hand.  She awoke calmly and looked up at him without stirring a muscle.  All three eyes stared at him; but the two lower ones were dull and vacant--mere carriers of vision. The middle, upper one alone expressed her inner nature.  Its haughty, unflinching glare had yet something seductive and alluring in it. Maskull felt a challenge in that look of lordly, feminine will, and his manner instinctively stiffened.  She sat up.  "Can you speak my language?" he asked.  "I wouldn't put such a question, but others have been able to."  "Why should you imagine that I can't read your mind?  Is it so extremely complex?"  She spoke in a rich, lingering, musical voice, which delighted him to listen to.  "No, but you have no breve."  "Well, but haven't I a sorb, which is better?"  And she pointed to the eye on her brow.  "What is your name?"  "Oceaxe."  "And where do you come from?"  "Ifdawn."  These contemptuous replies began to irritate him, and yet the mere sound of her voice was fascinating.  "I am going there tomorrow," he remarked.  She laughed, as if against her will, but made no comment.  "My name is Maskull," he went on.  "I am a stranger--from another world."  "So I should judge, from your absurd appearance."  "Perhaps it would be as well to say at once," said Maskull bluntly, "are we, or are we not, to be friends?"  She yawned and stretched her arms, without rising.  "Why should we be friends?  If I thought you were a man, I might accept you as a lover."  "You must look elsewhere for that."  "So be it, Maskull!  Now go away, and leave me in peace."  She dropped her head again to the ground, but did not at once close her eyes.  "What are you doing here?" he interrogated.  "Oh, we Ifdawn folk occasionally come here to sleep, for there often enough it is a night for us which has no next morning."  "Being such a terrible place, and seeing that I am a total stranger, it would be merely courteous if you were to warn me what I have to expect in the way of dangers."  "I am perfectly and utterly indifferent to what becomes of you," retorted Oceaxe.  "Are you returning in the morning?" persisted Maskull.  "If I wish."  "Then we will go together."  She got up again on her elbow.  "Instead of making plans for other people, I would do a very necessary thing."  "Pray, tell me."  "Well, there's no reason why I should, but I will.  I would try to convert my women's organs into men's organs.  It is a man's country."  "Speak more plainly."  "Oh, it's plain enough.  If you attempt to pass through Ifdawn without a sorb, you are simply committing suicide.  And that magn too is worse than useless."  "You probably know what you are talking about, Oceaxe.  But what do you advise me to do?"  She negligently pointed to the light-emitting stone lying on the ground.  "There is the solution.  If you hold that drude to your organs for a good while, perhaps it will start the change, and perhaps nature will do the rest during the night.  I promise nothing."  Oceaxe now really turned her back on Maskull.  He considered for a few minutes, and then walked over and to where the stone was lying, and took it in his hand.  It was a pebble the size of a hen's egg, radiant with crimson light, as though red-hot, and throwing out a continuous shower of small, blood-red sparks.  Finally deciding that Oceaxe's advice was good, he applied the drude first to his magn, and then to his breve.  He experienced a cauterising sensation--a feeling of healing pain.    Chapter 9  OCEAXE  Maskull's second day on Tormance dawned.  Branchspell was already above the horizon when he awoke.  He was instantly aware that his organs had changed during the night.  His fleshy breve was altered into an eyelike sorb; his magn had swelled and developed into a third arm, springing from the breast.  The arm gave him at once a sense of greater physical security, but with the sorb he was obliged to experiment, before he could grasp its function.  As he lay there in the white sunlight, opening and shutting each of his three eyes in turn, he found that the two lower ones served his understanding, the upper one his will.  That is to say, with the lower eyes he saw things in clear detail, but without personal interest; with the sorb he saw nothing as self-existent-- everything appeared as an object of importance or non-importance to his own needs.  Rather puzzled as to how this would turn out, he got up and looked about him.  He had slept out of sight of Oceaxe.  He was anxious to learn if she were still on the spot, but before going to ascertain he made up his mind to bathe in the river.  It was a glorious morning.  The hot white sun already began to glare, but its heat was tempered by a strong wind, which whistled through the trees.  A host of fantastic clouds filled the sky.  They looked like animals, and were always changing shape.  The ground, as well as the leaves and branches of the forest trees, still held traces of heavy dew or rain during the night.  A poignantly sweet smell of nature entered his nostrils.  His pain was quiescent, and his spirits were high.  Before he bathed, he viewed the mountains of the Ifdawn Marest.  In the morning sunlight they stood out pictorially.  He guessed that they were from five to six thousand feet high.  The lofty, irregular, castellated line seemed like the walls of a magic city.  The cliffs fronting him were composed of gaudy rocks--vermilion, emerald, yellow, ulfire, and black.  As he gazed at them, his heart began to beat like a slow, heavy drum, and he thrilled all over-- indescribable hopes, aspirations, and emotions came over him.  It was more than the conquest of a new world which he felt--it was something different....  He bathed and drank, and as he was reclothing himself, Oceaxe strolled indolently up.  He could now perceive the colour of her skin--it was a vivid, yet delicate mixture of carmine, white, and jale.  The effect was startlingly unearthly.  With these new colors she looked like a genuine representative of a strange planet.  Her frame also had something curious about it.  The curves were womanly, the bones were characteristically female--yet all seemed somehow to express a daring, masculine underlying will.  The commanding eye on her forehead set the same puzzle in plainer language.  Its bold, domineering egotism was shot with undergleams of sex and softness.  She came to the river's edge and reviewed him from top to toe.  "Now you are built more like a man," she said, in her lovely, lingering voice.  "You see, the experiment was successful," he answered, smiling gaily.  Oceaxe continued looking him over.  "Did some woman give you that ridiculous robe?"  "A woman did give it to me"--dropping his smile--"but I saw nothing ridiculous in the gift at the time, and I don't now."  "I think I'd look better in it."  As she drawled the words, she began stripping off the skin, which suited her form so well, and motioned to him to exchange garments. He obeyed, rather shamefacedly, for he realised that the proposed exchange was in fact more appropriate to his sex.  He found the skin a freer dress.  Oceaxe in her drapery appeared more dangerously feminine to him.  "I don't want you to receive gifts at all from other women," she remarked slowly.  "Why not?  What can I be to you?"  "I have been thinking about you during the night."  Her voice was retarded, scornful, viola-like.  She sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree, and looked away.  "In what way?"  She returned no answer to his question, but began to pull off pieces of the bark.  "Last night you were so contemptuous."  "Last night is not today.  Do you always walk through the world with your head over your shoulder?"  It was now Maskull's turn to be silent.  "Still, if you have male instincts, as I suppose you have, you can't go on resisting me forever."  "But this is preposterous" said Maskull, opening his eyes wide. "Granted that you are a beautiful woman--we can't be quite so primeval."  Oceaxe sighed, and rose to her feet.  "It doesn't matter.  I can wait."  "From that I gather that you intend to make the journey in my society.  I have no objection--in fact I shall be glad--but only on condition that you drop this language."  "Yet you do think me beautiful?"  "Why shouldn't I think so, if it is the fact?  I fail to see what that has to do with my feelings.  Bring it to an end, Oceaxe.  You will find plenty of men to admire--and love you."  At that she blazed up.  "Does love pick and choose, you fool?  Do you imagine I am so hard put to it that I have to hunt for lovers?  Is not Crimtyphon waiting for me at this very moment?"  "Very well.  I am sorry to have hurt your feelings.  Now carry the temptation no farther--for it is a temptation, where a lovely woman is concerned.  I am not my own master."  "I'm not proposing anything so very hateful, am I?  Why do you humiliate me so?"  Maskull put his hands behind his back.  "I repeat, I am not my own master."  "Then who is your master?"  "Yesterday I saw Surtur, and from today I am serving him."  "Did you speak with him?" she asked curiously.  "I did."  "Tell me what he said."  "No, I can't--I won't.  But whatever he said, his beauty was more tormenting than yours, Oceaxe, and that's why I can look at you in cold blood."  "Did Surtur forbid you to be a man?"  Maskull frowned.  "Is love such a manly sport, then?  I should have thought it effeminate."  "It doesn't matter.  You won't always be so boyish.  But don't try my patience too far."  "Let us talk about something else--and, above all, let us get on our road."  She suddenly broke into a laugh, so rich, sweet, and enchanting, that he grew half inflamed, and half wished to catch her body in his arms. "Oh, Maskull, Maskull--what a fool you are!"  "In what way am I a fool?" he demanded, scowling not at her words, but at his own weakness.  "Isn't the whole world the handiwork of innumerable pairs of lovers? And yet you think yourself above all that.  You try to fly away from nature, but where will you find a hole to hide yourself in?"  "Besides beauty, I now credit you with a second quality: persistence."  "Read me well, and then it is natural law that you'll think twice and three times before throwing me away....  And now, before we go, we had better eat."  "Eat?" said Maskull thoughtfully.  "Don't you eat?  Is food in the same category as love?"  "What food is it?"  "Fish from the river."  Maskull recollected his promise to Joiwind.  At the same time, he felt hungry.  "Is there nothing milder?"  She pulled her mouth scornfully.  "You came through Poolingdred, didn't you?  All the people there are the same.  They think life is to be looked at, and not lived.  Now that you are visiting Ifdawn, you will have to change your notions."  "Go catch your fish," he returned, pulling down his brows.  The broad, clear waters flowed past them with swelling undulations, from the direction of the mountains.  Oceaxe knelt down on the bank, and peered into the depths.  Presently her look became tense and concentrated; she dipped her hand in and pulled out some sort of little monster.  It was more like a reptile than a fish, with its scaly plates and teeth.  She threw it on the ground, and it started crawling about.  Suddenly she darted all her will into her sorb.  The creature leaped into the air, and fell down dead.  She picked up a sharp-edged slate, and with it removed the scales and entrails.  During this operation, her hands and garment became stained with the light scarlet blood.  "Find the drude, Maskull," she said, with a lazy smile.  "You had it last night."  He searched for it.  It was hard to locate, for its rays had grown dull and feeble in the sunlight, but at last he found it.  Oceaxe placed it in the interior of the monster, and left the body lying on the ground.  "While it's cooking, I'll wash some of this blood away, which frightens you so much.  Have you never seen blood before?"  Maskull gazed at her in perplexity.  The old paradox came back--the contrasting sexual characteristics in her person.  Her bold, masterful, masculine egotism of manner seemed quite incongruous with the fascinating and disturbing femininity of her voice.  A startling idea flashed into his mind.  "In your country I'm told there is an act of will called 'absorbing.' What is that?"  She held her red, dripping hands away from her draperies, and uttered a delicious, clashing laugh.  "You think I am half a man?"  "Answer my question."  "I'm a woman through and through, Maskull--to the marrowbone.  But that's not to say I have never absorbed males."  "And that means..."  "New strings for my harp, Maskull.  A wider range of passions, a stormier heart..."  "For you, yes--But for them?..."  "I don't know.  The victims don't describe their experiences. Probably unhappiness of some sort--if they still know anything."  "This is a fearful business!" he exclaimed, regarding her gloomily. "One would think Ifdawn a land of devils."  Oceaxe gave a beautiful sneer as she took a step toward the river. "Better men than you--better in every sense of the word--are walking about with foreign wills inside them.  You may be as moral as you like, Maskull, but the fact remains, animals were made to be eaten, and simple natures were made to be absorbed."  "And human rights count for nothing!"  She had bent over the river's edge, to wash her arms and hands, but glanced up over her shoulder to answer his remark.  "They do count. But we only regard a man as human for just as long as he's able to hold his own with others."  The flesh was soon cooked, and they breakfasted in silence.  Maskull cast heavy, doubtful glances from time to time toward his companion. Whether it was due to the strange quality of the food, or to his long abstention, he did not know, but the meal tasted nauseous, and even cannibalistic.  He ate little, and the moment he got up he felt defiled.  "Let me bury this drude, where I can find it some other time," said Oceaxe.  "On the next occasion, though, I shall have no Maskull with me, to shock....  Now we have to take to the river."  They stepped off the land onto the water.  It flowed against them with a sluggish current, but the opposition, instead of hindering them, had the contrary effect--it caused them to exert themselves, and they moved faster.  They climbed the river in this way for several miles.  The exercise gradually improved the circulation of Maskull's blood, and he began to look at things in a far more way. The hot sunshine, the diminished wind, the cheerful marvellous cloud scenery, the quiet, crystal forests--all was soothing and delightful. They approached nearer and  nearer to the gaily painted heights of Ifdawn.  There was something enigmatic to him in those bright walls.  He was attracted by them, yet felt a sort of awe.  They looked real, but at the same time very supernatural.  If one could see the portrait of a ghost, painted with a hard, firm outline, in substantial colors, the feelings produced by such a sight would be exactly similar to Maskull's impressions as he studied the Ifdawn precipices.  He broke the long silence.  "Those mountains have most extraordinary shapes.  All the lines are straight and perpendicular--no slopes or curves."  She walked backward on the water, in order to face him.  "That's typical of Ifdawn.  Nature is all hammer blows with us.  Nothing soft and gradual."  "I hear you, but I don't understand you."  "All over the Marest you'll find patches of ground plunging down or rushing up.  Trees grow fast.  Women and men don't think twice before acting.  One may call Ifdawn a place of quick decisions."  Maskull was impressed.  "A fresh, wild, primitive land."  "How is it where you come from?" asked Oceaxe.  "Oh, mine is a decrepit world, where nature takes a hundred years to move a foot of solid land.  Men and animals go about in flocks. Originality is a lost habit."  "Are there women there?"  "As with you, and not very differently formed."  "Do they love?"  He laughed.  "So much so that it has changed the dress, speech, and thoughts of the whole sex."  "Probably they are more beautiful than I?"  "No, I think not," said Maskull.  There was another rather long silence, as they travelled unsteadily onward.  "What is your business in Ifdawn?" demanded Oceaxe suddenly.  He hesitated over his answer.  "Can you grasp that it's possible to have an aim right in front of one, so big that one can't see it as a whole?"  She stole a long, inquisitive look at him, "What sort of aim?"  "A moral aim."  "Are you proposing to set the world right?"  "I propose nothing--I am waiting."  "Don't wait too long, for time doesn't wait--especially in Ifdawn."  "Something will happen," said Maskull.  Oceaxe threw a subtle smile.  "So you have no special destination in the Marest?"  "No, and if you'll permit me, I will come home with you."  "Singular man!" she said, with a short, thrilling laugh.  "That's what I have been offering all the time.  Of course you will come home with me.  As for Crimtyphon..."  "You mentioned that name before.  Who is he?"  "Oh!  My lover, or, as you would say, my husband."  "This doesn't improve matters," said Maskull.  "It leaves them exactly where they were.  We merely have to remove him."  "We are certainly misunderstanding each other," said Maskull, quite startled.  "Do you by any chance imagine that I am making a compact with you?"  "You will do nothing against your will.  But you have promised to come home with me."  "Tell me, how do you remove husbands in Ifdawn?"  "Either you or I must kill him."  He eyed her for a full minute.  "Now we are passing from folly to insanity."  "Not at all," replied Oceaxe.  "It is the too-sad truth.  And when you have seen Crimtyphon, you will realise it."  "I'm aware I am on a strange planet," said Maskull slowly, "where all sorts of unheard of things may happen, and where the very laws of morality may be different.  Still as far as I am concerned, murder is murder, and I'll have no more to do with a woman who wants to make use of me, to get rid of her husband."  "You think me wicked?" demanded Oceaxe steadily.  "Or mad."  "Then you had better leave me, Maskull--only--"  "Only what?"  "You wish to be consistent, don't you?  Leave all other mad and wicked people as well.  Then you'll find it easier to reform the rest."  Maskull frowned, but said nothing.  "Well?" demanded Oceaxe, with a half smile.  "I'll come with you, and I'll see Crimtyphon--if only to warn him."  Oceaxe broke into a cascade of rich, feminine laughter, but whether at the image conjured up by Maskull's last words, or from some other cause, he did not know.  The conversation dropped.  At a distance of a couple of miles from the now towering cliffs, the river made a sharp, right-angled turn to the west, and was no longer of use to them on their journey.  Maskull stared up doubtfully.  "It's a stiff climb for a hot morning."  "Let's rest here a little," said she, indicating a smooth flat island of black rock, standing up just out of the water in the middle of the river.  They accordingly went to it, and Maskull sat down.  Oceaxe, however, standing graceful and erect, turned her face toward the cliffs opposite, and uttered a piercing and peculiar call.  "What is that for?"  She did not answer.  After waiting a minute, she repeated the call.  Maskull now saw a large bird detach itself from the top of one of the precipices, and sail slowly down toward them. It was followed by two others.  The flight of these birds was exceedingly slow and clumsy.  "What are they?" he asked.  She still returned no answer, but smiled rather peculiarly and sat down beside him.  Before many minutes he was able to distinguish the shapes and colors of the flying monsters.  They were not birds, but creatures with long, snakelike bodies, and ten reptilian legs apiece, terminating in fins which acted as wings.  The bodies were of bright blue, the legs and fins were yellow.  They were flying, without haste, but in a somewhat ominous fashion, straight toward them.  He could make out a long, thin spike projecting from each of the heads.  "They are shrowks," explained Oceaxe at last.  "If you want to know their intention, I'll tell you.  To make a meal of us.  First of all their spikes will pierce us, and then their mouths, which are really suckers, will drain us dry of blood--pretty thoroughly too; there are no half measures with shrowks.  They are toothless beasts, so don't eat flesh."  "As you show such admirable sangfroid," said Maskull dryly, "I take it there's no particular danger."  Nevertheless he instinctively tried to get on to his feet and failed. A new form of paralysis was chaining him to the ground.  "Are you trying to get up?" asked Oceaxe smoothly.  "Well, yes, but those cursed reptiles seem to be nailing me down to the rock with their wills.  May I ask if you had any special object in view in waking them up?"  "I assure you the danger is quite real, Maskull.  Instead of talking and asking questions, you had much better see what you can do with your will."  "I seem to have no will, unfortunately."  Oceaxe was seized with a paroxysm of laughter, but it was still rich and beautiful.  "It's obvious you aren't a very heroic protector, Maskull.  It seems I must play the man, and you the woman.  I expected better things of your big body.  Why, my husband would send those creatures dancing all around the sky, by way of a joke, before disposing of them.  Now watch me.. Two of the three I'll kill; the third we will ride home on.  Which one shall we keep?"  The shrowks continued their slow, wobbling flight toward them.  Their bodies were of huge size.  They produced in Maskull the same sensation of loathing as insects did.  He instinctively understood that as they hunted with their wills, there was no necessity for them to possess a swift motion.  "Choose which you please," he said shortly.  "They are equally objectionable to me."  "Then I'll choose the leader, as it is presumably the most energetic animal.  Watch now."  She stood upright, and her sorb suddenly blazed with fire.  Maskull felt something snap inside his brain.  His limbs were free once more. The two monsters in the rear staggered and darted head foremost toward the earth, one after the other.  He watched them crash on the ground, and then lie motionless.  The leader still came toward them, but he fancied that its flight was altered in character; it was no longer menacing, but tame and unwilling.  Oceaxe guided it with her will to the mainland shore opposite their island rock.  Its vast bulk lay there extended, awaiting her pleasure.  They immediately crossed the water.  Maskull viewed the shrowk at close quarters.  It was about thirty feet long.  Its bright-coloured skin was shining, slippery, and leathery; a mane of black hair covered its long neck.  Its face was awesome and unnatural, with its carnivorous eyes, frightful stiletto, and blood-sucking cavity.  There were true fins on its back and tail.  "Have you a good seat?" asked Oceaxe, patting the creature's flank. "As I have to steer, let me jump on first."  She pulled up her gown, then climbed up and sat astride the animal's back, just behind the mane, which she clutched.  Between her and the fin there was just room for Maskull.  He grasped the two flanks with his outer hands; his third, new arm pressed against Oceaxe's back, and for additional security he was compelled to encircle her waist with it.  Directly he did so, he realised that he had been tricked, and that this ride had been planned for one purpose only--to inflame his desires.  The third arm possessed a function of its own, of which hitherto he had been ignorant.  It was a developed magn.  But the stream of love which was communicated to it was no longer pure and noble--it was boiling, passionate, and torturing.  He gritted his teeth, and kept quiet, but Oceaxe had not plotted the adventure to remain unconscious of his feelings.  She looked around, with a golden, triumphant smile. "The ride will last some time, so hold on well!"  Her voice was soft like a flute, but rather malicious.  Maskull grinned, and said nothing.  He dared not remove his arm.  The shrowk straddled on to its legs.  It jerked itself forward, and rose slowly and uncouthly in the air.  They began to paddle upward toward the painted cliffs.  The motion was swaying, rocking, and sickening; the contact of the brute's slimy skin was disgusting.  All this, however, was merely, background to Maskull, as he sat there with closed eyes, holding on to Oceaxe.  In the front and centre of his consciousness was the knowledge that he was gripping a fair woman, and that her flesh was responding to his touch like a lovely harp.  They climbed up and up.  He opened his eyes, and ventured to look around him.  By this time they were already level with the top of the outer rampart of precipices.  There now came in sight a wild archipelago of islands, with jagged outlines, emerging from a sea of air.  The islands were mountain summits; or, more accurately speaking, the country was a high tableland, fissured everywhere by narrow and apparently bottomless cracks.  These cracks were in some cases like canals, in others like lakes, in others merely holes in the ground, closed in all round.  The perpendicular sides of the islands--that is, the upper, visible parts of the innumerable cliff faces--were of bare rock, gaudily coloured; but the level surfaces were a tangle of wild plant life.  The taller trees alone were distinguishable from the shrowk's back.  They were of different shapes, and did not look ancient; they were slender and swaying but did not appear very graceful; they looked tough, wiry, and savage.  As Maskull continued to explore the landscape, he forgot Oceaxe and his passion.  Other strange feelings came to the front.  The morning was gay and bright.  The sun scorched down, quickly-changing clouds sailed across the sky, the earth was vivid, wild, and lonely.  Yet he experienced no aesthetic sensations--he felt nothing but an intense longing for action and possession.  When he looked at anything, he immediately wanted to deal with it.  The atmosphere of the land seemed not free, but sticky; attraction and repulsion were its constituents.  Apart from this wish to play a personal part in what was going on around and beneath him, the scenery had no significance for him.  So preoccupied was he, that his arm partly released its clasp.  Oceaxe turned around to gaze at him.  Whether or not she was satisfied with what she saw, she uttered a low laugh, like a peculiar chord.  "Cold again so quickly, Maskull?"  "What do you want?" he asked absently, still looking over the side. "It's extraordinary how drawn I feel to all this."  "You wish to take a hand?"  "I wish to get down."  "Oh, we have a good way to go yet....  So you really feel different?"  "Different from what?  What are you talking about?" said Maskull, still lost in abstraction.  Oceaxe laughed again.  "It would be strange if we couldn't make a man of you, for the material is excellent."  After that, she turned her back once more.  The air islands differed from water islands in another way.  They were not on a plane surface, but sloped upward, like a succession of broken terraces, as the journey progressed.  The shrowk had hitherto been flying well above the ground; but now, when a new line of towering cliffs confronted them, Oceaxe did not urge the beast upward, but caused it to enter a narrow canyon, which intersected the mountains like a channel.  They were instantly plunged into deep shade.  The canal was not above thirty feet wide; the walls stretched upward on both sides for many hundred feet.  It was as cool as an ice chamber.  When Maskull attempted to plumb the chasm with his eyes, he saw nothing but black obscurity.  "What is at the bottom?" he asked.  "Death for you, if you go to look for it."  "We know that.  I mean, is there any kind of life down there?"  "Not that I have ever heard of," said Oceaxe, "but of course all things are possible."  "I think very likely there is life," he returned thoughtfully.  Her ironical laugh sounded out of the gloom.  "Shall we go down and see?"  "You find that amusing?"  "No, not that.  What I do find amusing is the big stranger with the beard, who is so keenly interested in everything except himself."  Maskull then laughed too.  "I happen to be the only thing in Tormance which is not a novelty for me."  "Yes, but I am a novelty for you."  The channel went zigzagging its way through the belly of the mountain, and all the time they were gradually rising.  "At least I have heard nothing like your voice before," said Maskull, who, since he had no longer anything to look at, was at last ready for conversation.  "What's the matter with my voice?"  "It's all that I can distinguish of you now; that's why I mentioned it."  "Isn't it clear--don't I speak distinctly?"  "Oh, it's clear enough, but--it's inappropriate."  "Inappropriate?"  "I won't explain further," said Maskull, "but whether you are speaking or laughing, your voice is by far the loveliest and strangest instrument I have ever listened to.  And yet I repeat, it is inappropriate."  "You mean that my nature doesn't correspond?"  He was just considering his reply, when their talk was abruptly broken off by a huge and terrifying, but not very loud sound rising up from the gulf directly underneath them.  It was a low, grinding, roaring thunder.  "The ground is rising under us!" cried Oceaxe.  "Shall we escape?"  She made no answer, but urged the shrowk's flight upward, at such a steep gradient that they retained their seats with difficulty.  The floor of the canyon, upheaved by some mighty subterranean force, could be heard, and almost felt, coming up after them, like a gigantic landslip in the wrong direction.  The cliffs cracked, and fragments began to fall.  A hundred awful noises filled the air, growing louder and louder each second--splitting, hissing, cracking, grinding, booming, exploding, roaring.  When they had still fifty feet or so to go, to reach the top, a sort of dark, indefinite sea of broken rocks and soil appeared under their feet, ascending rapidly, with irresistible might, accompanied by the most horrible noises. The canal was filled up for two hundred yards, before and behind them.  Millions of tons of solid matter seemed to be raised.  The shrowk in its ascent was caught by the uplifted debris.  Beast and riders experienced in that moment all the horrors of an earthquake-- they were rolled violently over, and thrown among the rocks and dirt. All was thunder, instability, motion, confusion.  Before they had time to realise their position, they were in the sunlight.  The upheaval still continued.  In another minute or two the valley floor had formed a new mountain, a hundred feet or more higher than the old.  Then its movement ceased suddenly.  Every noise stopped, as if by magic; not a rock moved.  Oceaxe and Maskull picked themselves up and examined themselves for cuts and bruises.  The shrowk lay on its side, panting violently, and sweating with fright.  "That was a nasty affair," said Maskull, flicking the dirt off his person.  Oceaxe staunched a cut on her chin with a corner of her robe.  "It might have been far worse....  I mean, it's bad enough to come up, but it's death to go down, and that happens just as often."  "Whatever induces you to live in such a country?"  "I don't know, Maskull.  Habit, I suppose.  I have often thought of moving out of it."  "A good deal must be forgiven you for having to spend your life in a place like this, where one is obviously never safe from one minute to another."  "You will learn by degrees," she answered, smiling.  She looked hard at the monster, and it got heavily to its feet.  "Get on again, Maskull!" she directed, climbing back to her perch. "We haven't too much time to waste."  He obeyed.  They resumed their interrupted flight, this time over the mountains, and in full sunlight.  Maskull settled down again to his thoughts.  The peculiar atmosphere of the country continued to soak into his brain.  His will became so restless and uneasy that merely to sit there in inactivity was a torture.  He could scarcely endure not to be doing something.  "How secretive you are, Maskull!" said Oceaxe quietly, without turning her head.  "What secrets--what do you mean?"  "Oh, I know perfectly well what's passing inside you.  Now I think it wouldn't be amiss to ask you--is friendship still enough?"  "Oh, don't ask me anything," growled Maskull.  "I've far too many problems in my head already.  I only wish I could answer some of them."  He stared stonily at the landscape.  The beast was winging its way toward a distant mountain, of singular shape.  It was an enormous natural quadrilateral pyramid, rising in great terraces and terminating in a broad, flat top, on which what looked like green snow still lingered.  "What mountain is that?" he asked.  "Disscourn.  The highest point in Ifdawn."  "Are we going there?"  "Why should we go there?  But if you were going on farther, it might be worth your while to pay a visit to the top.  It commands the whole land as far as the Sinking Sea and Swaylone's Island--and beyond. You can also see Alppain from it."  "That's a sight I mean to see before I have finished."  "Do you, Maskull?"  She turned around and put her hand on his wrist. "Stay with me, and one day we'll go to Disscourn together."  He grunted unintelligibly.  There were no signs of human existence in the country under their feet.  While Maskull was still grimly regarding it, a large tract of forest not far ahead, bearing many trees and rocks, suddenly subsided with an awful roar and crashed down into an invisible gulf.  What was solid land one minute became a clean-cut chasm the next.  He jumped violently up with the shock.  "This is frightful."  Oceaxe remained unmoved.  "Why, life here must be absolutely impossible," he went on, when he had somewhat recovered himself.  "A man would need nerves of steel.... Is there no means at all of foreseeing a catastrophe like this?"  "Oh, I suppose we wouldn't be alive if there weren't," replied Oceaxe, with composure.  "We are more or less clever at it--but that doesn't prevent our often getting caught."  "You had better teach me the signs."  "We'll have many things to go over together.  And among them, I expect, will be whether we are to stay in the land at all....  But first let us get home."  "How far is it now?"  "It is right in front of you," said Oceaxe, pointing with her forefinger.  "You can see it."  He followed the direction of the finger and, after a few questions, made out the spot she was indicating.  It was a broad peninsula, about two miles distant.  Three of its sides rose sheer out of a lake of air, the bottom of which was invisible; its fourth was a bottleneck, joining it to the mainland.  It was overgrown with bright vegetation, distinct in the brilliant atmosphere.  A single tall tree, shooting up in the middle of the peninsula, dwarfed everything else; it was wide and shady with sea-green leaves.  "I wonder if Crimtyphon is there," remarked Oceaxe.  "Can I see two figures, or am I mistaken?"  "I also see something," said Maskull.  In twenty minutes they were directly above the peninsula, at a height of about fifty feet.  The shrowk slackened speed, and came to earth on the mainland, exactly at the gateway of the isthmus.  They both descended--Maskull with aching thighs.  "What shall we do with the monster?" asked Oceaxe.  Without waiting for a suggestion, she patted its hideous face with her hand.  "Fly away home!  I may want you some other time."  It gave a stupid grunt, elevated itself on its legs again, and, after half running, half flying for a few yards, rose awkwardly into the air, and paddled away in the same direction from which they had come. They watched it out of sight, and then Oceaxe started to cross the neck of land, followed by Maskull.  Branchspell's white rays beat down on them with pitiless force.  The sky had by degrees become cloudless, and the wind had dropped entirely.  The ground was a rich riot of vividly coloured ferns, shrubs, and grasses.  Through these could be seen here and there the golden chalky soil--and occasionally a glittering, white metallic boulder.  Everything looked extraordinary and barbaric.  Maskull was at last walking in the weird Ifdawn Marest which had created such strange feelings in him when seen from a distance....  And now he felt no wonder or curiosity at all, but only desired to meet human beings-- so intense had grown his will.  He longed to test his powers on his fellow creatures, and nothing else seemed of the least importance to him.  On the peninsula all was coolness and delicate shade.  It resembled a large copse, about two acres in extent.  In the heart of the tangle of small trees and undergrowth was a partially cleared space-- perhaps the roots of the giant tree growing in the centre had killed off the smaller fry all around it.  By the side of the tree sparkled a little, bubbling fountain, whose water was iron-red.  The precipices on all sides, overhung with thorns, flowers, and creepers, invested the enclosure with an air of wild and charming seclusion--a mythological mountain god might have dwelt here.  Maskull's restless eye left everything, to fall on the two men who formed the centre of the picture.  One was reclining, in the ancient Grecian fashion of banqueters on a tall couch of mosses, sprinkled with flowers; he rested on one arm, and was eating a kind of plum, with calm enjoyment.  A pile of these plums lay on the couch beside him.  The over-spreading branches of the tree completely sheltered him from the sun.  His small, boyish form was clad in a rough skin, leaving his limbs naked.  Maskull could not tell from his face whether he were a young boy or a grown man.  The features were smooth, soft, and childish, their expression was seraphically tranquil; but his violet upper eye was sinister and adult.  His skin was of the colour of yellow ivory.  His long, curling hair matched his sorb--it was violet.  The second man was standing erect before the other, a few feet away from him.  He was short and muscular, his face was broad, bearded, and rather commonplace, but there was something terrible about his appearance. The features were distorted by a deep-seated look of pain, despair, and horror.  Oceaxe, without pausing, strolled lightly and lazily up to the outermost shadows of the tree, some distance from the couch.  "We have met with an uplift," she remarked carelessly, looking toward the youth.  He eyed her, but said nothing.  "How is your plant man getting on?"  Her tone was artificial but extremely beautiful.  While waiting for an answer, she sat down on the ground, her legs gracefully thrust under her body, and pulled down the skirt of her robe.  Maskull remained standing just behind her, with crossed arms.  There was silence for a minute.  "Why don't you answer your mistress, Sature?" said the boy on the couch, in a calm, treble voice.  The man addressed did not alter his expression, but replied in a strangled tone, "I am getting on very well, Oceaxe.  There are already buds on my feet.  Tomorrow I hope to take root."  Maskull felt a rising storm inside him.  He was perfectly aware that although these words were uttered by Sature, they were being dictated by the boy.  "What he says is quite true," remarked the latter.  "Tomorrow roots will reach the ground, and in a few days they ought to be well established.  Then I shall set to work to convert his arms into branches, and his fingers into leaves.  It will take longer to transform his head into a crown, but still I hope--in fact I can almost promise that within a month you and I, Oceaxe, will be plucking and enjoying fruit from this new and remarkable tree."  "I love these natural experiments," he concluded, putting out his hand for another plum.  "They thrill me."  "This must be a joke," said Maskull, taking a step forward.  The youth looked at him serenely.  He made no reply, but Maskull felt as if he were being thrust backward by an iron hand on his throat.  "The morning's work is now concluded, Sature.  Come here again after Blodsombre.  After tonight you will remain here permanently, I expect, so you had better set to work to clear a patch of ground for your roots.  Never forget--however fresh and charming these plants appear to you now, in the future they will be your deadliest rivals and enemies.  Now you may go."  The man limped painfully away, across the isthmus, out of sight. Oceaxe yawned.  Maskull pushed his way forward, as if against a wall.  "Are you joking, or are you a devil?"  "I am Crimtyphon.  I never joke.  For that epithet of yours, I will devise a new punishment for you."  The duel of wills commenced without ceremony.  Oceaxe got up, stretched her beautiful limbs, smiled, and prepared herself to witness the struggle between her old lover and her new.  Crimtyphon smiled too; he reached out his hand for more fruit, but did not eat it.  Maskull's self-control broke down and he dashed at the boy, choking with red fury--his beard wagged and his face was crimson. When he realised with whom he had to deal, Crimtyphon left off smiling, slipped off the couch, and threw a terrible and malignant glare into his sorb.  Maskull staggered.  He gathered together all the brute force of his will, and by sheer weight continued his advance. The boy shrieked and ran behind the couch, trying to get away.... His opposition suddenly collapsed.  Maskull stumbled forward, recovered himself, and then vaulted clear over the high pile of mosses, to get at his antagonist.  He fell on top of him with all his bulk. Grasping his throat, he pulled his little head completely around, so that the neck was broken.  Crimtyphon immediately died.  The corpse lay underneath the tree with its face upturned.  Maskull viewed it attentively, and as he did so an expression of awe and wonder came into his own countenance.  In the moment of death Crimtyphon's face had undergone a startling and even shocking alteration.  Its personal character had wholly vanished, giving place to a vulgar, grinning mask which expressed nothing.  He did not have to search his mind long, to remember where he had seen the brother of that expression.  It was identical with that on the face of the apparition at the seance, after Krag had dealt with it.    Chapter 10  TYDOMIN  Oceaxe sat down carelessly on the couch of mosses, and began eating the plums.  "You see, you had to kill him, Maskull," she said, in a rather quizzical voice.  He came away from the corpse and regarded her--still red, and still breathing hard.  "It's no joking matter.  You especially ought to keep quiet."  "Why?"  "Because he was your husband."  "You think I ought to show grief--when I feel none?"  "Don't pretend, woman!"  Oceaxe smiled.  "From your manner one would think you were accusing me of some crime."  Maskull literally snorted at her words.  "What, you live with filth-- you live in the arms of a morbid monstrosity and then--"  "Oh, now I grasp it," she said, in a tone of perfect detachment.  "I'm glad."  "Well, Maskull," she proceeded, after a pause, "and who gave you the right to rule my conduct?  Am I not mistress of my own person?"  He looked at her with disgust, but said nothing.  There was another long interval of silence.  "I never loved him," said Oceaxe at last, looking at the ground.  "That makes it all the worse."  "What does all this mean--what do you want?"  "Nothing from you--absolutely nothing--thank heaven!"  She gave a hard laugh.  "You come here with your foreign preconceptions and expect us all to bow down to them."  "What preconceptions?"  "Just because Crimtyphon's sports are strange to you, you murder him--and you would like to murder me."  "Sports!  That diabolical cruelty."  "Oh, you're sentimental!" said Oceaxe contemptuously.  "Why do you need to make such a fuss over that man?  Life is life, all the world over, and one form is as good as another.  He was only to be made a tree, like a million other trees.  If they can endure the life, why can't he?"  "And this is Ifdawn morality!"  Oceaxe began to grow angry.  "It's you who have peculiar ideas.  You rave about the beauty of flowers and trees--you think them divine. But when it's a question of taking on this divine, fresh, pure, enchanting loveliness yourself, in your own person, it immediately becomes a cruel and wicked degradation.  Here we have a strange riddle, in my opinion."  "Oceaxe, you're a beautiful, heartless wild beast--nothing more.  If you weren't a woman--"  "Well"--curling her lip--"let us hear what would happen if I weren't a woman?"  Maskull bit his nails.  "It doesn't matter.  I can't touch you--though there's certainly not the difference of a hair between you and your boy-husband.  For this you may thank my 'foreign preconceptions.'...  Farewell!"  He turned to go.  Oceaxe's eyes slanted at him through their long lashes.  "Where are you off to, Maskull?"  "That's a matter of no importance, for wherever I go it must be a change for the better.  You walking whirlpools of crime!"  "Wait a minute.  I only want to say this.  Blodsombre is just starting, and you had better stay here till the afternoon.  We can quickly put that body out of sight, and, as you seem to detest me so much, the place is big enough--we needn't talk, or even see each other."  "I don't wish to breathe the same air."  "Singular man!"  She was sitting erect and motionless, like a beautiful statue.  "And what of your wonderful interview with Surtur, and all the undone things which you set out to do?"  "You aren't the one I shall speak to about that.  But"--he eyed her meditatively--"while I'm still here you can tell me this.  What's the meaning of the expression on that corpse's face?"  "Is that another crime, Maskull?  All dead people look like that. Ought they not to?"  "I once heard it called 'Crystalman's face.'"  "Why not?  We are all daughters and sons of Crystalman.  It is doubtless the family resemblance."  "It has also been told me that Surtur and Crystalman are one and the same."  "You have wise and truthful acquaintances."  "Then how could it have been Surtur whom I saw?" said Maskull, more to himself than to her.  "That apparition was something quite different."  She dropped her mocking manner and, sliding imperceptibly toward him, gently pulled his arm.  "You see--we have to talk.  Sit down beside me, and ask me your questions.  I'm not excessively smart, but I'll try to be of assistance."  Maskull permitted himself to be dragged down with soft violence.  She bent toward him, as if confidentially, and contrived that her sweet, cool, feminine breath should fan his cheek.  "Aren't you here to alter the evil to the good, Maskull?  Then what does it matter who sent you?"  "What can you possibly know of good and evil?"  "Are you only instructing the initiated?"  "Who am I, to instruct anybody?  However, you're quite right.  I wish to do what I can--not because I am qualified, but because I am here."  Oceaxe's voice dropped to a whisper.  "You're a giant, both in body and soul.  What you want to do, you can do."  "Is that your honest opinion, or are you flattering me for your own ends?"  She sighed.  "Don't you see how difficult you are making the conversation?  Let's talk about your work, not about ourselves."  Maskull suddenly noticed a strange blue light glowing in the northern sky.  It was from Alppain, but Alppain itself was behind the hills. While he was observing it, a peculiar wave of self-denial, of a disquieting nature, passed through him.  He looked at Oceaxe, and it struck him for the first time that he was being unnecessarily brutal to her.  He had forgotten that she was a woman, and defenceless.  "Won't you stay?" she asked all of a sudden, quite openly and frankly.  "Yes, I think I'll stay," he replied slowly.  "And another thing, Oceaxe--if I've misjudged your character, pray forgive me.  I'm a hasty, passionate man."  "There are enough easygoing men.  Hard knocks are a good medicine for vicious hearts.  And you didn't misjudge my character, as far as you went--only, every woman has more than one character.  Don't you know that?"  During the pause that followed, a snapping of twigs was heard, and both looked around, startled.  They saw a woman stepping slowly across the neck that separated them from the mainland.  "Tydomin," muttered Oceaxe, in a vexed, frightened voice.  She immediately moved away from Maskull and stood up.  The newcomer was of middle height, very slight and graceful.  She was no longer quite young.  Her face wore the composure of a woman who knows her way about the world.  It was intensely pale, and under its quiescence there just was a glimpse of something strange and dangerous.  It was curiously alluring, though not exactly beautiful. Her hair was clustering and boyish, reaching only to the neck.  It was of a strange indigo colour.  She was quaintly attired in a tunic and breeches, pieced together from the square, blue-green plates of some reptile.  Her small, ivory-white breasts were exposed.  Her sorb was black and sad--rather contemplative.  Without once glancing up at Oceaxe and Maskull, she quietly glided straight toward Crimtyphon's corpse.  When she arrived within a few feet of it, she stopped and looked down, with arms folded.  Oceaxe drew Maskull a little away, and whispered, "It's Crimtyphon's other wife, who lives under Disscourn.  She's a most dangerous woman. Be careful what you say.  If she asks you to do anything, refuse it outright."  "The poor soul looks harmless enough."  "Yes, she does--but the poor soul is quite capable of swallowing up Krag himself....  Now, play the man."  The murmur of their voices seemed to attract Tydomin's notice, for she now slowly turned her eyes toward them.  "Who killed him?" she demanded.  Her voice was so soft, low, and refined, that Maskull hardly was able to catch the words.  The sounds, however, lingered in his ears, and curiously enough seemed to grow stronger, instead of fainter.  Oceaxe whispered, "Don't say a word, leave it all to me."  Then she swung her body around to face Tydomin squarely, and said aloud, "I killed him."  Tydomin's words by this time were ringing in Maskull's head like an actual physical sound.  There was no question of being able to ignore them; he had to make an open confession of his act, whatever the consequences might be.  Quietly taking Oceaxe by the shoulder and putting her behind him, he said in a low, but perfectly distinct voice, "It was I that killed Crimtyphon."  Oceaxe looked both haughty and frightened.  "Maskull says that so as to shield me, as he thinks.  I require no shield, Maskull.  I killed him, Tydomin."  "I believe you, Oceaxe.  You did murder him.  Not with your own strength, for you brought this man along for the purpose."  Maskull took a couple of steps toward Tydomin.  "It's of little consequence who killed him, for he's better dead than alive, in my opinion.  Still, I did it.  Oceaxe had no hand in the affair."  Tydomin appeared not to hear him--she looked beyond him at Oceaxe musingly.  "When you murdered him, didn't it occur to you that I would come here, to find out?"  "I never once thought of you," replied Oceaxe, with an angry laugh. "Do you really imagine that I carry your image with me wherever I go?"  "If someone were to murder your lover here, what would you do?"  "Lying hypocrite!" Oceaxe spat out.  "You never were in love with Crimtyphon.  You always hated me, and now you think it an excellent opportunity to make it good... now that Crimtyphon's gone....  For we both know he would have made a footstool of you, if I had asked him.  He worshiped me, but he laughed at you.  He thought you ugly."  Tydomin flashed a quick, gentle smile at Maskull.  "Is it necessary for you to listen to all this?"  Without question, and feeling it the right thing to do, he walked away out of earshot.  Tydomin approached Oceaxe.  "Perhaps because my beauty fades and I'm no longer young, I needed him all the more."  Oceaxe gave a kind of snarl.  "Well, he's dead, and that's the end of it.  What are you going to do now, Tydomin?"  The other woman smiled faintly and rather pathetically.  "There's nothing left to do, except mourn the dead.  You won't grudge me that last office?"  "Do you want to stay here?" demanded Oceaxe suspiciously.  "Yes, Oceaxe dear, I wish to be alone."  "Then what is to become of us?"  "I thought that you and your lover--what is his name?"  "Maskull."  "I thought that perhaps you two would go to Disscourn, and spend Blodsombre at my home."  Oceaxe called out aloud to Maskull, "Will you come with me now to Disscourn?"  "If you wish," returned Maskull.  "Go first, Oceaxe.  I must question your friend about Crimtyphon's death.  I won't keep him."  "Why don't you question me, rather?" demanded Oceaxe, looking up sharply.  Tydomin gave the shadow of a smile.  "We know each other too well."  "Play no tricks!" said Oceaxe, and she turned to go.  "Surely you must be dreaming," said Tydomin.  "That's the way-- unless you want to walk over the cliffside."  The path Oceaxe had chosen led across the isthmus.  The direction which Tydomin proposed for her was over the edge of the precipice, into empty space.  "Shaping!  I must be mad," cried Oceaxe, with a laugh.  And she obediently followed the other's finger.  She walked straight on toward the edge of the abyss, twenty paces away.  Maskull pulled his beard around, and wondered what she was doing.  Tydomin remained standing with outstretched finger, watching her.  Without hesitation, without slackening her step once, Oceaxe strolled on--and when she had reached the extreme end of the land she still took one more step.  Maskull saw her limbs wrench as she stumbled over the edge.  Her body disappeared, and as it did so an awful shriek sounded.  Disillusionment had come to her an instant too late.  He tore himself out of his stupor, rushed to the edge of the cliff, threw himself on the ground recklessly, and looked over....  Oceaxe had vanished.  He continued staring wildly down for several minutes, and then began to sob.  Tydomin came up to him, and he got to his feet.  The blood kept rushing to his face and leaving it again.  It was some time before he could speak at all.  Then he brought out the words with difficulty.  "You shall pay for this, Tydomin.  But first I want to hear why you did it."  "Hadn't I cause?" she asked, standing with downcast eyes.  "Was it pure fiendishness?"  "It was for Crimtyphon's sake."  "She had nothing to do with that death.  I told you so."  "You are loyal to her, and I'm loyal to him."  "Loyal?  You've made a terrible blunder.  She wasn't my mistress.  I killed Crimtyphon for quite another reason.  She had absolutely no part in it."  "Wasn't she your lover?" asked Tydomin slowly.  "You've made a terrible mistake," repeated Maskull.  "I killed him because he was a wild beast.  She was as innocent of his death as you are."  Tydomin's face took on a hard look.  "So you are guilty of two deaths."  There was a dreadful silence.  "Why couldn't you believe me?" asked Maskull, who was pale and sweating painfully.  "Who gave you the right to kill him?" demanded Tydomin sternly.  He said nothing, and perhaps did not hear her question.  She sighed two or three times and began to stir restlessly.  "Since you murdered him, you must help me bury him."  "What's to be done?  This is a most fearful crime."  "You art a most fearful man.  Why did you come here, to do all this? What are we to you?"  "Unfortunately you are right."  Another pause ensued.  "It's no use standing here," said Tydomin.  "Nothing can be done.  You must come with me."  "Come with you?  Where to?"  "To Disscourn.  There's a burning lake on the far side of it.  He always wished to be cast there after death.  We can do that after Blodsombre--in the meantime we must take him home."  "You're a callous, heartless woman.  Why should he be buried when that poor girl must remain unburied?"  "You know that's out of the question," replied Tydomin quietly.  Maskull's eyes roamed about agitatedly, apparently seeing nothing.  "We must do something," she continued.  "I shall go.  You can't wish to stay here alone?"  "No, I couldn't stay here--and why should I want to?  You want me to carry the corpse?"  "He can't carry himself, and you murdered him.  Perhaps it will ease your mind to carry it."  "Ease my mind?" said Maskull, rather stupidly.  "There's only one relief for remorse, and that's voluntary pain."  "And have you no remorse?" he asked, fixing her with a heavy eye.  "These crimes are yours, Maskull," she said in a low but incisive voice.  They walked over to Crimtyphon's body, and Maskull hoisted it on to his shoulders.  It weighed heavier than he had thought.  Tydomin did not offer to assist him to adjust the ghastly burden.  She crossed the isthmus, followed by Maskull.  Their path lay through sunshine and shadow.  Branchspell was blazing in a cloudless sky, the heat was insufferable--streams of sweat coursed down his face, and the corpse seemed to grow heavier and heavier.  Tydomin always walked in front of him.  His eyes were fastened in an unseeing stare on her white, womanish calves; he looked neither to right nor left.  His features grew sullen.  At the end of ten minutes he suddenly allowed his burden to slip off his shoulders on to the ground, where it lay sprawled every which way.  He called out to Tydomin.  She quickly looked around.  "Come here.  It has just occurred to me"--he laughed--"why should I be carrying this corpse--and why should I be following you at all? What surprises me is, why this has never struck me before."  She at once came back to him.  "I suppose you're tired, Maskull.  Let us sit down.  Perhaps you have come a long way this morning?"  "Oh, it's not tiredness, but a sudden gleam of sense.  Do you know of any reason why I should be acting as your porter?"  He laughed again, but nevertheless sat down on the ground beside her.  Tydomin neither looked at him nor answered.  Her head was half bent, so as to face the northern sky, where the Alppain light was still glowing.  Maskull followed her gaze, and also watched the glow for a moment or two in silence.  "Why don't you speak?" he asked at last.  "What does that light suggest to you, Maskull?"  "I'm not speaking of that light."  "Doesn't it suggest anything at all?"  "Perhaps it doesn't.  What does it matter?"  "Not sacrifice?"  Maskull grew sullen again.  "Sacrifice of what?  What do you mean?"  "Hasn't it entered your head yet," said Tydomin, looking straight in front of her, and speaking in her delicate, hard manner, "that this adventure of yours will scarcely come to an end until you have made some sort of sacrifice?"  He returned no answer, and she said nothing more.  In a few minutes' time Maskull got up of his own accord, and irreverently, and almost angrily, threw Crimtyphon's corpse over his shoulder again.  "How far do we have to go?" he asked in a surly tone.  "An hour's walk."  "Lead on."  "Still, this isn't the sacrifice I mean," said Tydomin quietly, as she went on in front.  Almost immediately they reached more difficult ground.  They had to pass from peak to peak, as from island to island.  In some cases they were able to stride or jump across, but in others they had to make use of rude bridges of fallen timber.  It appeared to be a frequented path.  Underneath were the black, impenetrable abysses--on the surface were the glaring sunshine, the gay, painted rocks, the chaotic tangle of strange plants.  There were countless reptiles and insects.  The latter were thicker built than those of Earth-- consequently still more disgusting, and some of them were of enormous size.  One monstrous insect, as large as a horse, stood right in the centre of their path without budging.  It was armour-plated, had jaws like scimitars, and underneath its body was a forest of legs. Tydomin gave one malignant look at it, and sent it crashing into the gulf.  "What have I to offer, except my life?" Maskull suddenly broke out. "And what good is that?  It won't bring that poor girl back into the world."  "Sacrifice is not for utility.  It's a penalty which we pay."  "I know that."  "The point is whether you can go on enjoying life, after what has happened."  She waited for Maskull to come even with her.  "Perhaps you imagine I'm not man enough--you imagine that because I allowed poor Oceaxe to die for me--"  "She did die for you," said Tydomin, in a quiet, emphatic voice.  "That would be a second blunder of yours," returned Maskull, just as firmly.  "I was not in love with Oceaxe, and I'm not in love with life."  "Your life is not required."  "Then I don't understand what you want, or what you are speaking about."  "It's not for me to ask a sacrifice from you, Maskull.  That would be compliance on your part, but not sacrifice.  You must wait until you feel there's nothing else for you to do."  "It's all very mysterious."  The conversation was abruptly cut short by a prolonged and frightful crashing, roaring sound, coming from a short distance ahead.  It was accompanied by a violent oscillation of the ground on which they stood.  They looked up, startled, just in time to witness the final disappearance of a huge mass of forest land, not two hundred yards in front of them.  Several acres of trees, plants, rocks, and soil, with all its teeming animal life, vanished before their eyes, like a magic story.  The new chasm was cut, as if by a knife.  Beyond its farther edge the Alppain glow burned blue just over the horizon.  "Now we shall have to make a detour," said Tydomin, halting.  Maskull caught hold of her with his third hand.  "Listen to me, while I try to describe what I'm feeling.  When I saw that landslip, everything I have heard about the last destruction of the world came into my mind.  It seemed to me as if I were actually witnessing it, and that the world were really falling to pieces.  Then, where the land was, we now have this empty, awful gulf--that's to say, nothing--and it seems to me as if our life will come to the same condition, where there was something there will be nothing.  But that terrible blue glare on the opposite side is exactly like the eye of fate.  It accuses us, and demands what we have made of our life, which is no more.  At the same time, it is grand and joyful.  The joy consists in this--that it is in our power to give freely what will later on be taken from us by force."  Tydomin watched him attentively.  "Then your feeling is that your life is worthless, and you make a present of it to the first one who asks?"  "No, it goes beyond that.  I feel that the only thing worth living for is to be so magnanimous that fate itself will be astonished at us. Understand me.  It isn't cynicism, or bitterness, or despair, but heroism....  It's hard to explain."  "Now you shall hear what sacrifice I offer you, Maskull.  It's a heavy one, but that's what you seem to wish."  "That is so.  In my present mood it can't be too heavy."  "Then, if you are in earnest, resign your body to me.  Now that Crimtyphon's dead, I'm tired of being a woman."  "I fail to comprehend."  "Listen, then.  I wish to start a new existence in your body.  I wish to be a male.  I see it isn't worth while being a woman.  I mean to dedicate my own body to Crimtyphon.  I shall tie his body and mine together, and give them a common funeral in the burning lake.  That's the sacrifice I offer you.  As I said, it's a hard one."  "So you do ask me to die.  Though how you can make use of my body is difficult to understand."  "No, I don't ask you to die.  You will go on living."  "How is it possible without a body?"  Tydomin gazed at him earnestly.  "There are many such beings, even in your world.  There you call them spirits, apparitions, phantoms. They are in reality living wills, deprived of material bodies, always longing to act and enjoy, but quite unable to do so.  Are you noble- minded enough to accept such a state, do you think?"  "If it's possible, I accept it," replied  Maskull quietly.  "Not in spite of its heaviness, but because of it.  But how is it possible?"  "Undoubtedly there are very many things possible in our world of which you have no conception.  Now let us wait till we get home.  I don't hold you to your word, for unless it's a free sacrifice I will have nothing to do with it."  "I am not a man who speaks lightly.  If you can perform this miracle, you have my consent, once for all."  "Then we'll leave it like that for the present," said Tydomin sadly.  They proceeded on their way.  Owing to the subsidence, Tydomin seemed rather doubtful at first as to the right road, but by making a long divergence they eventually got around to the other side of the newly formed chasm.  A little later on, in a narrow copse crowning a miniature, insulated peak, they fell in with a man.  He was resting himself against a tree, and looked tired, overheated, and despondent. He was young.  His beardless expression bore an expression of unusual sincerity, and in other respects he seemed a hardy, hardworking youth, of an intellectual type.  His hair was thick, short, and flaxen.  He possessed neither a sorb nor a third arm--so presumably he was not a native of Ifdawn.  His forehead, however, was disfigured by what looked like a haphazard assortment of eyes, eight in number, of different sizes and shapes.  They went in pairs, and whenever two were in use, it was indicated by a peculiar shining--the rest remained dull, until their turn came.  In addition to the upper eyes he had the two lower ones, but they were vacant and lifeless.  This extraordinary battery of eyes, alternatively alive and dead, gave the young man an appearance of almost alarming mental activity.  He was wearing nothing but a sort of skin kilt.  Maskull seemed somehow to recognise the face, though he had certainly never set eyes on it before.  Tydomin suggested to him to set down the corpse, and both sat down to rest in the shade.  "Question him, Maskull," she said, rather carelessly, jerking her head toward the stranger.  Maskull sighed and asked aloud, from his seat on the ground, "What's your name, and where do you come from?"  The man studied him for a few moments, first with one pair of eyes, then with another, then with a third.  He next turned his attention to Tydomin, who occupied him a still longer time.  He replied at last, in a dry, manly, nervous voice.  "I am Digrung.  I have arrived here from Matterplay."  His colour kept changing, and Maskull suddenly realised of whom he reminded him.  It was of Joiwind.  "Perhaps you're going to Poolingdred, Digrung?" he inquired, interested.  "As a matter of fact I am--if I can find my way out of this accursed country."  "Possibly you are acquainted with Joiwind there?"  "She's my sister.  I'm on my way to see her now.  Why, do you know her?"  "I met her yesterday."  "What is your name, then?"  "Maskull."  "I shall tell her I met you.  This will be our first meeting for four years.  Is she well, and happy?"  "Both, as far as I could judge.  You know Panawe?"  "Her husband--yes.  But where do you come from?  I've seen nothing like you before."  "From another world.  Where is Matterplay?"  "It's the first country one comes to beyond the Sinking Sea."  "What is it like there--how do you amuse yourselves?  The same old murders and sudden deaths?"  "Are you ill?" asked Digrung.  "Who is this woman, why are you following at her heels like a slave?  She looks insane to me.  What's that corpse--why are you dragging it around the country with you?"  Tydomin smiled.  "I've already heard it said about Matterplay, that if one sows an answer there, a rich crop of questions immediately springs up.  But why do you make this unprovoked attack on me, Digrung?"  "I don't attack you, woman, but I know you.  I see into you, and I see insanity.  That wouldn't matter, but I don't like to see a man of intelligence like Maskull caught in your filthy meshes."  "I suppose even you clever Matterplay people sometimes misjudge character.  However, I don't mind.  Your opinion's nothing to me, Digrung.  You'd better answer his questions, Maskull.  Not for his own sake--but your feminine friend is sure to be curious about your having been seen carrying a dead man."  Maskull's underlip shot out.  "Tell your sister nothing, Digrung. Don't mention my name at all.  I don't want her to know about this meeting of ours."  "Why not?"  "I don't wish it--isn't that enough?"  Digrung looked impassive.  "Thoughts and words," he said, "which don't correspond with the real events of the world are considered most shameful in Matterplay."  "I'm not asking you to lie, only to keep silent."  "To hide the truth is a special branch of lying.  I can't accede to your wish.  I must tell Joiwind everything, as far as I know it."  Maskull got up, and Tydomin followed his example.  She touched Digrung on the arm and gave him a strange look.  "The dead man is my husband, and Maskull murdered him.  Now you'll understand why he wishes you to hold your tongue."  "I guessed there was some foul play," said Digrung.  "It doesn't matter--I can't falsify facts.  Joiwind must know."  "You refuse to consider her feelings?" said Maskull, turning pale.  "Feelings which flourish on illusions, and sicken and die on realities, aren't worth considering.  But Joiwind's are not of that kind."  "If you decline to do what I ask, at least return home without seeing her; your sister will get very little pleasure out of the meeting when she hears your news."  "What are these strange relations between you?" demanded Digrung, eying him with suddenly aroused suspicion.  Maskull stared back in a sort of bewilderment.  "Good God!  You don't doubt your own sister.  That pure angel!"  Tydomin caught hold of him delicately.  "I don't know Joiwind, but, whoever she is and whatever she's like, I know this--she's more fortunate in her friend than in her brother.  Now, if you really value her happiness, Maskull, you will have to take some firm step or other."  "I mean to.  Digrung, I shall stop your journey."  "If you intend a second murder, no doubt you are big enough."  Maskull turned around to Tydomin and laughed.  "I seem to be leaving a wake of corpses behind me on this journey."  "Why a corpse?  There's no need to kill him."  "Thanks for that!" said Digrung dryly.  "All the same, some crime is about to burst.  I feel it."  "What must I do, then?" asked Maskull.  "It is not my business, and to tell the truth I am not very interested....  If I were in your place, Maskull, I would not hesitate long.  Don't you understand how to absorb these creatures, who set their feeble, obstinate wills against yours?"  "That is a worse crime," said Maskull.  "Who knows?  He will live, but he will tell no tales."  Digrung laughed, but changed colour.  "I was right then.  The monster has sprung into the light of day."  Maskull laid a hand on his shoulder.  "You have the choice, and we are not joking.  Do as I ask."  "You have fallen low, Maskull.  But you are walking in a dream, and I can't talk to you.  As for you, woman--sin must be like a pleasant bath to you...."  "There are strange ties between Maskull and myself; but you are a passer-by, a foreigner.  I care nothing for you."  "Nevertheless, I shall not be frightened out of my plans, which are legitimate and right."  "Do as you please," said Tydomin.  "If you come to grief, your thoughts will hardly have corresponded with the real events of the world, which is what you boast about.  It is no affair of mine."  "I shall go on, and not back!" exclaimed Digrung, with angry emphasis.  Tydomin threw a swift, evil smile at Maskull.  "Bear witness that I have tried to persuade this young man.  Now you must come to a quick decision in your own mind as to which is of the greatest importance, Digrung's happiness or Joiwind's.  Digrung won't allow you to preserve them both."  "It won't take me long to decide.  Digrung, I gave you a last chance to change your mind."  "As long as it's in my power I shall go on, and warn my sister against her criminal friends."  Maskull again clutched at him, but this time with violence. Instructed in his actions by some new and horrible instinct, he pressed the young man tightly to his body with all three arms.  A feeling of wild, sweet delight immediately passed through him.  Then for the first time he comprehended the triumphant joys of "absorbing."  It satisfied the hunger of the will, exactly as food satisfies the hunger of the body.  Digrung proved feeble--he made little opposition.  His personality passed slowly and evenly into Maskull's.  The latter became strong and gorged.  The victim gradually became paler and limper, until Maskull held a corpse in his arms.  He dropped the body, and stood trembling.  He had committed his second crime.  He felt no immediate difference in his soul, but...  Tydomin shed a sad smile on him, like winter sunshine.  He half expected her to speak, but she said nothing.  Instead, she made a sign to him to pick up Crimtyphon's corpse.  As he obeyed, he wondered why Digrung's dead face did not wear the frightful Crystalman mask.  "Why hasn't he altered?" he muttered to himself.  Tydomin heard him.  She kicked Digrung lightly with her little foot. "He isn't dead--that's why.  The expression you mean is waiting for your death."  "Then is that my real character?"  She laughed softly.  "You came here to carve a strange world, and now it appears you are carved yourself.  Oh, there's no doubt about it, Maskull.  You needn't stand there gaping.  You belong to Shaping, like the rest of us.  You are not a king, or a god."  "Since when have I belonged to him?"  "What does that matter?  Perhaps since you first breathed the air of Tormance, or perhaps since five minutes ago."  Without waiting for his response, she set off through the copse, and strode on to the next island.  Maskull followed, physically distressed and looking very grave.  The journey continued for half an hour longer, without incident.  The character of the scenery slowly changed.  The mountaintops became loftier and more widely separated from one another.  The gaps were filled with rolling, white clouds, which bathed the shores of the peaks like a mysterious sea.  To pass from island to island was hard work, the intervening spaces were so wide--Tydomin, however, knew the way.  The intense light, the violet-blue sky, the patches of vivid landscape, emerging from the white vapour-ocean, made a profound impression on Maskull's mind.  The glow of Alppain was hidden by the huge mass of Disscourn, which loomed up straight in front of them.  The green snow on the top of the gigantic pyramid had by now completely melted away.  The black, gold, and crimson of its mighty cliffs stood out with terrific brilliance.  They were directly beneath the bulk of the mountain, which was not a mile away.  It did not appear dangerous to climb, but he was unaware on which side of it their destination lay.  It was split from top to bottom by numerous straight fissures.  A few pale-green waterfalls descended here and there, like narrow, motionless threads.  The face of the mountain was rugged and bare. It was strewn with detached boulders, and great, jagged rocks projected everywhere like iron teeth.  Tydomin pointed to a small black hole near the base, which might be a cave.  "That is where I live."  "You live here alone?"  "Yes."  "It's an odd choice for a woman--and you are not unbeautiful, either."  "A woman's life is over at twenty-five," she replied, sighing.  "And I am far older than that.  Ten years ago it would have been I who lived yonder, and not Oceaxe.  Then all this wouldn't have happened."  A quarter of an hour later they stood within the mouth of the cave. It was ten feet high, and its interior was impenetrably black.  "Put down the body in the entrance, out of the sun," directed Tydomin.  He did so.  She cast a keenly scrutinising glance at him.  "Does your resolution still hold, Maskull?"  "Why shouldn't it hold?  My brains are not feathers."  "Follow me, then."  They both stepped into the cave.  At that very moment a sickening crash, like heavy thunder just over their heads, set Maskull's weakened heart thumping violently.  An avalanche of boulders, stones, and dust, swept past the cave entrance from above.  If their going in had been delayed by a single minute, they would have been killed.  Tydomin did not even look up.  She took his hand in hers, and started walking with him into the darkness.  The temperature became as cold as ice.  At the first bend the light from the outer world disappeared, leaving them in absolute blackness.  Maskull kept stumbling over the uneven ground, but she kept tight hold of him, and hurried him along.  The tunnel seemed of interminable length.  Presently, however, the atmosphere changed--or such was his impression.  He was somehow led to imagine that they had come to a larger chamber.  Here Tydomin stopped, and then forced him down with quiet pressure.  His groping hand encountered stone and, by feeling it all over, he discovered that it was a sort of stone slab, or couch, raised a foot or eighteen inches from the ground.  She told him to lie down.  "Has the time come?" asked Maskull.  "Yes."  He lay there waiting in the darkness, ignorant of what was going to happen.  He felt her hand clasping his.  Without perceiving any gradation, he lost all consciousness of his body; he was no longer able to feel his limbs or internal organs.  His mind remained active and alert.  Nothing particular appeared to be taking place.  Then the chamber began to grow light, like very early morning.  He could see nothing, but the retina of his eyes was affected.  He fancied that he heard music, but while he was listening for it, it stopped.  The light grew stronger, the air grew warmer; he heard the confused sound of distant voices.  Suddenly Tydomin gave his hand a powerful squeeze.  He heard someone scream faintly, and then the light leaped up, and he saw everything clearly.  He was lying on a wooden couch, in a strangely decorated room, lighted by electricity.  His hand was being squeezed, not by Tydomin, but by a man dressed in the garments of civilisation, with whose face he was certainly familiar, but under what circumstances he could not recall.  Other people stood in the background--they too were vaguely known to him.  He sat up and began to smile, without any especial reason; and then stood upright.  Everybody seemed to be watching him with anxiety and emotion--he wondered why.  Yet he felt that they were all acquaintances.  Two in particular he knew--the man at the farther end of the room, who paced restlessly backward  and forward, his face transfigured by stern, holy grandeur; and that other big, bearded man--who was himself.  Yes--he was looking at his own double.  But it was just as if a crime-riddled man of middle age were suddenly confronted with his own photograph as an earnest, idealistic youth.  His other self spoke to him.  He heard the sounds, but did not comprehend the sense.  Then the door was abruptly flung open, and a short, brutish-looking individual leaped in.  He began to behave in an extraordinary manner to everyone around him; and after that came straight up to him--Maskull.  He spoke some words, but they were incomprehensible.  A terrible expression came over the newcomer's face, and he grasped his neck with a pair of hairy hands.  Maskull felt his bones bending and breaking, excruciating pains passed through all the nerves of his body, and he experienced a sense of impending death.  He cried out, and sank helplessly on the floor, in a heap.  The chamber and the company vanished--the light went out.  Once more he found himself in the blackness of the cave.  He was this time lying on the ground, but Tydomin was still with him, holding his hand.  He was in horrible bodily agony, but this was only a setting for the despairing anguish that filled his mind.  Tydomin addressed him in tones of gentle reproach.  "Why are you back so soon?  I've not had time yet.  You must return."  He caught hold of her, and pulled himself up to his feet.  She gave a low scream, as though in pain.  "What does this mean--what are you doing, Maskull?"  "Krag--" began Maskull, but the effort to produce his words choked him, so that he was obliged to stop.  "Krag--what of Krag?  Tell me quickly what has happened.  Free my arm."  He gripped her arm tighter.  "Yes, I've seen Krag.  I'm awake."  "Oh!  You are awake, awake."  "And you must die," said Maskull, in an awful voice.  "But why?  What has happened?..."  "You must die, and I must kill you.  Because I am awake, and for no other reason.  You blood-stained dancing mistress!"  Tydomin breathed hard for a little time.  Then she seemed suddenly to regain her self-possession.  "You won't offer me violence, surely, in this black cave?"  "No, the sun shall look on, for it is not a murder.  But rest assured that you must die--you must expiate your fearful crimes."  "You have already said so, and I see you have the power.  You have escaped me.  It is very curious.  Well, then, Maskull, let us come outside.  I am not afraid.  But kill me courteously, for I have also been courteous to you.  I make no other supplication."    Chapter 11  ON DISSCOURN  BY THE TIME that they regained the mouth of the cavern, Blodsombre was at its height.  In front of them the scenery sloped downward--a long succession of mountain islands in a sea of clouds.  Behind them the bright, stupendous crags of Disscourn loomed up for a thousand feet or more.  Maskull's eyes were red, and his face looked stupid; he was still holding the woman by the arm.  She made no attempt to speak, or to get away.  She seemed perfectly gentle and composed.  After gazing at the country for along time in silence, he turned toward her.  "Whereabouts is the fiery lake you spoke of?"  "It lies on the other side of the mountain.  But why do you ask?"  "It is just as well if we have some way to walk.  I shall grow calmer, and that's what I want.  I wish you to understand that what is going to happen is not a murder, but an execution."  "It will taste the same," said Tydomin.  "When I have gone out of this country, I don't wish to feel that I have left a demon behind me, wandering at large.  That would not be fair to others.  So we will go to the lake, which promises an easy death for you."  She shrugged her shoulders.  "We must wait till Blodsombre is over."  "Is this a time for luxurious feelings?  However hot it is now, we will both be cool by evening.  We must start at once."  "Without doubt, you are the master, Maskull....  May I not carry Crimtyphon?"  Maskull looked at her strangely.  "I grudge no man his funeral."  She painfully hoisted the body on her narrow shoulders, and they stepped out into the sunlight.  The heat struck them like a blow on the head.  Maskull moved aside, to allow her to precede him, but no compassion entered his heart.  He brooded over the wrongs the woman had done him.  The way went along the south side of the great pyramid, near its base.  It was a rough road, clogged with boulders and crossed by cracks and water gullies; they could see the water, but could not get at it.  There was no shade.  Blisters formed on their skin, while all the water in their blood seemed to dry up.  Maskull forgot his own tortures in his devil's delight at Tydomin's. "Sing me a song!" he called out presently.  "A characteristic one."  She turned her head and gave him a long, peculiar look; then, without any sort of expostulation, started singing.  Her voice was low and weird.  The song was so extraordinary that he had to rub his eyes to ascertain whether he was awake or dreaming.  The slow surprises of the grotesque melody began to agitate him in a horrible fashion; the words were pure nonsense--or else their significance was too deep for him.  "Where, in the name of all unholy things, did you acquire that stuff, woman?"  Tydomin shed a sickly smile, while the corpse swayed about with ghastly jerks over her left shoulder.  She held it in position with her two left arms.  "It's a pity we could not have met as friends, Maskull.  I could have shown you a side of Tormance which now perhaps you will never see.  The wild, mad, side.  But now it's too late, and it doesn't matter."  They turned the angle of the mountain, and started to traverse the western base.  "Which is the quickest way out of this miserable land?" asked Maskull.  "It is easiest to go to Sant."  "Will we see it from anywhere?"  "Yes, though it is a long way off."  "Have you been there?"  "I am a woman, and interdicted."  "True.  I have heard something of the sort."  "But don't ask me any more questions," said Tydomin, who was becoming faint.  Maskull stopped at a little spring.  He himself drank, and then made a cup of his hand for the woman, so that she might not have to lay down her burden.  The gnawl water acted like magic--it seemed to replenish all the cells of his body as though they had been thirsty sponge pores, sucking up liquid.  Tydomin recovered her self- possession.  About three-quarters of an hour later they worked around the second corner, and entered into full view of the north aspect of Disscourn.  A hundred yards lower down the slope on which they were walking, the mountain ended abruptly in a chasm.  The air above it was filled with a sort of green haze, which trembled violently like the atmosphere immediately over a furnace.  "The lake is underneath," said Tydomin.  Maskull looked curiously about him.  Beyond the crater the country sloped away in a continuous descent to the skyline.  Behind them, a narrow path channelled its way up through the rocks toward the towering summit of the pyramid.  Miles away, in the north-east quarter, a long, flat-topped plateau raised its head far above all the surrounding country.  It was Sant--and there and then he made up his mind that that should be his destination that day.  Tydomin meanwhile had walked straight to the gulf, and set down Crimtyphon's body on the edge.  In a minute or two, Maskull joined her; arrived at the brink, he immediately flung himself at full length on his chest, to see what could be seen of the lake of fire. A gust of hot, asphyxiating air smote his face and set him coughing, but he did not get up until he had stared his fill at the huge sea of green, molten lava, tossing and swirling at no great distance below, like a living will.  A faint sound of drumming came up.  He listened intently, and as he did so his heart quickened and the black cares rolled away from his soul.  All the world and its accidents seemed at that moment false, and without meaning....  He climbed abstractedly to his feet.  Tydomin was talking to her dead husband.  She was peering into the hideous face of ivory, and fondling his violet hair.  When she perceived Maskull, she hastily kissed the withered lips, and got up from her knees.  Lifting the corpse with all three arms, she staggered with it to the extreme edge of the gulf and, after an instant's hesitation, allowed it to drop into the lava.  It disappeared immediately without sound; a metallic splash came up.  That was Crimtyphon's funeral.  "Now I am ready, Maskull."  He did not answer, but stared past her.  Another figure was standing, erect and mournful, not far behind her.  It was Joiwind.  Her face was wan, and there was an accusing look in her eyes.  Maskull knew that it was a phantasm, and that the real Joiwind was miles away, at Poolingdred.  "Turn around, Tydomin," he said oddly, "and tell me what you see behind you."  "I don't see anything," she answered, looking around.  "But I see Joiwind."  Just as he was speaking, the apparition vanished.  "Now I present you with your life, Tydomin.  She wishes it."  The woman fingered her chin thoughtfully.  "I little expected I should ever be beholden for my life to one of my own sex--but so be it.  What really happened to you in my cavern?"  "I really saw Krag."  "Yes, some miracle must have taken place."  She suddenly shivered. "Come, let us leave this horrible spot.  I shall never come here again."  "Yes," said Maskull, "it stinks of death and dying.  But where are we to go--what are we to do?  Take me to Sant.  I must get away from this hellish land."  Tydomin remained standing, dull and hollow-eyed.  Then she gave an abrupt, bitter little laugh.  "We make our journey together in singular stages.  Rather than be alone, I'll come with you--but you know that if I set foot in Sant they will kill me."  "At least set me on the way.  I wish to get there before night.  Is it possible?"  "If you are willing to take risks with nature.  And why should you not take risks today?  Your luck holds.  But someday or other it won't hold--your luck."  "Let us start," said Maskull.  "The luck I've had so far is nothing to brag about."  Blodsombre was over when they set off; it was early afternoon, but the heat seemed more stifling than ever.  They made no more pretence at conversation; both were buried in their own painful thoughts.  The land fell away from Disscourn in all other directions, but toward Sant there was a gentle, persistent rise.  Its dark, distant plateau continued to dominate the landscape, and after walking for an hour they seemed none the nearer to it.  The air was stale and stagnant.  By and by, an upright object, apparently the work of man, attracted Maskull's notice.  It was a slender tree stem, with the bark still on, imbedded in the stony ground.  From the upper end three branches sprang out, pointing aloft at a sharp angle.  They were stripped to twigs and leaves and, getting closer, he saw that they had been artificially fastened on, at equal distances from each other.  As he stared at the object, a strange, sudden flush of confident vanity and self-sufficiency seemed to pass through him, but it was so momentary that he could be sure of nothing.  "What may that be, Tydomin?"  "It is Hator's Trifork."  "And what is its purpose?"  "It's a guide to Sant."  "But who or what is Hator?"  "Hator was the founder of Sant--many thousands of years ago.  He laid down the principles they all live by, and that trifork is his symbol.  When I was a little child my father told me the legends, but I've forgotten most of them."  Maskull regarded it attentively.  "Does it affect you in any way?"  "And why should it do that?" she said, dropping her lip scornfully. "I am only a woman, and these are masculine mysteries."  "A sort of gladness came over me," said Maskull, "but perhaps I am mistaken."  They passed on.  The scenery gradually changed in character.  The solid parts of the land grew more continuous, the fissures became narrower and more infrequent.  There were now no more subsidences or upheavals.  The peculiar nature of the Ifdawn Marest appeared to be giving place to a different order of things.  Later on, they encountered a flock of pale blue jellies floating in the air.  They were miniature animals.  Tydomin caught one in her hand and began to eat it, just as one eats a luscious pear plucked from a tree.  Maskull, who had fasted since early morning, was not slow in following her example.  A sort of electric vigour at once entered his limbs and body, his muscles regained their elasticity, his heart began to beat with hard, slow, strong throbs.  "Food and body seem to agree well in this world," he remarked smiling.  She glanced toward him.  "Perhaps the explanation is not in the food, but in your body."  "I brought my body with me."  "You brought your soul with you, but that's altering fast, too."  In a copse they came across a short, wide tree, without leaves, but possessing a multitude of thin, flexible branches, like the tentacles of a cuttlefish.  Some of these branches were moving rapidly.  A furry animal, somewhat resembling a wildcat, leaped about among them in the most extraordinary way.  But the next minute Maskull was shocked to realise that the beast was not leaping at all, but was being thrown from branch to branch by the volition of the tree, exactly as an imprisoned mouse is thrown by a cat from paw to paw.  He watched the spectacle a while with morbid interest.  "That's a gruesome reversal of roles, Tydomin."  "One can see you're disgusted," she replied, stifling a yawn.  "But that is because you are a slave to words.  If you called that plant an animal, you would find its occupation perfectly natural and pleasing.  And why should you not call it an animal?"  "I am quite aware that, as long as I remain in the Ifdawn Marest, I shall go on listening to this sort of language."  They trudged along for an hour or more without talking.  The day became overcast.  A thin mist began to shroud the landscape, and the sun changed into an immense ruddy disk which could be stared at without flinching.  A chill, damp wind blew against them.  Presently it grew still darker, the sun disappeared and, glancing first at his companion and then at himself, Maskull noticed that their skin and clothing were coated by a kind of green hoarfrost.  The land was now completely solid.  About half a mile, in front of them, against a background of dark fog, a moving forest of tall waterspouts gyrated slowly and gracefully hither and thither.  They were green and self-luminous, and looked terrifying.  Tydomin explained that they were not waterspouts at all, but mobile columns of lightning.  "Then they are dangerous?"  "So we think," she answered, watching them closely.  "Someone is wandering there who appears to have a different opinion."  Among the spouts, and entirely encompassed by them, a man was walking with a slow, calm, composed gait, his back turned toward Maskull and Tydomin.  There was something unusual in his appearance--his form looked extraordinarily distinct, solid, and real.  "If there's danger, he ought to be warned," said Maskull.  "He who is always anxious to teach will learn nothing," returned the woman coolly.  She restrained Maskull by a pressure of the arm, and continued to watch.  The base of one of the columns touched the man.  He remained unharmed, but turned sharply around, as if for the first time made aware of the proximity of these deadly waltzers.  Then he raised himself to his full height, and stretched both arms aloft above his head, like a diver.  He seemed to be addressing the columns.  While they looked on, the electric spouts discharged themselves, with a series of loud explosions.  The stranger stood alone, uninjured. He dropped his arms.  The next moment he caught sight of the two, and stood still, waiting for them to come up.  The pictorial clarity of his person grew more and more noticeable as they approached; his body seemed to be composed of some substance heavier and denser than solid matter.  Tydomin looked perplexed.  "He must be a Sant man.  I have seen no one quite like him before. This is a day of days for me."  "He must be an individual of great importance," murmured Maskull.  They now came up to him.  He was tall, strong, and bearded, and was clothed in a shirt and breeches of skin.  Since turning his back to the wind, the green deposit on his face and limbs had changed to streaming moisture, through which his natural colour was visible; it was that of pale iron.  There was no third arm.  His face was harsh and frowning, and a projecting chin pushed the beard forward.  On his forehead there were two flat membranes, like rudimentary eyes, but no sorb.  These membranes were expressionless, but in some strange way seemed to add vigour to the stem eyes underneath.  When his glance rested on Maskull, the latter felt as though his brain were being thoroughly travelled through.  The man was middle-aged.  His physical distinctness transcended nature.  By contrast with him, every object in the neighbourhood looked vague and blurred. Tydomin's person suddenly appeared faint, sketch-like, without significance, and Maskull realised that it was no better with himself.  A queer, quickening fire began running through his veins.  He turned to the woman.  "If this man is going to Sant, I shall bear him company.  We can now part.  No doubt you will think it high time."  "Let Tydomin come too."  The words were delivered in a rough, foreign tongue, but were as intelligible to Maskull as if spoken in English.  "You who know my name, also know my sex," said Tydomin quietly.  "It is death for me to enter Sant."  "That is the old law.  I am the bearer of the new law."  "Is it so--and will it be accepted?"  "The old skin is cracking, the new skin has been silently forming underneath, the moment of sloughing has arrived."  The storm gathered.  The green snow drove against them, as they stood talking, and it grew intensely cold.  None noticed it.  "What is your name?" asked Maskull, with a beating heart.  "My name, Maskull, is Spadevil.  You, a voyager across the dark ocean of space, shall be my first witness and follower.  You, Tydomin, a daughter of the despised sex, shall be my second."  "The new law?  But what is it?"  "Until eye sees, of what use it is for ear to hear? ....  Come, both of you, to me!"  Tydomin went to him unhesitatingly.  Spadevil pressed his hand on her sorb and kept it there for a few minutes, while he closed his own eyes.  When he removed it, Maskull observed that the sorb was transformed into twin membranes like Spadevil's own.  Tydomin looked dazed.  She glanced quietly about for a little while, apparently testing her new faculty.  Then the tears started to her eyes and, snatching up Spadevil's hand, she bent over and kissed it hurriedly many times.  "My past has been bad," she said.  "Numbers have received harm from me, and none good.  I have killed and worse.  But now I can throw all that away, and laugh.  Nothing can now injure me.  Oh, Maskull, you and I have been fools together!"  "Don't you repent your crimes?" asked Maskull.  "Leave the past alone," said Spadevil, "it cannot be reshaped.  The future alone is ours.  It starts fresh and clean from this very minute.  Why do you hesitate, Maskull?  Are you afraid?"  "What is the name of, those organs, and what is their function?"  "They are probes, and they are the gates opening into a new world."  Maskull lingered no longer, but permitted Spadevil to cover his sorb.  While the iron hand was still pressing his forehead, the new law quietly flowed into his consciousness, like a smooth-running stream of clean water which had hitherto been dammed by his obstructive will.  The law was duty.    Chapter 12  SPADEVIL  Maskull found that his new organs had no independent function of their own, but only intensified and altered his other senses.  When he used his eyes, ears, or nostrils, the same objects presented themselves to him, but his judgment concerning them was different. Previously all external things had existed for him; now he existed for them.  According to whether they served his purpose or were in harmony with his nature, or otherwise, they had been pleasant or painful.  Now these words "pleasure" and "pain" simply had no meaning.  The other two watched him, while he was making himself acquainted with his new mental outlook.  He smiled at them.  "You were quite right, Tydomin," he said, in a bold, cheerful voice. "We have been fools.  So near the light all the time, and we never guessed it.  Always buried in the past or future--systematically ignoring the present--and now it turns out that apart from the present we have no life at all."  "Thank Spadevil for it," she answered, more loudly than usual.  Maskull looked at the man's dark, concrete form.  "Spadevil, now I mean to follow you to the end.  I can do nothing less."  The severe face showed no sign of gratification--not a muscle relaxed.  "Watch that you don't lose your gift," he said gruffly.  Tydomin spoke.  "You promised that I should enter Sant with you."  "Attach yourself to the truth, not to me.  For I may die before you, but the truth will accompany you to your death.  However, now let us journey together, all three of us."  The words had not left his mouth before he put his face against the fine, driving snow, and pressed onward toward his destination.  He walked with a long stride; Tydomin was obliged to half run in order to keep up with him.  The three travelled abreast; Spadevil in the middle.  The fog was so dense that it was impossible to see a hundred yards ahead.  The ground was covered by the green snow.  The wind blew in gusts from the Sant highlands and was piercingly cold.  "Spadevil, are you a man, or more than a man?" asked Maskull.  "He that is not more than a man is nothing."  "Where have you now come from?"  "From brooding, Maskull.  Out of no other mother can truth be born.  I have brooded, and rejected; and I have brooded again.  Now, after many months' absence from Sant, the truth at last shines forth for me in its simple splendour, like an upturned diamond."  "I see its shining," said Maskull.  "But how much does it owe to ancient Hator?"  "Knowledge has its seasons.  The blossom was to Hator, the fruit is to me.  Hator also was a brooder--but now his followers do not brood.  In Sant all is icy selfishness, a living death.  They hate pleasure, and this hatred is the greatest pleasure to them."  "But in what way have they fallen off from Hator's doctrines?"  "For him, in his sullen purity of nature, all the world was a snare, a limed twig.  Knowing that pleasure was everywhere, a fierce, mocking enemy, crouching and waiting at every corner of the road of life, in order to kill with its sweet sting the naked grandeur of the soul, he shielded himself behind pain.  This also his followers do, but they do not do it for the sake of the soul, but for the sake of vanity and pride."  "What is the Trifork?"  "The stem, Maskull, is hatred of pleasure.  The first fork is disentanglement from the sweetness of the world.  The second fork is power over those who still writhe in the nets of illusion.  The third fork is the healthy glow of one who steps into ice-cold water."  "From what land did Hator come?"  "It is not said.  He lived in Ifdawn for a while.  There are many legends told of him while there."  "We have a long way to go," said Tydomin.  "Relate some of these legends, Spadevil."  The snow had ceased, the day brightened, Branchspell reappeared like a phantom sun, but bitter blasts of wind still swept over the plain.  "In those days," said Spadevil, "there existed in Ifdawn a mountain island separated by wide spaces from the land around it.  A handsome girl, who knew sorcery, caused a bridge to be constructed across which men and women might pass to it.  Having by a false tale drawn Hator on to this rock, she pushed at the bridge with her foot until it tumbled into the depths below.  'You and I, Hator, are now together, and there is no means of separating.  I wish to see how long the famous frost man can withstand the breath, smiles and perfume of a girl.'  Hator said no word, either then or all that day.  He stood till sunset like a tree trunk, and thought of other things.  Then the girl grew passionate, and shook her curls.  She rose from where she was sitting she looked at him, and touched his arm; but he did not see her.  She looked at him, so that all the soul was in her eyes; and then she fell down dead.  Hator awoke from his thoughts, and saw her lying, still warm, at his feet, a corpse.  He passed to the mainland; but how, it is not related."  Tydomin shuddered.  "You too have met your wicked woman, Spadevil; but your method is a nobler one."  "Don't pity other women," said Spadevil, "but love the right.  Hator also once conversed with Shaping."  "With the Maker of the World?" said Maskull thoughtfully.  "With the Maker of Pleasure.  It is told how Shaping defended his world, and tried to force Hator to acknowledge loveliness and joy. But Hator, answering all his marvellous speeches in a few concise, iron words, showed how this joy and beauty was but another name for the bestiality of souls wallowing in luxury and sloth.  Shaping smiled, and said, 'How comes it that your wisdom is greater than that of the Master of wisdom?'  Hator said, 'My wisdom does not come from you, nor from your world, but from that other world, which you, Shaping, have vainly tried to imitate.'  Shaping replied, 'What, then, do you do in my world?'  Hator said, 'I am here falsely, and therefore I am subject to your false pleasures.  But I wrap myself in pain-- not because it is good, but because I wish to keep myself as far from you as possible.  For pain is not yours, neither does it belong to the other world, but it is the shadow cast by your false pleasures.' Shaping then said, 'What is this faraway other world of which you say "This is so--this is not so?"  How happens it that you alone of all my creatures have knowledge of it?'  But Hator spat at his feet, and said, 'You lie, Shaping.  All have knowledge of it.  You, with your pretty toys, alone obscure it from our view.'  Shaping asked, 'What, then, am I?'  Hator answered, 'You are the dreamer of impossible dreams.'  And then the story goes that Shaping departed, ill pleased with what had been said."  "What other world did Hator refer to?" asked Maskull.  "One where grandeur reigns, Maskull, just as pleasure reigns here."  "Whether grandeur or pleasure, it makes no difference," said Maskull. "The individual spirit that lives and wishes to live is mean and corrupt-natured."  "Guard you your pride!" returned Spadevil.  "Do not make law for the universe and for all time, but for yourself and for this small, false life of yours."  "In what shape did death come to that hard, unconquerable man?" asked Tydomin.  "He lived to be old, but went upright and free-limbed to his last hour.  When he saw that death could not be staved off longer he determined to destroy himself.  He gathered his friends around him; not from vanity, but that they might see to what lengths the human soul can go in its perpetual warfare with the voluptuous body. Standing erect, without support, he died by withholding his breath."  A silence followed, which lasted for perhaps an hour.  Their minds refused to acknowledge the icy winds, but the current of their thoughts became frozen.  When Branchspell, however, shone out again, though with subdued power, Maskull's curiosity rose once more.  "Your fellow countrymen, then, Spadevil, are sick with self-love?"  "The men of other countries," said Spadevil, "are the slaves of pleasure and desire, knowing it.  But the men of my country are the slaves of pleasure and desire, not knowing it."  "And yet that proud pleasure, which rejoices in self-torture, has something noble in it."  "He who studies himself at all is ignoble.  Only by despising soul as well as body can a man enter into true life."  "On what grounds do they reject women?"  "Inasmuch as a woman has ideal love, and cannot live for herself. Love for another is pleasure for the loved one, and therefore injurious to him."  "A forest of false ideas is waiting for your axe," said Maskull. "But will they allow it?"  "Spadevil knows, Maskull," said Tydomin, "that be it today or be it tomorrow, love can't be kept out of a land, even by the disciples of Hator."  "Beware of love--beware of emotion!" exclaimed Spadevil.  "Love is but pleasure once removed.  Think not of pleasing others, but of serving them."  "Forgive me, Spadevil, if I am still feminine."  "Right has no sex.  So long, Tydomin, as you remember that you are a woman, so long you will not enter into divine apathy of soul."  "But where there are no women, there are no children," said Maskull. "How came there to be all these generations of Hator men?"  "Life breeds passion, passion breeds suffering, suffering breeds the yearning for relief from suffering.  Men throng to Sant from all parts, in order to have the scars of their souls healed."  "In place of hatred of pleasure, which all can understand, what simple formula do you offer?"  "Iron obedience to duty," answered Spadevil.  "And if they ask 'How far is this consistent with hatred of pleasure?' what will your pronouncement be?"  "I do not answer them, but I answer you, Maskull, who ask the question.  Hatred is passion, and all passion springs from the dark fires of self.  Do not hate pleasure at all, but pass it by on one side, calm and undisturbed."  "What is the criterion of pleasure?  How can we always recognise it, in order to avoid it?"  "Rigidly follow duty, and such questions will not arise."  Later in the afternoon, Tydomin timidly placed her fingers on Spadevil's arm.  "Fearful doubts are in my mind," she said.  "This expedition to Sant may turn out badly.  I have seen a vision of you, Spadevil, and myself lying dead and covered in blood, but Maskull was not there."  "We may drop the torch, but it will not be extinguished, and others will raise it."  "Show me a sign that you are not as other men--so that I may know that our blood will not be wasted."  Spadevil regarded her sternly.  "I am not a magician.  I don't persuade the senses, but the soul.  Does your duty call you to Sant, Tydomin?  Then go there.  Does it not call you to Sant?  Then go no farther.  Is not this simple?  What signs are necessary?"  "Did I not see you dispel those spouts of lightning?  No common man could have done that."  "Who knows what any man can do?  This man can do one thing, that man can do another.  But what all men can do is their duty; and to open their eyes to this, I must go to Sant, and if necessary lay down my life.  Will you not still accompany me?"  "Yes," said Tydomin, "I will follow you to the end.  It is all the more essential, because I keep on displeasing you with my remarks, and that means I have not yet learned my lesson properly."  "Do not be humble, for humility is only self-judgment, and while we are thinking of self, we must be neglecting some action we could be planning or shaping in our mind."  Tydomin continued to be uneasy and preoccupied.  "Why was Maskull not in the picture?" she asked.  "You dwell on this foreboding because you imagine it is tragical. There is nothing tragical in death, Tydomin, nor in life.  There is only right and wrong.  What arises from right or wrong action does not matter.  We are not gods, constructing a world, but simple men and women, doing our immediate duty.  We may die in Sant--so you have seen it; but the truth will go on living."  "Spadevil, why do you choose Sant to start your work in?" asked Maskull.  "These men with fixed ideas seem to me the least likely of any to follow a new light."  "Where a bad tree thrives, a good tree will flourish.  But where no tree at all can be found, nothing will grow."  "I understand you," said Maskull.  "Here perhaps we are going to martyrdom, but elsewhere we should resemble men preaching to cattle."  Shortly before sunset they arrived at the extremity of the upland plain, above which towered the black cliffs of the Sant Levels.  A dizzy, artificially constructed staircase, of more than a thousand steps of varying depth, twisting and forking in order to conform to the angles of the precipices, led to the world overhead.  In the place where they stood they were sheltered from the cutting winds. Branchspell, radiantly shining at last, but on the point of sinking, filled the cloudy sky with violent, lurid colors, some of the combinations of which were new to Maskull.  The circle of the horizon was so gigantic, that had he been suddenly carried back to Earth, he would by comparison have fancied himself to be moving beneath the dome of some little, closed-in cathedral.  He realised that he was on a foreign planet.  But he was not stirred or uplifted by the knowledge; he was conscious only of moral ideas.  Looking backward, he saw the plain, which for several miles past had been without vegetation, stretching back away to Disscourn.  So regular had been the ascent, and so great was the distance, that the huge pyramid looked nothing more than a slight swelling on the face of the earth.  Spadevil stopped, and gazed over the landscape in silence.  In the evening sunlight his form looked more dense, dark, and real than ever before.  His features were set hard in grimness.  He turned around to his companions.  "What is the greatest wonder, in all this wonderful scene?" he demanded.  "Acquaint us," said Maskull.  "All that you see is born from pleasure, and moves on, from pleasure to pleasure.  Nowhere is right to be found.  It is Shaping's world."  "There is another wonder," said Tydomin, and she pointed her finger toward the sky overhead.  A small cloud, so low down that it was perhaps not more than five hundred feet above them, was sailing along in front of the dark wall of cliff.  It was in the exact shape of an open human hand, with downward-pointing fingers.  It was stained crimson by the sun; and one or two tiny cloudlets beneath the fingers looked like falling drops of blood.  "Who can doubt now that our death is close at hand?" said Tydomin. "I have been close to death twice today.  The first time I was ready, but now I am more ready, for I shall die side by side with the man who has given me my first happiness."  "Do not think of death, but of right persistence," replied Spadevil. "I am not here to tremble before Shaping's portents; but to snatch men from him."  He at once proceeded to lead the way up the staircase.  Tydomin gazed upward after him for a moment, with an odd, worshiping light in her eyes.  Then she followed him, the second of the party.  Maskull climbed last.  He was travel stained, unkempt, and very tired; but his soul was at peace.  As they steadily ascended the almost perpendicular stairs, the sun got higher in the sky.  Its light dyed their bodies a ruddy gold.  They gained the top.  There they found rolling in front of them, as far as the eye could see, a barren desert of white sand, broken here and there by large, jagged masses of black rock.  Tracts of the sand were reddened by the sinking sun.  The vast expanse of sky was filled by evil-shaped clouds and wild colors.  The freezing wind, flurrying across the desert, drove the fine particles of sand painfully against their faces.  "Where now do you take us?" asked Maskull.  "He who guards the old wisdom of Sant must give up that wisdom to me, that I may change it.  What he says, others will say.  I go to find Maulger."  "And where will you seek him, in this bare country?"  Spadevil struck off toward the north unhesitatingly.  "It is not so far," he said.  "It is his custom to be in that part where Sant overhangs the Wombflash Forest.  Perhaps he will be there, but I cannot say."  Maskull glanced toward Tydomin.  Her sunken cheeks, and the dark circles beneath her eyes told of her extreme weariness.  "The woman is tired, Spadevil," he said.  She smiled, "It's but another step into the land of death.  I can manage it.  Give me your arm, Maskull."  He put his arm around her waist, and supported her along that way.  "The sun is now sinking," said Maskull.  "Will we get there before dark?"  "Fear nothing, Maskull and Tydomin; this pain is eating up the evil in your nature.  The road you are walking cannot remain unwalked.  We shall arrive before dark."  The sun then disappeared behind the far-distant ridges that formed the western boundary of the Ifdawn Marest.  The sky blazed up into more vivid colors.  The wind grew colder.  They passed some pools of colourless gnawl water, round the banks of which were planted fruit trees.  Maskull ate some of the fruit.  It was hard, bitter, and astringent; he could not get rid of the taste, but he felt braced and invigorated by the downward-flowing juices. No other trees or shrubs were to be seen anywhere.  No animals appeared, no birds or insects.  It was a desolate land.  A mile or two passed, when they again approached the edge of the plateau.  Far down, beneath their feet, the great Wombflash Forest began.  But daylight had vanished there; Maskull's eyes rested only on a vague darkness.  He faintly heard what sounded like the distant sighing of innumerable treetops.  In the rapidly darkening twilight, they came abruptly on a man.  He was standing in a pool, on one leg.  A pile of boulders had hidden him from their view.  The water came as far up as his calf.  A trifork, similar to the one Maskull had seen on Disscourn, but smaller, had been stuck in the mud close by his hand.  They stopped by the side of the pond, and waited.  Immediately he became aware of their presence, the man set down his other leg, and waded out of the water toward them, picking up his trifork in doing so.  "This is not Maulger, but Catice," said Spadevil.  "Maulger is dead," said Catice, speaking the same tongue as Spadevil, but with an even harsher accent, so that the tympanum of Maskull's ear was affected painfully.  The latter saw before him a bowed, powerful individual, advanced in years.  He wore nothing but a scanty loincloth.  His trunk was long and heavy, but his legs were rather short.  His face was beardless, lemon-coloured, and anxious-looking.  It was disfigured by a number of longitudinal ruts, a quarter of an inch deep, the cavities of which seemed clogged with ancient dirt.  The hair of his head was black and sparse.  Instead of the twin membranous organs of Spadevil, he possessed but one; and this was in the centre of his brow.  Spadevil's dark, solid person stood out from the rest like a reality among dreams.  "Has the trifork passed to you?" he demanded.  "Yes.  Why have you brought this woman to Sant?"  "I have brought another thing to Sant.  I have brought the new faith."  Catice stood motionless, and looked troubled.  "State it."  "Shall I speak with many words, or few words?"  "If you wish to say what is not, many words will not suffice.  If you wish to say what is, a few words will be enough."  Spadevil frowned.  "To hate pleasure brings pride with it.  Pride is a pleasure.  To kill pleasure, we must attach ourselves to duty.  While the mind is planning right action, it has no time to think of pleasure."  "Is that the whole?" asked Catice.  "The truth is simple, even for the simplest man."  "Do you destroy Hator, and all his generations, with a single word?"  "I destroy nature, and set up law."  A long silence followed.  "My probe is double," said Spadevil.  "Suffer me to double yours, and you will see as I see."  "Come you here, you big man!" said Catice to Maskull.  Maskull advanced a step closer.  "Do you follow Spadevil in his new faith?"  "As far as death," exclaimed Maskull.  Catice picked up a flint.  "With this stone I strike out one of your two probes.  When you have but one, you will see with me, and you will recollect with Spadevil.  Choose you then the superior faith, and I shall obey your choice."  "Endure this little pain, Maskull, for the sake of future men," said Spadevil.  "The pain is nothing," replied Maskull, "but I fear the result."  "Permit me, although I am only a woman, to take his place, Catice," said Tydomin, stretching out her hand.  He struck at it violently with the flint, and gashed it from wrist to thumb; the pale carmine blood spouted up.  "What brings this kiss- lover to Sant?" he said.  "How does she presume to make the rules of life for the sons of Hator?"  She bit her lip, and stepped back.  "Well then, Maskull, accept!  I certainly should not have played false to Spadevil; but you hardly can."  "If he bids me, I must do it," said Maskull.  "But who knows what will come of it?"  Spadevil spoke.  "Of all the descendants of Hator, Catice is the most wholehearted and sincere.  He will trample my truth underfoot, thinking me a demon sent by Shaping, to destroy the work of this land.  But a seed will escape, and my blood and yours, Tydomin, will wash it.  Then men will know that my destroying evil is their greatest good.  But none here will live to see that."  Maskull now went quite close to Catice, and offered his head.  Catice raised his hand, and after holding the flint poised for a moment, brought it down with adroitness and force upon the left-hand probe. Maskull cried out with the pain.  The blood streamed down, and the function of the organ was destroyed.  There was a pause, while he walked to and fro, trying to staunch the blood.  "What now do you feel, Maskull?  What do you see?" inquired Tydomin anxiously.  He stopped, and stared hard at her.  "I now see straight," he said slowly.  "What does that mean?"  He continued to wipe the blood from his forehead.  He looked troubled.  "Henceforward, as long as I live, I shall fight with my nature, and refuse to feel pleasure.  And I advise you to do the same."  Spadevil gazed at him sternly.  "Do you renounce my teaching?"  Maskull, however, returned the gaze without dismay.  Spadevil's image-like clearness of form had departed for him; his frowning face he knew to be the deceptive portico of a weak and confused intellect.  "It is false."  "Is it false to sacrifice oneself for another?" demanded Tydomin.  "I can't argue as yet," said Maskull.  "At this moment the world with its sweetness seems to me a sort of charnel house.  I feel a loathing for everything in it, including myself.  I know no more."  "Is there no duty?" asked Spadevil, in a harsh tone.  "It appears to me but a cloak under which we share the pleasure of other people."  Tydomin pulled at Spadevil's arm.  "Maskull has betrayed you, as he has so many others.  Let us go."  He stood fast.  "You have changed quickly, Maskull."  Maskull, without answering him, turned to Catice.  "Why do men go on living in this soft, shameful world, when they can kill themselves?"  "Pain is the native air of Surtur's children.  To what other air do you wish to escape?"  "Surtur's children?  Is not Surtur Shaping?"  "It is the greatest of lies.  It is Shaping's masterpiece."  "Answer, Maskull!" said Spadevil.  "Do you repudiate right action?"  "Leave me alone.  Go back!  I am not thinking of you, and your ideas. I wish you no harm."  The darkness came on fast.  There was another prolonged silence.  Catice threw away the flint, and picked up his staff.  "The woman must return home," he said.  "She was persuaded here, and did not come freely.  You, Spadevil, must die--backslider as you are!"  Tydomin said quietly, "He has no power to enforce this.  Are you going to allow the truth to fall to the ground, Spadevil?"  "It will not perish by my death, but by my efforts to escape from death.  Catice, I accept your judgment."  Tydomin smiled.  "For my part, I am too tired to walk farther today, so I shall die with him."  Catice said to Maskull, "Prove your sincerity.  Kill this man and his mistress, according to the laws of Hator."  "I can't do that.  I have travelled in friendship with them."  "You denied duty; and now you must do your duty," said Spadevil, calmly stroking his beard.  "Whatever law you accept, You must obey, without turning to right or left.  Your law commands that we must be stoned; and it will soon be dark."  "Have you not even this amount of manhood?" exclaimed Tydomin.  Maskull moved heavily.  "Be my witness, Catice, that the thing was forced on me."  "Hator is looking on, and approving," replied Catice.  Maskull then went apart to the pile of boulders scattered by the side of the pool.  He glanced about him, and selected two large fragments of rock, the heaviest that he thought he could carry.  With these in his arms, he staggered back.  He dropped them on the ground, and stood, recovering his breath. When he could speak again, he said, "I have a bad heart for the business.  Is there no alternative?  Sleep here tonight, Spadevil, and in the morning go back to where you have come from.  No one shall harm you."  Spadevil's ironic smile was lost in the gloom.  "Shall I brood again, Maskull, for still another year, and after that come back to Sant with other truths?  Come, waste no time, but choose the heavier stone for me, for I am stronger than Tydomin."  Maskull lifted one of the rocks, and stepped out four full paces. Spadevil confronted him, erect, and waited tranquilly.  The huge stone hurtled through the air.  Its flight looked like a dark shadow.  It struck Spadevil full in the face, crushing his features, and breaking his neck.  He died instantaneously.  Tydomin looked away from the fallen man.  "Be very quick, Maskull, and don't let me keep him waiting."  He panted, and raised the second stone.  She placed herself in front of Spadevil's body, and stood there, unsmiling and cold.  The blow caught her between breast and chin, and she fell.  Maskull went to her, and, kneeling on the ground, half-raised her in his arms.  There she breathed out her last sighs.  After that, he laid her down again, and rested heavily on his hands, while he peered into the dead face.  The transition from its heroic, spiritual expression to the vulgar and grinning mask of Crystalman came like a flash; but he saw it.  He stood up in the darkness, and pulled Catice toward him.  "Is that the true likeness of Shaping?"  "It is Shaping stripped of illusion."  "How comes this horrible world to exist?"  Catice did not answer.  "Who is Surtur?"  "You will get nearer to him tomorrow; but not here."  "I am wading through too much blood," said Maskull.  "Nothing good can come of it."  "Do not fear change and destruction; but laughter and joy."  Maskull meditated.  "Tell me, Catice.  If I had elected to follow Spadevil, would you really have accepted his faith?"  "He was a great-souled man," replied Catice.  "I see that the pride of our men is only another sprouting-out of pleasure.  Tomorrow I too shall leave Sant, to reflect on all this."  Maskull shuddered.  "Then these two deaths were not a necessity, but a crime!"  "His part was played and henceforward the woman would have dragged down his ideas, with her soft love and loyalty.  Regret nothing, stranger, but go away at once out of the land."  "Tonight?  Where shall I go?"  "To Wombflash, where you will meet the deepest minds.  I will put you on the way."  He linked his arm in Maskull's, and they walked away into the night. For a mile or more they skirted the edge of the precipice.  The wind was searching, and drove grit into their faces.  Through the rifts of the clouds, stars, faint and brilliant, appeared.  Maskull saw no familiar constellations.  He wondered if the sun of earth was visible, and if so which one it was.  They came to the head of a rough staircase, leading down the cliffside.  It resembled the one by which he had come up; but this descended to the Wombflash Forest.  "That is your path," said Catice, "and I shall not come any farther."  Maskull detained him.  "Say just this, before we part company--why does pleasure appear so shameful to us?"  "Because in feeling pleasure, we forget our home."  "And that is--"  "Muspel," answered Catice.  Having made this reply, he disengaged himself, and, turning his back, disappeared into the darkness.  Maskull stumbled down the staircase as best he could.  He was tired, but contemptuous of his pains.  His uninjured probe began to discharge matter.  He lowered himself from step to step during what seemed an interminable time.  The rustling and sighing of the trees grew louder as he approached the bottom; the air became still and warm.  He at last reached level ground.  Still attempting to proceed, he began to trip over roots, and to collide with tree trunks.  After this had happened a few times, he determined to go no farther that night.  He heaped together some dry leaves for a pillow, and immediately flung himself down to sleep.  Deep and heavy unconsciousness seized him almost instantly.    Chapter 13  THE WOMBFLASH FOREST  He awoke to his third day on Tormance.  His limbs ached.  He lay on his side, looking stupidly at his surroundings.  The forest was like night, but that period of the night when the grey dawn is about to break and objects begin to be guessed at, rather than seen.  Two or three amazing shadowy shapes, as broad as houses, loomed up out of the twilight.  He did not realise that they were trees, until he turned over on his back and followed their course upward.  Far overhead, so high up that he dared not calculate the height, he saw their tops glittering in the sunlight, against a tiny patch of blue sky.  Clouds of mist, rolling over the floor of the forest, kept interrupting his view.  In their silent passage they were like phantoms flitting among the trees.  The leaves underneath him were sodden, and heavy drops of moisture splashed onto his head from time to time.  He continued lying there, trying to reconstruct the events of the preceding day.  His brain was lethargic and confused.  Something terrible had happened, but what it was he could not for a long time recollect.  Then suddenly there came before his eyes that ghastly closing scene at dusk on the Sant plateau--Spadevil's crushed and bloody features and Tydomin's dying sighs....  He shuddered convulsively, and felt sick.  The peculiar moral outlook that had dictated these brutal murders had departed from him during the night, and now he recognised what he had done!  During the whole of the previous day he seemed to have been labouring under a series of heavy enchantments.  First Oceaxe had enslaved him, then Tydomin, then Spadevil, and lastly Catice.  They had forced him to murder and violate; he had guessed nothing, but had imagined that he was travelling as a free and enlightened stranger. What was this nightmare journey for--and would it continue, in the same way? ...  The silence of the forest was so intense that he heard no sound except the pumping of blood through his arteries.  Putting his hand to his face, he found that his remaining probe had disappeared and that he was in possession of three eyes.  The third eye was on his forehead, where the old sorb had been.  He could not guess its use.  He still had his third arm, but it was nerveless.  Now he puzzled his head for a long time, trying unsuccessfully to recall that name which had been the last word spoken by Catice.  He got up, with the intention of resuming his journey.  He had no toilet to make, and no meal to prepare.  The forest was tremendous. The nearest tree appeared to him to have a circumference of at least a hundred feet.  Other dim boles looked equally large.  But what gave the scene its aspect of immensity was the vast spaces separating tree from tree.  It was like some gigantic, supernatural hall in a life after death.  The lowest branches were fifty yards or more from the ground.  There was no underbrush; the soil was carpeted only by the dead, wet leaves.  He looked all around him, to find his direction, but the cliffs of Sant, which he had descended, were invisible-- every way was like every other way, he had no idea which quarter to attack.  He grew frightened, and muttered to himself.  Craning his neck back, he stared upward and tried to discover the points of the compass from the direction of the sunlight, but it was impossible.  While he was standing there, anxious and hesitating, he heard the drum taps.  The rhythmical beats proceeded from some distance off. The unseen drummer seemed to be marching through the forest, away from him.  "Surtur!" he said, under his breath.  The next moment he marvelled at himself for uttering the name.  That mysterious being had not been in his thoughts, nor was there any ostensible connection between him and the drumming.  He began to reflect--but in the meantime the sounds were travelling away.  Automatically he started walking in the same direction.  The drum beats had this peculiarity--though odd and mystical, there was nothing awe-inspiring in them, but on the contrary they reminded him of some place and some life with which he was perfectly familiar. Once again they caused all his other sense impressions to appear false.  The sounds were intermittent.  They would go on for a minute, or for five minutes, and then cease for perhaps a quarter of an hour. Maskull followed them as well as he could.  He walked hard among the huge, indistinct trees, in the attempt to come up with the origin of the noise, but the same distance always seemed to separate them.  The forest from now onward descended.  The gradient was mostly gentle-- about one foot in ten--but in some places it was much steeper, and in other parts again it was practically level ground for quite long stretches.  There were great swampy marshes, through which Maskull was obliged to splash.  It was a matter of indifference to him how wet he became--if only he could catch sight of that individual with the drum.  Mile after mile was covered, and still he was no nearer to doing so.  The gloom of the forest settled down upon his spirits.  He felt despondent, tired, and savage.  He had not heard the drum beats for some while, and was half inclined to discontinue the pursuit.  Passing around a great, columnar tree trunk, he almost stumbled against a man who was standing on the farther side.  He was leaning against the trunk with one hand, in an attitude of repose.  His other hand was resting on a staff.  Maskull stopped short and started at him.  He was nearly naked, and of gigantic build.  He over-topped Maskull by a head.  His face and body were faintly phosphorescent.  His eyes-- three in number--were pale green and luminous, shining like lamps. His skin was hairless, but the hair of his head was piled up in thick, black coils, and fastened like a woman's.  His features were absolutely tranquil, but a terrible, quiet energy seemed to lie just underneath the surface.  Maskull addressed him.  "Did the drumming come from you?"  The man shook his head.  "What is your name?"  He replied in a strange, strained, twisted voice.  Maskull gathered that the name he gave was "Dreamsinter."  "What is that drumming?"  "Surtur," said Dreamsinter.  "Is it advisable for me to follow it?"  "Why?"  "Perhaps he intends me to.  He brought me here from Earth."  Dreamsinter caught hold of him, bent down, and peered into his face. "Not you, but Nightspore."  This was the first time that Maskull had heard Nightspore's name since his arrival on the planet.  He was so astonished that he could frame no more questions.  "Eat this," said Dreamsinter.  "Then we will chase the sound together."  He picked something up from the ground and handed it to Maskull.  He could not see distinctly, but it felt like a hard, round nut, of the size of a fist.  "I can't crack it."  Dreamsinter took it between his hands, and broke it into pieces. Maskull then ate some of the pulpy interior, which was intensely disagreeable.  "What am I doing in Tormance, then?" he asked.  "You came to steal Muspel-fire, to give a deeper life to men--never doubting if your soul could endure that burning."  Maskull could hardly decipher the strangled words.  "Muspel....  That's the name I've been trying to remember ever since I awoke."  Dreamsinter suddenly turned his head sideways, and appeared to listen for something.  He motioned with his hand to Maskull to keep quiet.  "Is it the drumming?"  "Hush!  They come."  He was looking toward the upper forest.  The now familiar drum rhythm was heard--this time accompanied by the tramp of marching feet.  Maskull saw, marching through the trees and heading toward them, three men in single file separated from one another by only a yard or so.  They were travelling down hill at a swift pace, and looked neither to left nor right.  They were naked.  Their figures were shining against the black background of the forest with a pale, supernatural light--green and ghostly.  When they were abreast of him, about twenty feet off, he perceived who they were.  The first man was himself--Maskull.  The second was Krag.  The third man was Nightspore.  Their faces were grim and set.  The source of the drumming was out of sight.  The sound appeared to come from some point in front of them.  Maskull and Dreamsinter put themselves in motion, to keep up with the swiftly moving marchers. At the same time a low, faint music began.  Its rhythm stepped with the drum beats, but, unlike the latter, it did not seem to proceed from any particular quarter of the forest. It resembled the subjective music heard in dreams, which accompanies the dreamer everywhere, as a sort of natural atmosphere, rendering all his experiences emotional.  It seemed to issue from an unearthly orchestra, and was strongly troubled, pathetic and tragic.  Maskull marched, and listened; and as he listened, it grew louder and stormier.  But the pulse of the drum interpenetrated all the other sounds, like the quiet beating of reality.  His emotion deepened.  He could not have said if minutes or hours were passing.  The spectral procession marched on, a little way ahead, on a path parallel with his own and Dreamsinter's.  The music pulsated violently.  Krag lifted his arm, and displayed a long, murderous-looking knife.  He sprang forward and, raising it over the phantom Maskull's back, stabbed him twice, leaving the knife in the wound the second time.  Maskull threw up his arms, and fell down dead.  Krag leaped into the forest and vanished from sight. Nightspore marched on alone, stern and unmoved.  The music rose to crescendo.  The whole dim, gigantic forest was roaring with sound.  The tones came from all sides, from above, from the ground under their feet.  It was so grandly passionate that Maskull felt his soul loosening from its bodily envelope.  He continued to follow Nightspore.  A strange brightness began to glow in front of them.  It was not daylight, but a radiance such as he had never seen before, and such as he could not have imagined to be possible.  Nightspore moved straight toward it.  Maskull felt his chest bursting.  The light flashed higher.  The awful harmonies of the music followed hard one upon another, like the waves of a wild, magic ocean....  His body was incapable of enduring such shocks, and all of a sudden he tumbled over in a faint that resembled death.    Chapter 14  POLECRAB  The morning slowly passed.  Maskull made some convulsive movements, and opened his eyes.  He sat up, blinking.  All was night-like and silent in the forest.  The strange light had gone, the music had ceased, Dreamsinter had vanished.  He fingered his beard, clotted with Tydomin's blood, and fell into a deep muse.  "According to Panawe and Catice, this forest contains wise men. Perhaps Dreamsinter was one.  Perhaps that vision I have just seen was a specimen of his wisdom.  It looked almost like an answer to my question....  I ought not to have asked about myself, but about Surtur.  Then I would have got a different answer.  I might have learned something... I might have seen him."  He remained quiet and apathetic for a bit.  "But I couldn't face that awful glare," he proceeded.  "It was bursting my body.  He warned me, too.  And so Surtur does really exist, and my journey stands for something.  But why am I here, and what can I do?  Who is Surtur?  Where is he to be found?"  Something wild came into his eyes.  "What did Dreamsinter mean by his 'Not you, but Nightspore'?  Am I a secondary character--is he regarded as important; and I as unimportant?  Where is Nightspore, and what is he doing?  Am I to wait for his time and pleasure--can I originate nothing?"  He continued sitting up, with straight-extended legs.  "I must make up my mind that this is a strange journey, and that the strangest things will happen in it.  It's no use making plans, for I can't see two steps ahead--everything is unknown.  But one thing's evident: nothing but the wildest audacity will carry me through, and I must sacrifice everything else to that.  And therefore if Surtur shows himself again, I shall go forward to meet him, even if it means death."  Through the black, quiet aisles of the forest the drum beats came again.  The sound was a long way off and very faint.  It was like the last mutterings of thunder after a heavy storm.  Maskull listened, without getting up.  The drumming faded into silence, and did not return.  He smiled queerly, and said aloud, "Thanks, Surtur!  I accept the omen."  When he was about to get up, he found that the shrivelled skin that had been his third arm was flapping disconcertingly with every movement of his body.  He made perforations in it all around, as close to his chest as possible, with the fingernails of both hands; then he carefully twisted it off.  In that world of rapid growth and ungrowth he judged that the stump would soon disappear.  After that, he rose and peered into the darkness.  The forest at that point sloped rather steeply and, without thinking twice about it, he took the downhill direction, never doubting it would bring him somewhere.  As soon as he started walking, his temper became gloomy and morose--he was shaken, tired, dirty, and languid with hunger; moreover, he realised that the walk was not going to be a short one.  Be that as it may, he determined to sit down no more until the whole dismal forest was at his back.  One after another the shadowy, houselike trees were observed, avoided, and passed.  Far overhead the little patch of glowing sky was still always visible; otherwise he had no clue to the time of day.  He continued tramping sullenly down the slope for many damp, slippery miles--in some places through bogs.  When, presently, the twilight seemed to thin, he guessed that the open world was not far away.  The forest grew more palpable and grey, and now he saw its majesty better.  The tree trunks were like round towers, and so wide were the intervals that they resembled natural amphitheatres.  He could not make out the colour of the bark.  Everything he saw amazed him, but his admiration was of the growling, grudging kind.  The difference in light between the forest behind him and the forest ahead became so marked that he could no longer doubt that he was on the point of coming out.  Real light was in front of him; looking back, he found he had a shadow.  The trunks acquired a reddish tint.  He quickened his pace. As the minutes went by, the bright patch ahead grew luminous and vivid; it had a tinge of blue.  He also imagined that he heard the sound of surf.  All that part of the forest toward which he was moving became rich with colour.  The boles of the trees were of a deep, dark red; their leaves, high above his head, were ulfire-hued; the dead leaves on the ground were of a colour he could not name.  At the same time he discovered the use of his third eye.  By adding a third angle to his sight, every object he looked at stood out in greater relief.  The world looked less flat--more realistic and significant.  He had a stronger attraction toward his surroundings; he seemed somehow to lose his egotism, and to become free and thoughtful.  Now through the last trees he saw full daylight.  Less than half a mile separated him from the border of the forest, and, eager to discover what lay beyond, he broke into a run.  He heard the surf louder.  It was a peculiar hissing sound that could proceed only from water, yet was unlike the sea.  Almost immediately he came within sight of an enormous horizon of dancing waves, which he knew must be the Sinking Sea.  He fell back into a quick walk, continuing to stare hard.  The wind that met him was hot, fresh and sweet.  When he arrived at the final fringe of forest, which joined the wide sands of the shore without any change of level, he leaned with his back to a great tree and gazed his fill, motionless, at what lay in front of him.  The sands continued east and west in a straight line, broken only here and there by a few creeks.  They were of a brilliant orange colour, but there were patches of violet.  The forest appeared to stand sentinel over the shore for its entire length.  Everything else was sea and sky--he had never seen so much water.  The semicircle of the skyline was so vast that he might have imagined himself on a flat world, with a range of vision determined only by the power of his eye.  The sea was unlike any sea on Earth.  It resembled an immense liquid opal.  On a body colour of rich, magnificent emerald-green, flashes of red, yellow, and blue were everywhere shooting up and vanishing.  The wave motion was extraordinary.  Pinnacles of water were slowly formed until they attained a height of perhaps ten or twenty feet, when they would suddenly sink downward and outward, creating in their descent a series of concentric rings for long distances around them.  Quickly moving currents, like rivers in the sea, could be seen, racing away from land; they were of a darker green and bore no pinnacles.  Where the sea met the shore, the waves rushed over the sands far in, with almost sinister rapidity--accompanied by a weird, hissing, spitting sound, which was what Maskull had heard.  The green tongues rolled in without foam.  About twenty miles distant, as he judged, directly opposite him, a long, low island stood up from the sea, black and not distinguished in outline.  It was Swaylone's Island.  Maskull was less interested in that than in the blue sunset that glowed behind its back.  Alppain had set, but the whole northern sky was plunged into the minor key by its afterlight.  Branchspell in the zenith was white and overpowering, the day was cloudless and terrifically hot; but where the blue sun had sunk, a sombre shadow seemed to overhang the world. Maskull had a feeling of disintegration--just as if two chemically distinct forces were simultaneously acting upon the cells of his body.  Since the afterglow of Alppain affected him like this, he thought it more than likely that he would never be able to face that sun itself, and go on living.  Still, some modification might happen to him that would make it possible.  The sea tempted him.  He made up his mind to bathe, and at once walked toward the shore.  The instant he stepped outside the shadow line of the forest trees, the blinding rays of the sun beat down on him so savagely that for a few minutes he felt sick and his head swam.  He trod quickly across the sands.  The orange-coloured parts were nearly hot enough to roast food, he judged, but the violet parts were like fire itself.  He stepped on a patch in ignorance, and immediately jumped high into the air with a startled yell.  The sea was voluptuously warm.  It would not bear his weight, so he determined to try swimming.  First of all he stripped off his skin garment, washed it thoroughly with sand and water, and laid it in the sun to dry.  Then he scrubbed himself as well as he could and washed out his beard and hair.  After that, he waded in a long way, until the water reached his breast, and took to swimming--avoiding the spouts as far as possible  He found it no pastime.  The water was everywhere of unequal density.  In some places he could swim, in others he could barely save himself from drowning, in others again he could not force himself beneath the surface at all.  There were no outward signs to show what the water ahead held in store for him. The whole business was most dangerous.  He came out, feeling clean and invigorated.  For a time he walked up and down the sands, drying himself in the hot sunshine and looking around him.  He was a naked stranger in a huge, foreign, mystical world, and whichever way he turned, unknown and threatening forces were glaring at him.  The gigantic, white, withering Branchspell, the awful, body-changing Alppain, the beautiful, deadly, treacherous sea, the dark and eerie Swaylone's Island, the spirit-crushing forest out of which he had just escaped--to all these mighty powers, surrounding him on every side, what resources had he, a feeble, ignorant traveller to oppose, from a tiny planet on the other side of space, to avoid being utterly destroyed? ... Then he smiled to himself.  "I've already been here two days, and still I survive.  I have luck--and with that one can balance the universe.  But what is luck--a verbal expression, or a thing?"  As he was putting on his skin, which was now dry, the answer came to him, and this time he was grave.  "Surtur brought me here, and Surtur is watching over me.  That is my 'luck.'...  But what is Surtur in this world? ... How is he able to protect me against the blind and ungovernable forces of nature?  Is he stronger than Nature? ..."  Hungry as he was for food, he was hungrier still for human society, for he wished to inquire about all these things.  He asked himself which way he should turn his steps.  There were only two ways; along the shore, either east or west.  The nearest creek lay to the east, cutting the sands about a mile away.  He walked toward it.  The forest face was forbidding and enormously high.  It was so squarely turned to the sea that it looked as though it had been planed by tools.  Maskull strode along in the shade of the trees, but kept his head constantly turned away from them, toward the sea-- there it was more cheerful.  The creek, when he reached it, proved to be broad and flat-banked.  It was not a river, but an arm of the sea. Its still, dark green water curved around a bend out of sight, into the forest.  The trees on both banks overhung the water, so that it was completely in shadow.  He went as far as the bend, beyond which another short reach appeared.  A man was sitting on a narrow shelf of bank, with his feet in the water.  He was clothed in a coarse, rough hide, which left his limbs bare.  He was short, thick, and sturdy, with short legs and a long, powerful arms, terminating in hands of an extraordinary size. He was oldish.  His face was plain, slablike, and expressionless; it was full of wrinkles, and walnut-coloured.  Both face and head were bald, and his skin was tough and leathery.  He seemed to be some sort of peasant, or fisherman; there was no trace in his face of thought for others, or delicacy of feeling.  He possessed three eyes, of different colors--jade-green, blue, and ulfire.  In front of him, riding on the water, moored to the bank, was an elementary raft, consisting of the branches of trees, clumsily corded together.  Maskull addressed him.  "Are you another of the wise men of the Wombflash Forest?"  The man answered him in a gruff, husky voice, looking up as he did so.  "I'm a fisherman.  I know nothing about wisdom."  "What name do you go by?"  "Polecrab.  What's yours?"  "Maskull.  If you're a fisherman, you ought to have fish.  I'm famishing."  Polecrab grunted, and paused a minute before answering.  "There's fish enough.  My dinner is cooking in the sands now.  It's easy enough to get you some more."  Maskull found this a pleasant speech.  "But how long will it take?" he asked.  The man slid the palms of his hands together, producing a shrill, screeching noise.  He lifted his feet from the water, and clambered onto the bank.  In a minute or two a curious little beast came crawling up to his feet, turning its face and eyes up affectionately, like a dog.  It was about two feet long, and somewhat resembled a small seal, but had six legs, ending in strong claws.  "Arg, go fish!" said Polecrab hoarsely.  The animal immediately tumbled off the bank into the water.  It swam gracefully to the middle of the creek and made a pivotal dive beneath the surface, where it remained a great while.  "Simple fishing," remarked Maskull.  "But what's the raft for?"  "To go to sea with.  The best fish are out at sea.  These are eatable."  "That arg seems a highly intelligent creature."  Polecrab grunted again.  "I've trained close on a hundred of them. The bigheads learn best, but they're slow swimmers.  The narrowheads swim like eels, but can't be taught.  Now I've started interbreeding them--he's one of them."  "Do you live here alone?"  "No, I've got a wife and three boys.  My wife's sleeping somewhere, but where the lads are, Shaping knows."  Maskull began to feel very much at home with this unsophisticated being.  "The raft's all crazy," he remarked, staring at it.  "If you go far out in that, you've got more pluck than I have."  "I've been to Matterplay on it," said Polecrab.  The arg reappeared and started swimming to shore, but this time clumsily, as if it were bearing a heavy weight under the surface. When it landed at its master's feet, they saw that each set of claws was clutching a fish--six in all.  Polecrab took them from it.  He proceeded to cut off the heads and tails with a sharp-edged stone which he picked up; these he threw to the arg, which devoured them without any fuss.  Polecrab beckoned to Maskull to follow him and, carrying the fish, walked toward the open shore, by the same way that he had come.  When they reached the sands, he sliced the fish, removed the entrails, and digging a shallow hole in a patch of violet sand, placed the remainder of the carcasses in it, and covered them over again.  Then he dug up his own dinner.  Maskull's nostrils quivered at the savoury smell, but he was not yet to dine.  Polecrab, turning to go with the cooked fish in his hands, said, "These are mine, not yours.  When yours are done, you can come back and join me, supposing you want company."  "How soon will that be?"  "About twenty minutes," replied the fisherman, over his shoulder.  Maskull sheltered himself in the shadows of the forest, and waited. When the time had approximately elapsed, he disinterred his meal, scorching his fingers in the operation, although it was only the surface of the sand which was so intensely hot.  Then he returned to Polecrab.  In the warm, still air and cheerful shade of the inlet, they munched in silence, looking from their food to the sluggish water, and back again.  With every mouthful Maskull felt his strength returning.  He finished before Polecrab, who ate like a man for whom time has no value.  When he had done, he stood up.  "Come and drink," he said, in his husky voice.  Maskull looked at him inquiringly.  The man led him a little way into the forest, and walked straight up to a certain tree.  At a convenient height in its trunk a hole had been tapped and plugged.  Polecrab removed the plug and put his mouth to the aperture, sucking for quite a long time, like a child at its mother's breast.  Maskull, watching him, imagined that he saw his eyes growing brighter.  When his own turn came to drink, he found the juice of the tree somewhat like coconut milk in flavour, but intoxicating.  It was a new sort of intoxication, however, for neither his will not his emotions were excited, but only his intellect--and that only in a certain way.  His thoughts and images were not freed and loosened, but on the contrary kept labouring and swelling painfully, until they reached the full beauty of an aper�u, which would then flame up in his consciousness, burst, and vanish.  After that, the whole process started over again.  But there was never a moment when he was not perfectly cool, and master of his senses.  When each had drunk twice, Polecrab replugged the hole, and they returned to their bank.  "Is it Blodsombre yet?" asked Maskull, sprawling on the ground, well content.  Polecrab resumed his old upright sitting posture, with his feet in the water.  "Just beginning," was his hoarse response.  "Then I must stay here till it's over....  Shall we talk?"  "We can," said the other, without enthusiasm.  Maskull glanced at him through half-closed lids, wondering if he were exactly what he seemed to be.  In his eyes he thought he detected a wise light.  "Have you travelled much, Polecrab?"  "Not what you would call travelling."  "You tell me you've been to Matterplay--what kind of country is that?"  "I don't know.  I went there to pick up flints."  "What countries lie beyond it?"  "Threal comes next, as you go north.  They say it's a land of mystics... I don't know."  "Mystics?"  "So I'm told....  Still farther north there's Lichstorm."  "Now we're going far afield."  "There are mountains there--and altogether it must be a very dangerous place, especially for a full-blooded man like you.  Take care of yourself."  "This is rather premature, Polecrab.  How do you know I'm going there?"  "As you've come from the south, I suppose you'll go north."  "Well, that's right enough," said Maskull, staring hard at him.  "But how do you know I've come from the south?"  "Well, then, perhaps you haven't--but there's a look of Ifdawn about you."  "What kind of look?"  "A tragical look," said Polecrab.  He never even glanced at Maskull, but was gazing at a fixed spot on the water with unblinking eyes.  "What lies beyond Lichstorm?" asked Maskull, after a minute or two.  "Barey, where you have two suns instead of one--but beyond that fact I know nothing about it....  Then comes the ocean."  "And what's on the other side of the ocean?"  "That you must find out for yourself, for I doubt if anybody has ever crossed it and come back."  Maskull was silent for a little while.  "How is it that your people are so unadventurous?  I seem to be the only one travelling from curiosity."  "What do you mean by 'your people'?"  "True--you don't know that I don't belong to your planet at all. I've come from another world, Polecrab."  "What to find?"  "I came here with Krag and Nightspore--to follow Surtur.  I must have fainted the moment I arrived.  When I sat up, it was night and the others had--vanished.  Since then I've been travelling at random."  Polecrab scratched his nose.  "You haven't found Surtur yet?"  "I've heard his drum taps frequently.  In the forest this morning I came quite close to him.  Then two days ago, in the Lusion Plain, I saw a vision--a being in man's shape, who called himself Surtur."  "Well, maybe it was Surtur."  "No, that's impossible," replied Maskull reflectively.  "It was Crystalman.  And it isn't a question of my suspecting it--I know it."  "How?"  "Because this is Crystalman's world, and Surtur's world is something quite different."  "That's queer, then," said Polecrab.  "Since I've come out of that forest," proceeded Maskull, talking half to himself, "a change has come over me, and I see things differently. Everything here looks much more solid and real in my eyes than in other places so much so that I can't entertain the least doubt of its existence.  It not only looks real, it is real--and on that I would stake my life....  But at the same time that it's real, it is false."  "Like a dream?"  "No--not at all like a dream, and that's just what I want to explain.  This world of yours--and perhaps of mine too, for that matter--doesn't give me the slightest impression of a dream, or an illusion, or anything of that sort.  I know it's really here at this moment, and it's exactly as we're seeing it, you and I.  Yet it's false.  It's false in this sense, Polecrab.  Side by side with it another world exists, and that other world is the true one, and this one is all false and deceitful, to the very core.  And so it occurs to me that reality and falseness are two words for the same thing."  "Perhaps there is such another world," said Polecrab huskily.  "But did that vision also seem real and false to you?"  "Very real, but not false then, for then I didn't understand all this.  But just because it was real, it couldn't have been Surtur, who has no connection with reality."  "Didn't those drum taps sound real to you?"  "I had to hear them with my ears, and so they sounded real to me. Still, they were somehow different, and they certainly came from Surtur.  If I didn't hear them correctly, that was my fault and not his."  Polecrab growled a little.  "If Surtur chooses to speak to you in that fashion, it appears he's trying to say something."  "What else can I think?  But, Polecrab, what's your opinion--is he calling me to the life after death?"  The old man stirred uneasily.  "I'm a fisherman," he said, after a minute or two.  "I live by killing, and so does everybody.  This life seems to me all wrong.  So maybe life of any kind is wrong, and Surtur's world is not life at all, but something else."  "Yes, but will death lead me to it, whatever it is?"  "Ask the dead," said Polecrab, "and not a living man."  Maskull continued.  "In the forest I heard music and saw a light, which could not have belonged to this world.  They were too strong for my senses, and I must have fainted for a long time.  There was a vision as well, in which I saw myself killed, while Nightspore walked on toward the light, alone."  Polecrab uttered his grunt.  "You have enough to think over."  A short silence ensued, which was broken by Maskull.  "So strong is my sense of the untruth of this present life, that it may come to my putting an end to myself."  The fisherman remained quiet and immobile.  Maskull lay on his stomach, propped his face on his hands, and stared at him.  "What do you think, Polecrab?  Is it possible for any man, while in the body, to gain a closer view of that other world than I have done?"  "I am an ignorant man, stranger, so I can't say.  Perhaps there are many others like you who would gladly know."  "Where?  I should like to meet them."  "Do you think you were made of one stuff, and the rest of mankind of another stuff?"  "I can't be so presumptuous.  Possibly all men are reaching out toward Muspel, in most cases without being aware of it."  "In the wrong direction," said Polecrab.  Maskull gave him a strange look.  "How so?"  "I don't speak from my own wisdom," said Polecrab, "for I have none; but I have just now recalled what Broodviol once told me, when I was a young man, and he was an old one.  He said that Crystalman tries to turn all things into one, and that whichever way his shapes march, in order to escape from him, they find themselves again face to face with Crystalman, and are changed into new crystals.  But that this marching of shapes (which we call 'forking') springs from the unconscious desire to find Surtur, but is in the opposite direction to the right one.  For Surtur's world does not lie on this side of the one, which was the beginning of life, but on the other side; and to get to it we must repass through the one.  But this can only be by renouncing our self-life, and reuniting ourselves to the whole of Crystalman's world.  And when this has been done, it is only the first stage of the journey; though many good men imagine it to be the whole journey....  As far as I can remember, that is what Broodviol said, but perhaps, as I was then a young and ignorant man, I may have left out words which would explain his meaning better."  Maskull, who had listened attentively to all this, remained thoughtful at the end.  "It's plain enough," he said.  "But what did he mean by our reuniting ourselves to Crystalman's world?  If it is false, are we to make ourselves false as well?"  "I didn't ask him that question, and you are as well qualified to answer it as I am."  "He must have meant that, as it is, we are each of us living in a false, private world of our own, a world of dreams and appetites and distorted perceptions.  By embracing the great world we certainly lose nothing in truth and reality."  Polecrab withdrew his feet from the water, stood up, yawned, and stretched his limbs.  "I have told you all I know," he said in a surly voice.  "Now let me go to sleep."  Maskull kept his eyes fixed on him, but made no reply.  The old man let himself down stiffly on to the ground, and prepared to rest.  While he was still arranging his position to his liking, a footfall sounded behind the two men, coming from the direction of the forest. Maskull twisted his neck, and saw a woman approaching them.  He at once guessed that it was Polecrab's wife.  He sat up, but the fisherman did not stir.  The woman came and stood in front of them, looking down from what appeared a great height.  Her dress was similar to her husband's, but covered her limbs more. She was young, tall, slender, and strikingly erect.  Her skin was lightly tanned, and she looked strong, but not at all peasantlike. Refinement was stamped all over her.  Her face had too much energy of expression for a woman, and she was not beautiful.  Her three great eyes kept flashing and glowing.  She had great masses of fine, yellow hair, coiled up and fastened, but so carelessly that some of the strands were flowing down her back.  When she spoke, it was in a rather weak voice, but full of lights and shades, and somehow intense passionateness never seemed to be far away from it.  "Forgiveness is asked for listening to your conversation," she said, addressing Maskull.  "I was resting behind the tree, and heard it all."  He got up slowly.  "Are you Polecrab's wife?"  "She is my wife," said Polecrab, "and her name is Gleameil.  Sit down again, stranger--and you too, wife, since you are here."  They both obeyed.  "I heard everything," repeated Gleameil.  "But what I did not hear was where you are going to, Maskull, after you have left us."  "I know no more than you do."  "Listen, then.  There's only one place for you to go to, and that is Swaylone's Island.  I will ferry you across myself before sunset."  "What shall I find there?"  "He may go, wife," put in the old man hoarsely, "but I won't allow you to go.  I will take him over myself."  "No, you have always put me off," said Gleameil, with some emotion. "This time I mean to go.  When Teargeld shines at night, and I sit on the shore here, listening to Earthrid's music travelling faintly across the sea, I am tortured--I can't endure it....  I have long since made up my mind to go to the island, and see what this music is.  If it's bad, if it kills me--well."  "What have I to do with the man and his music, Gleameil?" demanded Maskull.  "I think the music will answer all your questions better than Polecrab has done--and possibly in a way that will surprise you."  "What kind of music can it be to travel all those miles across the sea?"  "A peculiar kind, so we are told.  Not pleasant, but painful.  And the man that can play the instrument of Earthrid would be able to conjure up the most astonishing forms, which are not phantasms, but realities."  "That may be so," growled Polecrab.  "But I have been to the island by daylight, and what did I find there?  Human bones, new and ancient.  Those are Earthrid's victims.  And you, wife, shall not go."  "But will that music play tonight?" asked Maskull.  "Yes," replied Gleameil, gazing at him intently.  "When Teargeld rises, which is our moon."  "If Earthrid plays men to death, it appears to me that his own death is due.  In any case I should like to hear those sounds for myself. But as for taking you with me, Gleameil--women die too easily in Tormance.  I have only just now washed myself clean of the death blood of another woman."  Gleameil laughed, but said nothing.  "Now go to sleep," said Polecrab.  "When the time comes, I will take you across myself."  He lay down again, and closed his eyes.  Maskull followed his example; but Gleameil remained sitting erect, with her legs under her.  "Who was that other woman, Maskull?" she asked presently.  He did not answer, but pretended to sleep.    Chapter 15  SWALONE'S ISLAND  When he awoke, the day was not so bright, and he guessed it was late afternoon.  Polecrab and his wife were both on their feet, and another meal of fish had been cooked and was waiting for him.  "Is it decided who is to go with me?" he asked, before sitting down.  "I go," said Gleameil.  "Do you agree, Polecrab?"  The fisherman growled a little in his throat and motioned to the others to take their seats.  He took a mouthful before answering.  "Something strong is attracting her, and I can't hold her back.  I don't think I shall see you again, wife, but the lads are now nearly old enough to fend for themselves."  "Don't take dejected views," replied Gleameil sternly.  She was not eating.  "I shall come back, and make amends to you.  It's only for a night."  Maskull gazed from one to the other in perplexity.  "Let me go alone. I would be sorry if anything happened."  Gleameil shook her head.  "Don't regard this as a woman's caprice," she said.  "Even if you hadn't passed this way, I would have heard that music soon.  I have a hunger for it."  "Haven't you any such feeling, Polecrab?"  "No.  A woman is a noble and sensitive creature, and there are attractions in nature too subtle for males.  Take her with you, since she is set on it.  Maybe she's right.  Perhaps Earthrid's music will answer your questions, and hers too."  "What are your questions, Gleameil?"  The woman shed a strange smile.  "You may be sure that a question which requires music for an answer can't be put into words."  "If you are not back by the morning," remarked her husband, "I will know you are dead."  The meal was finished in a constrained silence.  Polecrab wiped his mouth, and produced a seashell from a kind of pocket.  "Will you say goodbye to the boys?  Shall I call them?"  She considered a moment.  "Yes--yes, I must see them."  He put the shell to his mouth, and blew; a loud, mournful noise passed through the air.  A few minutes later there was a sound of scurrying footsteps, and the boys were seen emerging from the forest.  Maskull looked with curiosity at the first children he had seen on Tormance.  The oldest boy was carrying the youngest on his back, while the third trotted some distance behind.  The child was let down, and all the three formed a semicircle in front of Maskull, standing staring up at him with wide-open eyes.  Polecrab looked on stolidly, but Gleameil glanced away from them, with proudly raised head and a baffling expression.  Maskull put the ages of the boys at about nine, seven, and five years, respectively; but he was calculating according to Earth time. The eldest was tall, slim, but strongly built.  He, like his brothers, was naked, and his skin from top to toe was ulfire-colored. His facial muscles indicated a wild and daring nature, and his eyes were like green fires.  The second showed promise of being a broad, powerful man.  His head was large and heavy, and drooped.  His face and skin were reddish.  His eyes were almost too sombre and penetrating for a child's.  "That one," said Polecrab, pinching the boy's ear, "may perhaps grow up to be a second Broodviol."  "Who was that?" demanded the boy, bending his head forward to hear the answer.  "A big, old man, of marvellous wisdom.  He became wise by making up his mind never to ask questions, but to find things out for himself."  "If I had not asked this question, I should not have known about him."  "That would not have mattered," replied the father.  The youngest child was paler and slighter than his brothers.  His face was mostly tranquil and expressionless, but it had this peculiarity about it, that every few minutes, without any apparent cause, it would wrinkle up and look perplexed.  At these times his eyes, which were of a tawny gold, seemed to contain secrets difficult to associate with one of his age.  "He puzzles me," said Polecrab.  "He has a soul like sap, and he's interested in nothing.  He may turn out to be the most remarkable of the bunch."  Maskull took the child in one hand, and lifted him as high as his head.  He took a good look at him, and set him down again.  The boy never changed countenance.  "What do you make of him?" asked the fisherman.  "It's on the tip of my tongue to say, but it just escapes me.  Let me drink again, and then I shall have it."  "Go and drink, then."  Maskull strode over to the tree, drank, and returned.  "In ages to come," he said, speaking deliberately, "he will be a grand and awful tradition.  A seer possibly, or even a divinity.  Watch over him well."  The eldest boy looked scornful.  "I want to be none of those things. I would like to be like that big fellow."  And he pointed his finger at Maskull.  He laughed, and showed his white teeth through his beard.  "Thanks for the compliments old warrior!" he said.  "He's great and brawny" continued the boy, "and can hold his own with other men.  Can you hold me up with one arm, as you did that child?"  Maskull complied.  "That is being a man!" exclaimed the boy.  "Enough!" said Polecrab impatiently.  "I called you lads here to say goodbye to your mother. She is going away with this man.  I think she may not return, but we don't know."  The second boy's face became suddenly inflamed.  "Is she going of her own choice?" he inquired.  "Yes," replied the father.  "Then she is bad."  He brought the words out with such force and emphasis that they sounded like the crack of a whip.  The old man cuffed him twice.  "Is it your mother you are speaking of?"  The boy stood his ground, without change of expression, but said nothing.  The youngest child spoke, for the first time.  "My mother will not come back, but she will die dancing."  Polecrab and his wife looked at one another.  "Where are you going to, Mother?" asked the eldest lad.  Gleameil bent down, and kissed him.  "To the Island."  "Well then, if you don't come back by tomorrow morning, I will go and look for you."  Maskull grew more and more uneasy in his mind.  "This seems to me to be a man's journey," he said.  "I think it would be better for you not to come, Gleameil."  "I am not to be dissuaded," she replied.  He stroked his beard in perplexity.  "Is it time to start?"  "It wants four hours to sunset, and we shall need all that."  Maskull sighed.  "I'll go to the mouth of the creek, and wait there for you and the raft.  You will wish to make your farewells, Gleameil."  He then clasped Polecrab by the hand.  "Adieu, fisherman!"  "You have repaid me well for my answers," said the old man gruffly. "But it's not your fault, and in Shaping's world the worst things happen."  The eldest boy came close to Maskull, and frowned at him.  "Farewell, big man!" he said.  "But guard my mother well, as well as you are well able to, or I shall follow you, and kill you."  Maskull walked slowly along the creek bank till he came to the bend. The glorious sunshine, and the sparkling, brilliant sea then met his eyes again; and all melancholy was swept out of his mind.  He continued as far as the seashore, and issuing out of the shadows of the forest, strolled on to the sands, and sat down in the full sunlight.  The radiance of Alppain had long since disappeared.  He drank in the hot, invigorating wind, listened to the hissing waves, and stared over the coloured sea with its pinnacles and currents, at Swaylone's Island.  "What music can that be, which tears a wife and mother away from all she loves the most?" he meditated.  "It sounds unholy.  Will it tell me what I want to know?  Can it?"  In a little while he became aware of a movement behind him, and, turning his head, he saw the raft floating along the creek, toward the open sea.  Polecrab was standing upright, propelling it with a rude pole.  He passed by Maskull, without looking at him. or making any salutation, and proceeded out to sea.  While he was wondering at this strange behaviour, Gleameil and the boys came in sight, walking along the bank of the inlet.  The eldest- born was holding her hand, and talking; and the other two were behind.  She was calm and smiling, but seemed abstracted.  "What is your husband doing with the raft?" asked Maskull.  "He's putting it in position and we shall wade out and join it," she answered, in her low-toned voice.  "But how shall we make the island, without oars or sails?"  "Don't you see that current running away from land?  See, he is approaching it.  That will take us straight there."  "But how can you get back?"  "There is a way; but we need not think of that today."  "Why shouldn't I come too?" demanded the eldest boy.  "Because the raft won't carry three.  Maskull is a heavy man."  "It doesn't matter," said the boy.  "I know where there is wood for another raft.  As soon as you have gone, I shall set to work."  Polecrab had by this time manoeuvred his flimsy craft to the position he desired, within a few yards of the current, which at that point made a sharp bend from the east.  He shouted out some words to his wife and Maskull.  Gleameil kissed her children convulsively, and broke down a little.  The eldest boy bit his lip till it bled, and tears glistened in his eyes; but the younger children stared wide- eyed, and displayed no emotion.  Gleameil now walked into the sea, followed by Maskull.  The water covered first their ankles, then their knees, but when it came as high as their waists, they were close on the raft.  Polecrab let himself down into the water, and assisted his wife to climb over the side.  When she was up, she bent down and kissed him.  No words were exchanged.  Maskull scrambled up on to the front part of the raft. The woman sat cross-legged in the stem, and seized the pole.  Polecrab shoved them off toward the current, while she worked her pole until they had got within its power.  The raft immediately began to travel swiftly away from land, with a smooth, swaying motion.  The boys waved from the shore.  Gleameil responded; but Maskull turned his back squarely to land, and gazed ahead.  Polecrab was wading back to the shore.  For upward of an hour Maskull did not change his position by an inch. No sound was heard but the splashing of the strange waves all around them, and the streamlike gurgle of the current, which threaded its way smoothly through the tossing, tumultuous sea.  From their pathway of safety, the beautiful dangers surrounding them were an exhilarating experience.  The air was fresh and clean, and the heat from Branchspell, now low in the west, was at last endurable.  The riot of sea colors had long since banished all sadness and anxiety from his heart.  Yet he felt such a grudge against the woman for selfishly forsaking those who should have been dear to her that he could not bring himself to begin a conversation.  But when, over the now enlarged shape of the dark island, he caught sight of a long chain of lofty, distant mountains, glowing salmon- pink in the evening sunlight, he felt constrained to break the silence by inquiring what they were.  "It is Lichstorm," said Gleameil.  Maskull asked no questions about it; but in turning to address her, his eyes had rested on the rapidly receding Wombflash Forest, and he continued to stare at that.  They had travelled about eight miles, and now he could better estimate the enormous height of the trees. Overtopping them, far away, he saw Sant; and he fancied, but was not quite sure, that he could distinguish Disscourn as well.  "Now that we are alone in a strange place," said Gleameil, averting her head, and looking down over the side of the raft into the water, "tell me what you thought of Polecrab."  Maskull paused before answering.  "He seemed to me like a mountain wrapped in cloud.  You see the lower buttresses, and think that is all.  But then, high up, far above the clouds, you suddenly catch sight of more mountain--and even then it is not the top."  "You read character well, and have great perception," remarked Gleameil quietly.  "Now say what I am."  "In place of a human heart, you have a wild harp, and that's all I know about you."  "What was that you said to my husband about two worlds?"  "You heard."  "Yes, I heard.  And I also am conscious of two worlds.  My husband and boys are real to me, and I love them fondly.  But there is another world for me, as there is for you, Maskull, and it makes my real world appear all false and vulgar."  "Perhaps we are seeking the same thing.  But can it be right to satisfy our self-nature at the expense of other people?"  "No, it's not right.  It is wrong, and base.  But in that other world these words have no meaning."  There was a silence.  "It's useless to discuss such topics," said Maskull.  "The choice is now out of our hands, and we must go where we are taken.  What I would rather speak about is what awaits us on the island."  "I am ignorant--except that we shall find Earthrid there."  "Who is Earthrid, and why is it called Swaylone's Island?"  "They say Earthrid came from Threal, but I know nothing else about him.  As for Swaylone, if you like I will tell you his legend."  "If you please," said Maskull.  "In a far-back age," began Gleameil, "when the seas were hot, and clouds hung heavily over the earth, and life was rich with transformations, Swaylone came to this island, on which men had never before set foot, and began to play his music--the first music in Tormance.  Nightly, when the moon shone, people used to gather on this shore behind us, and listen to the faint, sweet strains floating from over the sea.  One night, Shaping (whom you call Crystalman) was passing this way in company with Krag.  They listened a while to the music, and Shaping said 'Have you heard more beautiful sounds?  This is my world and my music.'  Krag stamped with his foot, and laughed. 'You must do better than that, if I am to admire it.  Let us pass over, and see this bungler at work.'  Shaping consented, and they passed over to the island.  Swaylone was not able to see their presence.  Shaping stood behind him, and breathed thoughts into his soul, so that his music became ten times lovelier, and people listening on that shore went mad with sick delight.  'Can any strains be nobler?' demanded Shaping.  Krag grinned and said, 'You are naturally effeminate.  Now let me try.'  Then he stood behind Swaylone, and shot ugly discords fast into his head.  His instrument was so cracked, that never since has it played right.  From that time forth Swaylone could utter only distorted music; yet it called to folk more than the other sort.  Many men crossed over to the island during his lifetime, to listen to the amazing tones, but none could endure them; all died.  After Swaylone's death, another musician took up the tale; and so the light has passed down from torch to torch, till now Earthrid bears it."  "An interesting legend," commented Maskull.  "But who is Krag?"  "They say that when the world was born, Krag was born with it--a spirit compounded of those vestiges of Muspel which Shaping did not know how to transform.  Thereafter nothing has gone right with the world, for he dogs Shaping's footsteps everywhere, and whatever the latter does, he undoes.  To love he joins death; to sex, shame; to intellect, madness; to virtue, cruelty; and to fair exteriors, bloody entrails.  These are Krag's actions, so the lovers of the world call him 'devil.'  They don't understand, Maskull, that without him the world would lose its beauty."  "Krag and beauty!" exclaimed he, with a cynical smile.  "Even so.  That same beauty which you and I are now voyaging to discover.  That beauty for whose sake I am renouncing husband, children, and happiness....  Did you imagine beauty to be pleasant?"  "Surely."  "That pleasant beauty is an insipid compound of Shaping.  To see beauty in its terrible purity, you must tear away the pleasure from it."  "Do you say I am going to seek beauty, Gleameil?  Such an idea is far from my mind."  She did not respond to his remark.  After waiting for a few minutes, to hear if she would speak again, he turned his back on her once more.  There was no more talk until they reached the island.  The air had grown chill and damp by the time they approached its shores.  Branchspell was on the point of touching the sea.  The Island appeared to be some three or four miles in length.  There were first of all broad sands, then low, dark cliffs, and behind these a wilderness of insignificant, swelling hills, entirely devoid of vegetation.  The current bore them to within a hundred yards of the coast, when it made a sharp angle, and proceeded to skirt the length of the land.  Gleameil jumped overboard, and began swimming to shore.  Maskull followed her example, and the raft, abandoned, was rapidly borne away by the current.  They soon touched ground, and were able to wade the rest of the way.  By the time they reached dry land, the sun had set.  Gleameil made straight for the hills; and Maskull, after casting a single glance at the low, dim outline of the Wombflash Forest, followed her.  The cliffs were soon scrambled up.  Then the ascent was gentle and easy, while the rich, dry, brown mould was good to walk upon.  A little way off, on their left, something white was shining.  "You need not go to it," said the woman.  "It can be nothing else than one of those skeletons Polecrab talked about.  And look--there is another one over there!"  "This brings it home!" remarked Maskull, smiling.  "There is nothing comical in having died for beauty," said Gleameil, bending her brows at him.  And when in the course of their walk he saw the innumerable human bones, from gleaming white to dirty yellow, lying scattered about, as if it were a naked graveyard among the hills, he agreed with her, and fell into a sombre mood.  It was still light when they reached the highest point, and could set eyes on the other side.  The sea to the north of the island was in no way different from that which they had crossed, but its lively colors were fast becoming invisible.  "That is Matterplay," said the woman, pointing her finger toward some low land on the horizon, which seemed to be even farther off than Wombflash.  "I wonder how Digrung passed over," meditated Maskull.  Not far away, in a hollow enclosed by a circle of little hills, they saw a small, circular lake, not more than half a mile in diameter. The sunset colors of the sky were reflected in its waters.  "That must be Irontick," remarked Gleameil.  "What is that?"  "I have heard that it's the instrument Earthrid plays on."  "We are getting close," responded he.  "Let us go and investigate."  When they drew nearer, they observed that a man was reclining on the farther side, in an attitude of sleep.  "If that's not the man himself, who can it be?" said Maskull.  "Let's get across the water, if it will bear us; it will save time."  He now assumed the lead, and took running strides down the slope which bounded the lake on that side.  Gleameil followed him with greater dignity, keeping her eyes fixed on the recumbent man as if fascinated.  When Maskull reached the water's edge, he tried it with one foot, to discover if it would carry his weight.  Something unusual in its appearance led him to have doubts.  It was a tranquil, dark, and beautifully reflecting sheet of water; it resembled a mirror of liquid metal.  Finding that it would bear him, and that nothing happened, he placed his second foot on its surface. Instantly he sustained a violent shock throughout his body, as from a powerful electric current; and he was hurled in a tumbled heap back on to the bank.  He picked himself up, brushed the dirt off his person, and started walking around the lake.  Gleameil joined him, and they completed the half circuit together.  They came to the man, and Maskull prodded him with his foot.  He woke up, and blinked at them.  His face was pale, weak, and vacant-looking, and had a disagreeable expression.  There were thin sprouts of black hair on his chin and head.  On his forehead, in place of a third eye, he possessed a perfectly circular organ, with elaborate convolutions, like an ear. He had an unpleasant smell.  He appeared to be of young middle age.  "Wake up, man," said Maskull sharply, "and tell us if you are Earthrid."  "What time is it?" counterquestioned the man.  "Does it want long to moonrise?"  Without appearing to care about an answer, he sat up, and turning away from them, began to scoop up the loose soil with his hand, and to eat it halfheartedly.  "Now, how can you eat that filth?" demanded Maskull, in disgust.  "Don't be angry, Maskull," said Gleameil, laying hold of his arm, and flushing a little.  "It is Earthrid--the man who is to help us."  "He has not said so."  "I am Earthrid," said the other, in his weak and muffled voice, which, however, suddenly struck Maskull as being autocratic.  "What do you want here?  Or rather, you had better get away as quickly as you can, for it will be too late when Teargeld rises."  "You need not explain," exclaimed Maskull.  "We know your reputation, and we have come to hear your music.  But what's that organ for on your forehead?"  Earthrid glared, and smiled, and glared again.  "That is for rhythm, which is what changes noise into music.  Don't stand and argue, but go away.  It is no pleasure to me to people the island with corpses.  They corrupt the air, and do nothing else."  Darkness now crept swiftly on over the landscape.  "You are rather bigmouthed," said Maskull coolly.  "But after we have heard you play, perhaps I shall adventure a tune myself."  "You?  Are you a musician, then?  Do you even know what music is?"  A flame danced in Gleameil's eyes.  "Maskull thinks music reposes in the instrument," she said in her intense way.  "But it is in the soul of the Master."  "Yes," said Earthrid, "but that is not all.  I will tell you what it is.  In Threal, where I was born and brought up, we learn the mystery of the Three in nature.  This world, which lies extended before us, has three directions.  Length is the line which shuts off what is, from what is not.  Breadth is the surface which shows us in what manner one thing of what-is, lives with another thing.  Depth is the path which leads from what-is, to our own body.  In music it is not otherwise.  Tone is existence, without which nothing at all can be. Symmetry and Numbers are the manner in which tones exist, one with another.  Emotion is the movement of our soul toward the wonderful world that is being created.  Now, men when they make music are accustomed to build beautiful tones, because of the delight they cause.  Therefore their music world is based on pleasure; its symmetry is regular and charming, its emotion is sweet and lovely.... But my music is founded on painful tones; and thus its symmetry is wild, and difficult to discover; its emotion is bitter and terrible."  "If I had not anticipated its being original, I would not have come here," said Maskull.  "Still, explain--why can't harsh tones have simple symmetry of form?  And why must they necessarily cause more profound emotions in us who listen?"  "Pleasures may harmonise.  Pains must clash; and in the order of their clashing lies the symmetry.  The emotions follow the music, which is rough and earnest."  "You may call it music," remarked Maskull thoughtfully, "but to me it bears a closer resemblance to actual life."  "If Shaping's plans had gone straight, life would have been like that other sort of music.  He who seeks can find traces of that intention in the world of nature.  But as it has turned out, real life resembles my music and mine is the true music."  "Shall we see living shapes?"  "I don't know what my mood will be," returned Earthrid.  "But when I have finished, you shall adventure your tune, and produce whatever shapes you please--unless, indeed, the tune is out of your own big body."  "The shocks you are preparing may kill us," said Gleameil, in a low, taut voice, "but we shall die, seeing beauty."  Earthrid looked at her with a dignified expression.  "Neither you, nor any other person, can endure the thoughts which I put into my music.  Still, you must have it your own way.  It needed a woman to call it 'beauty.'  But if this is beauty, what is ugliness?"  "That I can tell you, Master," replied Gleameil, smiling at him. "Ugliness is old, stale life, while yours every night issues fresh from the womb of nature."  Earthrid stared at her, without response.  "Teargeld is rising," he said at last.  "And now you shall see--though not for long."  As the words left his mouth, the full moon peeped over the hills in the dark eastern sky.  They watched it in silence, and soon it was wholly up.  It was larger than the moon of Earth, and seemed nearer. Its shadowy parts stood out in just as strong relief, but somehow it did not give Maskull the impression of being a dead world. Branchspell shone on the whole of it, but Alppain only on a part. The broad crescent that reflected Branchspell's rays alone was white and brilliant; but the part that was illuminated by both suns shone with a greenish radiance that had almost solar power, and yet was cold and cheerless.  On gazing at that combined light, he felt the same sense of disintegration that the afterglow of Alppain had always caused in him; but now the feeling was not physical, but merely aesthetic.  The moon did not appear romantic to him, but disturbing and mystical.  Earthrid rose, and stood quietly for a minute.  In the bright moonlight, his face seemed to have undergone a change.  It lost its loose, weak, disagreeable look, and acquired a sort of crafty grandeur.  He clapped his hands together meditatively two or three times, and walked up and down.  The others stood together, watching him.  Then he sat down by the side of the lake, and, leaning on his side, placed his right hand, open palm downward, on the ground, at the same time stretching out his right leg, so that the foot was in contact with the water.  While Maskull was in the act of staring at him and at the lake, he felt a stabbing sensation right through his heart, as though he had been pierced by a rapier.  He barely recovered himself from falling, and as he did so he saw that a spout had formed on the water, and was now subsiding again.  The next moment he was knocked down by a violent blow in the mouth, delivered by an invisible hand.  He picked himself up; and observed that a second spout had formed.  No sooner was he on his legs, than a hideous pain hammered away inside his brain, as if caused by a malignant tumour.  In his agony, he stumbled and fell again; this time on the arm Krag had wounded.  All his other mishaps were forgotten in this one, which half stunned him.  It lasted only a moment, and then sudden relief came, and he found that Earthrid's rough music had lost its power over him.  He saw him still stretched in the same position.  Spouts were coming thick and fast on the lake, which was full of lively motion.  But Gleameil was not on her legs.  She was lying on the ground, in a heap, without moving.  Her attitude was ugly, and he guessed she was dead.  When he reached her, he discovered that she was dead.  In what state of mind she had died, he did not know, for her face wore the vulgar Crystalman grin.  The whole tragedy had not lasted five minutes.  He went over to Earthrid and dragged him forcibly away from his playing.  "You have been as good as your word, musician," he said.  "Gleameil is dead."  Earthrid tried to collect his scattered senses.  "I warned her," he replied, sitting up.  "Did I not beg her to go away?  But she died very easily.  She did not wait for the beauty she spoke about.  She heard nothing of the passion, nor even of the rhythm.  Neither have you."  Maskull looked down at him in indignation, but said nothing.  "You should not have interrupted me," went on Earthrid.  "When I am playing, nothing else is of importance.  I might have lost the thread of my ideas.  Fortunately, I never forget.  I shall start over again."  "If music is to continue, in the presence of the dead, I play next."  The man glanced up quickly.  "That can't be."  "It must be," said Maskull decisively.  "I prefer playing to listening.  Another reason is that you will have every night, but I have only tonight."  Earthrid clenched and unclenched his fist, and began to turn pale. "With your recklessness, you are likely to kill us both.  Irontick belongs to me, and until you have learned how to play, you would only break the instrument."  "Well, then, I will break it; but I am going to try."  The musician jumped to his feet and confronted him.  "Do you intend to take it from me by violence?"  "Keep calm!  You will have the same choice that you offered us.  I shall give you time to go away somewhere."  "How will that serve me, if you spoil my lake?  You don't understand what you are doing."  "Go, or stay!" responded Maskull.  "I give you till the water gets smooth again.  After that, I begin playing."  Earthrid kept swallowing.  He glanced at the lake and back to Maskull.  "Do you swear it?"  "How long that will take, you know better than I; but till then you are safe."  Earthrid cast him a look of malice, hesitated for an instant, and then moved away, and started to climb the nearest hill.  Halfway up he glanced over his shoulder apprehensively, as if to see what was happening.  In another minute or so, he had disappeared over the crest, travelling in the direction of the shore that faced Matterplay.  Later, when the water was once more tranquil.  Maskull sat down by its edge, in imitation of Earthrid's attitude.  He knew neither how to set about producing his music, nor what would come of it.  But audacious projects entered his brain and he willed to create physical shapes--and, above all, one shape, that of Surtur.  Before putting his foot to the water, he turned things over a little in his mind.  He said, "What themes are in common music, shapes  are in this music. The composer does not find his theme by picking out single notes; but the whole theme flashes into his mind by inspiration.  So it must be with shapes.  When I start playing, if I am worth anything, the undivided ideas will pass from my unconscious mind to this lake, and then, reflected back in the dimensions of reality, I shall be for the first time made acquainted with them.  So it must be."  The instant his foot touched the water, he felt his thoughts flowing from him.  He did not know what they were, but the mere act of flowing created a sensation of joyful mastery.  With this was curiosity to learn what they would prove to be.  Spouts formed on the lake in increasing numbers, but he experienced no pain.  His thoughts, which he knew to be music, did not issue from him in a steady, unbroken stream, but in great, rough gushes, succeeding intervals of quiescence.  When these gushes came, the whole lake broke out in an eruption of spouts.  He realised that the ideas passing from him did not arise in his intellect, but had their source in the fathomless depths of his will. He could not decide what character they should have, but he was able to force them out, or retard them, by the exercise of his volition.  At first nothing changed around him.  Then the moon grew dimmer, and a strange, new radiance began to illuminate the landscape.  It increased so imperceptibly that it was some time before he recognised it as the Muspel-light which he had seen in the Wombflash Forest.  He could not give it a colour, or a name, but it filled him with a sort of stern and sacred awe.  He called up the resources of his powerful will.  The spouts thickened like a forest, and many of them were twenty feet high.  Teargeld looked faint and pale; the radiance became intense; but it cast no shadows.  The wind got up, but where Maskull was sitting, it was calm.  Shortly afterward it began to shriek and whistle, like a full gale.  He saw no shapes, and redoubled his efforts.  His ideas were now rushing out onto the lake so furiously that his whole soul was possessed by exhilaration and defiance.  But still he did not know their nature.  A huge spout shot up and at the same moment the hills began to crack and break.  Great masses of loose soil were erupted from their bowels, and in the next period of quietness, he saw that the landscape had altered.  Still the mysterious light intensified.  The moon disappeared entirely.  The noise of the unseen tempest was terrifying, but Maskull played heroically on, trying to urge out ideas which would take shape.  The hillsides were cleft with chasms.  The water escaping from the tops of the spouts, swamped the land; but where he was, it was dry.  The radiance grew terrible.  It was everywhere, but Maskull fancied that it was far brighter in one particular quarter.  He thought that it was becoming localised, preparatory to contracting into a solid form.  He strained and strained....  Immediately afterward the bottom of the lake subsided.  Its waters fell through, and his instrument was broken.  The Muspel-light vanished.  The moon shone out again, but Maskull could not see it.  After that unearthly shining, he seemed to himself to be in total blackness.  The screaming wind ceased; there was a dead silence.  His thoughts finished flowing toward the lake, and his foot no longer touched water, but hung in space.  He was too stunned by the suddenness of the change to either think or feel.  While he was still lying dazed, a vast explosion occurred in the newly opened depths beneath the lakebed.  The water in its descent had met fire.  Maskull was lifted bodily in the air, many yards high, and came down heavily.  He lost consciousness....    When he came to his senses again, he saw everything.  Teargeld was gleaming brilliantly.  He was lying by the side of the old lake, but it was now a crater, to the bottom of which his eyes could not penetrate.  The hills encircling it were torn, as if by heavy gunfire.  A few thunderclouds were floating in the air at no great height, from which branched lightning descended to the earth incessantly, accompanied by alarming and singular crashes.  He got on his legs, and tested his actions.  Finding that he was uninjured, he first of all viewed the crater at closer quarters, and then started to walk painfully toward the northern shore.  When he had attained the crest above the lake, the landscape sloped gently down for two miles to the sea.  Everywhere he passed through traces of his rough work.  The country was carved into scarps, grooves, channels, and craters.  He arrived at the line of low cliffs overlooking the beach, and found that these also were partly broken down by landslips.  He got down onto the sand and stood looking over the moonlit, agitated sea, wondering how he could contrive to escape from this island of failure.  Then he saw Earthrid's body, lying quite close to him.  It was on its back.  Both legs had been violently torn off and he could not see them anywhere.  Earthrid's teeth were buried in the flesh of his right forearm, indicating that the man had died in unreasoning physical agony.  The skin gleamed green in the moonlight, but it was stained by darker discolourations, which were wounds.  The sand about him was dyed by the pool of blood which had long since filtered through.  Maskull left the corpse in dismay, and walked a long way along the sweet-smelling shore.  Sitting down on a rock, he waited for daybreak.    Chapter 16  LEEHALLFAE  At midnight, when Teargeld was in the south, throwing his shadow straight toward the sea and making everything nearly as bright as day, he saw a great tree floating in the water, not far out.  It was thirty feet out of the water, upright, and alive, and its roots must have been enormously deep and wide.  It was drifting along the coast, through the heavy seas.  Maskull eyed it incuriously for a few minutes.  Then it dawned on him that it might be a good thing to investigate its nature.  Without stopping to weigh the danger, he immediately swam out, caught hold of the lowest branch, and swung himself up.  He looked aloft and saw that the main stem was thick to the very top, terminating in a knob that somewhat resembled a human head.  He made his way toward this knob, through the multitude of boughs, which were covered with tough, slippery, marine leaves, like seaweed.  Arriving at the crown, he found that it actually was a sort of head, for there were membranes like rudimentary eyes all the way around it, denoting some form of low intelligence.  At that moment the tree touched bottom, though some way from the shore, and began to bump heavily.  To steady himself, Maskull put his hand out, and, in doing so, accidentally covered some of the membranes.  The tree sheered off the land, as if by an act of will. When it was steady again, Maskull removed his hand; they at once drifted back to shore.  He thought a bit, and then started experimenting with the eyelike membranes.  It was as he had guessed-- these eyes were stimulated by the light of the moon, and whichever way the light came from, the tree would travel.  A rather defiant smile crossed Maskull's face as it struck him that it might be possible to navigate this huge plant-animal as far as Matterplay.  He lost no time in putting the conception into execution.  Tearing off some of the long, tough leaves, he bound up all the membranes except the ones that faced the north.  The tree instantly left the island, and definitely put out to sea.  It travelled due north.  It was not moving at more than a mile an hour, however, while Matterplay was possibly forty miles distant.  The great spout waves fell against the trunk with mighty thuds; the breaking seas hissed through the lower branches--Maskull rested high and dry, but was more than a little apprehensive about their slow rate of progress.  Presently he sighted a current racing along toward the north-west, and that put another idea into his head.  He began to juggle with the membranes again, and before long had succeeded in piloting his tree into the fast-running stream.  As soon as they were fairly in its rapids, he blinded the crown entirely, and thenceforward the current acted in the double capacity of road and steed.  Maskull made himself secure among the branches and slept for the remainder of the night.  When his eyes opened again, the island was out of sight.  Teargeld was setting in the western sea.  The sky in the east was bright with the colours of the approaching day.  The air was cool and fresh; the light over the sea was beautiful, gleaming, and mysterious.  Land-- probably Matterplay--lay ahead, a long, dark line of low cliffs, perhaps a mile away.  The current no longer ran toward the shore, but began to skirt the coast without drawing any closer to it.  As soon as Maskull realised the fact, he manoeuvred the tree out of its channel and started drifting it inshore.  The eastern sky blazed up suddenly with violent dyes, and the outer rim of Branchspell lifted itself above the sea.  The moon had already sunk.  The shore loomed nearer and nearer.  In physical character it was like Swaylone's Island--the same wide sands, small cliffs, and rounded, insignificant hills inland, without vegetation.  In the early-morning sunlight, however, it looked romantic.  Maskull, hollow-eyed and morose, cared nothing for all that, but the moment the tree grounded, clambered swiftly down through the branches and dropped into the sea.  By the time he had swam ashore, the white, stupendous sun was high above the horizon.  He walked along the sands toward the east for a considerable distance, without having any special intention in his mind.  He thought he would go on until he came to some creek or valley, and then turn up it.  The sun's rays were cheering, and began to relieve him of his oppressive night weight.  After strolling along the beach for about a mile, he was stopped by a broad stream that flowed into the sea out of a kind of natural gateway in the line of cliffs.  Its water was of a beautiful, limpid green, all filled with bubbles.  So ice-cold, aerated, and enticing did it look that he flung himself face downward on the ground and took a prolonged draught.  When he got up again his eyes started to play pranks--they became alternately blurted and clear....  It may have been pure imagination, but he fancied that Digrung was moving inside him.  He followed the bank of the stream through the gap in the cliffs, and then for the first time saw the real Matterplay.  A valley appeared, like a jewel enveloped by naked rock.  All the hill country was bare and lifeless, but this valley lying in the heart of it was extremely fertile; he had never seen such fertility.  It wound up among the hills, and all that he was looking at was its broad lower end.  The floor of the valley was about half a mile wide; the stream that ran down its middle was nearly a hundred feet across, but was exceedingly shallow--in most places not more than a few inches deep.  The sides of the valley were about seventy feet high, but very sloping; they were clothed from top to bottom with little, bright-leaved trees-- not of varied tints of one colour, like Earth trees, but of widely diverse colours, most of which were brilliant and positive.  The floor itself was like a magician's garden.  Densely interwoven trees, shrubs, and parasitical climbers fought everywhere for possession of it.  The forms were strange and grotesque, and each one seemed different; the colours of leaf, flower, sexual organs, and stem were equally peculiar--all the different combinations of the five primary colours of Tormance seemed to be represented, and the result, for Maskull was a sort of eye chaos.  So rank was the vegetation that he could not fight his way through it; he was obliged to take to the riverbed.  The contact of the water created an odd tingling sensation throughout his body, like a mild electric shock. There were no birds, but a few extraordinary-looking winged reptiles of small size kept crossing the valley from hill to hill. Swarms of flying insects clustered around him, threatening mischief, but in the end it turned out that his blood was disagreeable to them. for he was not bitten once.  Repulsive crawling creatures resembling centipedes, scorpions, snakes, and so forth were in myriads on the banks of the stream, but they also made no attempt to use their weapons on his bare legs and feet, as he passed through them into the water....  Presently however, he was confronted in midstream by a hideous monster, of the size of a pony, but resembling in shape--if it resembled anything--a sea crustacean; and then he came to a halt. They stared at one another, the beast with wicked eyes, Maskull with cool and wary ones.  While he was staring, a singular thing happened to him.  His eyes blurred again.  But when in a minute or two this blurring passed away and he saw clearly once more, his vision had changed in character.  He was looking right through the animal's body and could distinguish all its interior parts.  The outer crust, however, and all the hard tissues were misty and semi-transparent; through them a luminous network of blood-red veins and arteries stood out in startling distinctness.  The hard parts faded away to nothingness, and the blood system alone was left.  Not even the fleshy ducts remained.  The naked blood alone was visible, flowing this way and that like a fiery, liquid skeleton, in the shape of the monster. Then this blood began to change too.  Instead of a continuous liquid stream, Maskull perceived that it was composed of a million individual points.  The red colour had been an illusion caused by the rapid motion of the points; he now saw clearly that they resembled minute suns in their scintillating brightness.  They seemed like a double drift of stars, streaming through space.  One drift was travelling toward a fixed point in the centre, while the other was moving away from it.  He recognised the former as the veins of the beast, the latter as the arteries, and the fixed point as the heart.  While he was still looking, lost in amazement, the starry network went out suddenly like an extinguished flame.  Where the crustacean had stood, there was nothing.  Yet through this "nothing" he could not see the landscape.  Something was standing there that intercepted the light, though it possessed neither shape, colour, nor substance. And now the object, which could no longer be perceived by vision, began to be felt by emotion.  A delightful, springlike sense of rising sap, of quickening pulses of love, adventure, mystery, beauty, femininity--took possession of his being, and, strangely enough, he identified it with the monster.  Why that invisible brute should cause him to feel young, sexual, and audacious, he did not ask himself, for he was fully occupied with the effect.  But it was as if flesh, bones, and blood had been discarded, and he were face to face with naked Life itself, which slowly passed into his own body.  The sensations died away.  There was a brief interval, and then the streaming, starlike skeleton rose up again out of space.  It changed to the red-blood system.  The hard parts of the body reappeared, with more and more distinctness, and at the same time the network of blood grew fainter.  Presently the interior parts were entirely concealed by the crust--the creature stood opposite Maskull in its old formidable ugliness, hard, painted, and concrete.  Disliking something about him, the crustacean turned aside and stumbled awkwardly away on its six legs, with laborious and repulsive movements, toward the other bank of the stream.  Maskull's apathy left him after this adventure.  He became uneasy and thoughtful.  He imagined that he was beginning to see things through Digrung's eyes, and that there were strange troubles immediately ahead.  The next time his eyes started to blur, he fought it down with his will, and nothing happened.  The valley ascended with many windings toward the hills.  It narrowed considerably, and the wooded slopes on either side grew steeper and higher.  The stream shrunk to about twenty feet across, but it was deeper--it was alive with motion, music, and bubbles.  The electric sensations caused by its water became more pronounced, almost disagreeably so; but there was nowhere else to walk.  With its deafening confusion of sounds from the multitude of living creatures, the little valley resembled a vast conversation hall of Nature.  The life was still more prolific than before; every square foot of space was a tangle of struggling wills, both animal and vegetable.  For a naturalist it would have been paradise, for no two shapes were alike, and all were fantastic, with individual character.  It looked as if life forms were being coined so fast by Nature that there was not physical room for all.  Nevertheless it was not as on Earth, where a hundred seeds are scattered in order that one may be sown.  Here the young forms seemed to survive, while, to find accommodation for them, the old ones perished; everywhere he looked they were withering and dying, without any ostensible cause--they were simply being killed by new life.  Other creatures sported so wildly, in front of his very eyes, that they became of different "kingdoms" altogether.  For example, a fruit was lying on the ground, of the size and shape of a lemon, but with a tougher skin.  He picked it up, intending to eat the contained pulp; but inside it was a fully formed young tree, just on the point of bursting its shell.  Maskull threw it away upstream.  It floated back toward him; by the time he was even with it, its downward motion had stopped and it was swimming against the current.  He fished it out and discovered that it had sprouted six rudimentary legs.  Maskull sang no paeans of praise in honour of the gloriously overcrowded valley.  On the contrary, he felt deeply cynical and depressed.  He thought that the unseen power--whether it was called Nature, Life, Will, or God--that was so frantic to rush forward and occupy this small, vulgar, contemptible world, could not possess very high aims and was not worth much.  How this sordid struggle for an hour or two of physical existence could ever be regarded as a deeply earnest and important business was beyond his comprehension The atmosphere choked him, he longed for air and space.  Thrusting his way through to the side of the ravine, he began to climb the overhanging cliff, swinging his way up from tree to tree.  When he arrived at the top, Branchspell beat down on him with such brutal, white intensity that he saw that there was no staying there. He looked around, to ascertain what part of the country he had come to.  He had travelled about ten miles from the sea, as the crow flies.  The bare, undulating wolds sloped straight down toward it; the water glittered in the distance; and on the horizon he was just able to make out Swaylone's Island.  Looking north, the land continued sloping upward as far as he could see.  Over the crest-- that is to say, some miles away--a line of black, fantastic-shaped rocks of quite another character showed themselves; this was probably Threal.  Behind these again, against the sky, perhaps fifty or even a hundred miles off, were the peaks of Lichstorm, most of them covered with greenish snow that glittered in the sunlight.  They were stupendously high and of weird contours.  Most of them were conical to the top, but from the top, great masses of mountain balanced themselves at what looked like impossible angles-- overhanging without apparent support.  A land like that promised something new, he thought: extraordinary inhabitants.  The idea took shape in his mind to go there, and to travel as swiftly as possible, it might even be feasible to get there before sunset.  It was less the mountains themselves that attracted him than the country which lay beyond--the prospect of setting eyes on the blue sun, which he judged to be the wonder of wonders in Tormance.  The direct route was over the hills, but that was out of the question, because of the killing heat and the absence of shade.  He guessed, however, that the valley would not take him far out of his way, and decided to keep to that for the time being, much as he hated and feared it.  Into the hotbed of life, therefore, he once more swung himself.  Once down, he continued to follow the windings of the valley for several miles through sunlight and shadow.  The path became increasingly difficult.  The cliffs closed in on either side until they were less than a hundred yards apart, while the bed of the ravine was blocked by boulders, great and small, so that the little stream, which was now diminished to the proportions of a brook, had to come down where and how it could.  The forms of life grew stranger.  Pure plants and pure animals disappeared by degrees, and their place was filled by singular creatures that seemed to partake of both characters.  They had limbs, faces, will, and intelligence, but they remained for the greater part of their time rooted in the ground by preference, and they fed only on soil and air.  Maskull saw no sexual organs and failed to understand how the young came into existence.  Then he witnessed an astonishing sight.  A large and fully developed plant-animal appeared suddenly in front of him, out of empty space. He could not believe his eyes, but stared at the creature for a long time in amazement.  It went on calmly moving and burrowing before him, as thought it had been there all its life.  Giving up the puzzle, Maskull resumed his striding from rock to rock up the gorge, and then, quietly and without warning, the same phenomenon occurred again.  No longer could he doubt than he was seeing miracles--that Nature was precipitating its shapes into the world without making use of the medium of parentage....  No solution of the problem presented itself.  The brook too had altered in character.  A trembling radiance came up from its green water, like some imprisoned force escaping into the air.  He had not walked in it for some time; now he did so, to test its quality.  He felt new life entering his body, from his feet upward; it resembled a slowly moving cordial, rather than mere heat. The sensation was quite new in his experience, yet he knew by instinct what it was.  The energy emitted by the brook was ascending his body neither as friend nor foe but simply because it happened to be the direct road to its objective elsewhere.  But, although it had no hostile intentions, it was likely to prove a rough traveller--he was clearly conscious that its passage through his body threatened to bring about some physical transformation, unless he could do something to prevent it.  Leaping quickly out of the water, he leaned against a rock, tightened his muscles, and braced himself against the impending charge.  At that very moment the blurring again attacked his sight, and, while he was guarding against that, his forehead sprouted out into a galaxy of new eyes.  He put his hand up and counted six, in addition to his old ones.  The danger was past and Maskull laughed, congratulating himself on having got off so easily.  Then he wondered what the new organs were for--whether they were a good or a bad thing.  He had not taken a dozen steps up the ravine before he found out.  Just as he was in the act of jumping down from the top of a boulder, his vision altered and he came to an automatic standstill.  He was perceiving two worlds simultaneously.  With his own eyes he saw the gorge as before, with its rocks, brook, plant-animals, sunshine, and shadows.  But with his acquired eyes he saw differently.  All the details of the valley were visible, but the light seemed turned down, and everything appeared faint, hard, and uncoloured.  The sun was obscured by masses of cloud which filled the whole sky.  This vapour was in violent and almost living motion.  It was thick in extension, but thin in texture; some parts, however, were far denser than others, as the particles were crushed together or swept apart by the motion.  The green sparks from the brook, when closely watched, could be distinguished individually, each one wavering up toward the clouds, but the moment they got within them a fearful struggle seemed to begin.  The spark endeavoured to escape through to the upper air, while the clouds concentrated around it whichever way it darted, trying to create so dense a prison that further movement would be impossible.  As far as Maskull could detect, most of the sparks succeeded eventually in finding their way out after frantic efforts; but one that he was looking at was caught, and what happened was this.  A complete ring of cloud surrounded it, and, in spite of its furious leaps and flashes in all directions--as if it were a live, savage creature caught in a net--nowhere could it find an opening, but it dragged the enveloping cloud stuff with it, wherever it went. The vapours continued to thicken around it, until they resembled the black, heavy, compressed sky masses seen before a bad thunderstorm. Then the green spark, which was still visible in the interior, ceased its efforts, and remained for a time quite quiescent.  The cloud shape went on consolidating itself, and became nearly spherical; as it grew heavier and stiller, it started slowly to descend toward the valley floor.  When it was directly opposite Maskull, with its lower end only a few feet off the ground, its motion stopped altogether and there was a complete pause for at least two minutes.  Suddenly, like a stab of forked lightning, the great cloud shot together, became small, indented, and coloured, and as a plant-animal started walking around on legs and rooting up the ground in search of food.  The concluding stage of the phenomenon he witnessed with his normal eyesight.  It showed him the creature's appearing miraculously out of nowhere.  Maskull was shaken.  His cynicism dropped from him and gave place to curiosity and awe.  "That was exactly like the birth of a thought," he said to himself, "but who was the thinker?  Some great Living Mind is at work in this spot.  He has intelligence, for all his shapes are different, and he has character, for all belong to the same general type....  If I'm not wrong, and if it's the force called Shaping or Crystalman, I've seen enough to make me want to find out something more about him....  It would be ridiculous to go on to other riddles before I have solved these."  A voice called out to him from behind, and, turning around, he saw a human figure hastening toward him from some distance down the ravine. It looked more like a man than a woman.  He was rather tall, but nimble, and was clothed in a dark, frocklike garment that reached from the neck to below the knees.  Around his head was rolled a turban.  Maskull waited for him, and when he was nearer went a little way to meet him.  Then he experienced another surprise, for this person, although clearly a human being, was neither man nor woman, nor anything between the two, but was unmistakably of a third positive sex, which was remarkable to behold and difficult to understand.  In order to translate into words the sexual impression produced in Maskull's mind by the stranger's physical aspect, it is necessary to coin a new pronoun, for none in earthly use would be applicable.  Instead of "he," "she," or "it," therefore "ae" will be used.  He found himself incapable of grasping at first why the bodily peculiarities of this being should strike him as springing from sex, and not from race, and yet there was no doubt about the fact itself. Body, face, and eyes were absolutely neither male nor female, but something quite different.  Just as one can distinguish a man from a woman at the first glance by some indefinable difference of expression and atmospheres altogether apart from the contour of the figure, so the stranger was separated in appearance from both.  As with men and women, the whole person expressed a latent sensuality, which gave body and face alike their peculiar character....  Maskull decided that it was love--but what love--love for whom? it was neither the shame-carrying passion of a male, nor the deep-rooted instinct of a female to obey her destiny.  It was as real and irresistible as these, but quite different.  As he continued staring into those strange, archaic eyes, he had an intuitive feeling that aer lover was no other than Shaping himself. it came to him that the design of this love was not the continuance of the race but the immortality on earth of the individual.  No children were produced by the act; the lover aerself was the eternal child.  Further, ae sought like a man, but received like a woman. All these things were dimly and confusedly expressed by this extraordinary being, who seemed to have dropped out of another age, when creation was different.  Of all the weird personalities Maskull had so far met in Tormance, this one struck him as infinitely the most foreign--that is, the farthest removed from him in spiritual structure.  If they were to live together for a hundred years, they could never be companions.  Maskull pulled himself out of his trancelike meditations and, viewing the newcomer in greater detail, tried with his understanding to account for the marvellous things told him by his intuitions.  Ae possessed broad shoulders and big bones, and was without female breasts, and so far ae resembled a man.  But the bones were so flat and angular that aer flesh presented something of the character of a crystal, having plane surfaces in place of curves.  The body looked as if it had not been ground down by the sea of ages into smooth and rounded regularity but had sprung together in angles and facets as the result of a single, sudden idea.  The face too was broken and irregular.  With his racial prejudices, Maskull found little beauty in it, yet beauty there was, though neither of a masculine nor of a feminine type, for it had the three essentials of beauty: character, intelligence, and repose.  The skin was copper-coloured and strangely luminous, as if lighted from within.  The face was beardless, but the hair of the head was as long as a woman's, and, dressed in a single plait, fell down behind as far as the ankles.  Ae possessed only two eyes.  That part of the turban which went across the forehead protruded so far in front that it evidently concealed some organ.  Maskull found it impossible to compute aer age.  The frame appeared active, vigorous, and healthy, the skin was clear and glowing; the eyes were powerful and alert--ae might well be in early youth. Nevertheless, the longer Maskull gazed, the more an impression of unbelievable ancientness came upon him--aer real youth seemed as far away as the view observed through a reversed telescope.  At last he addressed the stranger, though it was just as if he were conversing with a dream.  "To what sex do you belong?" he asked.  The voice in which the reply came was neither manly nor womanly, but was oddly suggestive of a mystical forest horn, heard from a great distance.  "Nowadays there are men and women, but in the olden times the world was peopled by 'phaens.'  I think I am the only survivor of all those beings who were then passing through Faceny's mind."  "Faceny?"  "Who is now miscalled Shaping or Crystalman.  The superficial names invented by a race of superficial creatures."  "What's your own name?"  "Leehallfae."  "What?"  "Leehallfae.  And yours is Maskull.  I read in your mind that you have just come through some wonderful adventures.  You seem to possess extraordinary luck.  If it lasts long enough, perhaps I can make use of it."  "Do you think that my luck exists for your benefit? ... But never mind that now.  It is your sex that interests me.  How do you satisfy your desires?"  Leehallfae pointed to the concealed organ on aer brow.  "With that I gather life from the streams that flow in all the hundred Matterplay valleys.  The streams spring direct from Faceny.  My whole life has been spent trying to find Faceny himself.  I've hunted so long that if I were to state the number of years you would believe I lied."  Maskull looked at the phaen slowly.  "In Ifdawn I met someone else from Matterplay--a young man called Digrung.  I absorbed him."  "You can't be telling me this out of vanity."  "It was a fearful crime.  What will come of it?"  Leehallfae gave a curious, wrinkled smile.  "In Matterplay he will stir inside you, for he smells the air.  Already you have his eyes....  I knew him....  Take care of yourself, or something more startling may happen.  Keep out of the water."  "This seems to me a terrible valley, in which anything may happen."  "Don't torment yourself about Digrung.  The valleys belong by right to the phaens--the men here are interlopers.  It is a good work to remove them."  Maskull continued thoughtful.  "I say no more, but I see I will have to be cautious.  What did you mean about my helping you with my luck?"  "Your luck is fast weakening, but it may still be strong enough to serve me.  Together we will search for Threal."  "Search for Threal--why, is it so hard to find?"  "I have told you that my whole life has been spent in the quest."  "You said Faceny, Leehallfae."  The phaen gazed at him with queer, ancient eyes, and smiled again. "This stream, Maskull, like every other life stream in Matterplay, has its source in Faceny.  But as all these streams issue out from Threal, it is in Threal that we must look for Faceny."  "But what's to prevent your finding Threal?  Surely it's a well-known country?"  "It lies underground.  Its communications with the upper world are few, and where they are, no one that I have ever spoken to knows.  I have scoured the valleys and the hills.  I have been to the very gates of Lichstorm.  I am old, so that your aged men would appear newborn infants beside me, but I am as far from Threal as when I was a green youth, dwelling among a throng of fellow phaens."  "Then, if my luck is good, yours is very bad....  But when you have found Faceny, what do you gain?"  Leehallfae looked at him in silence.  The smile faded from aer face, and its place was taken by such a look of unearthly pain and sorrow that Maskull had no need to press his question.  Ae was consumed by the grief and yearning of a lover eternally separated from the loved one, the scents and traces of whose person were always present.  This passion stamped her features at that moment with a wild, stern, spiritual beauty, far transcending any beauty of woman or man.  But the expression vanished suddenly, and then the abrupt contrast showed Maskull the real Leehallfae.  Aer sensuality was solitary, but vulgar--it was like the heroism of a lonely nature, pursuing animal aims with untiring persistence.  He looked at the phaen askance, and drummed his fingers against his thigh.  "Well, we will go together.  We may find something, and in any case I shan't be sorry to converse with such a singular individual as yourself."  "But I should warn you, Maskull.  You and I are of different creations.  A phaen's body contains the whole of life, a man's body contains only the half of life--the other half is in woman.  Faceny may be too strong a draught for your body to endure....  Do you not feel this?"  "I am dull with my different feelings.  I must take what precautions I can, and chance the rest."  He bent down, and, taking hold of the phaen's thin and ragged robe, tore off a broad strip, which he proceeded to swathe in folds around his forehead.  "I'm not forgetting your advice, Leehallfae.  I would not like to start the walk as Maskull and finish it as Digrung."  The phaen gave a twisted grin, and they began to move upstream.  The road was difficult.  They had to stride from boulder to boulder, and found it warm work.  Occasionally a worse obstacle presented itself, which they could surmount only by climbing.  There was no more conversation for a long time.  Maskull, as far as possible, adopted his companion's counsel to avoid the water, but here and there he was forced to set foot in it.  The second or third time he did so, he felt a sudden agony in his arm, where it had been wounded by Krag. His eyes grew joyful; his fears vanished; and he began deliberately to tread the stream.  Leehallfae stroked aer chin and watched him with screwed-up eyes, trying to comprehend what had happened.  "Is your luck speaking to you, Maskull, or what is the matter?"  "Listen.  You are a being of antique experience, and ought to know, if anyone does.  What is Muspel?"  The phaen's face was blank.  "I don't know the name."  "It is another world of some sort."  "That cannot be.  There is only this one world--Faceny's."  Maskull came up to aer, linked arms, and began to talk.  "I'm glad I fell in with you, Leehallfae, for this valley and everything connected with it need a lot of explaining.  For example, in this spot there are hardly any organic forms left--why have they all disappeared?  You call this brook a 'life stream,' yet the nearer its source we get, the less life it produces.  A mile or two lower down we had those spontaneous plant-animals appearing out of nowhere, while right down by the sea, plants and animals were tumbling over one another.  Now, if all this is connected in some mysterious way or other with your Faceny, it seems to me he must have a most paradoxical nature.  His essence doesn't start creating shapes until it has become thoroughly weakened and watered....  But perhaps both of us are talking nonsense."  Leehallfae shook aer head.  "Everything hangs together.  The stream is life, and it is throwing off sparks of life all the time.  When these sparks are caught and imprisoned by matter, they become living shapes.  The nearer the stream is to its source, the more terrible and vigorous is its life.  You'll see for yourself when we reach the head of the valley that there are no living shapes there at all. That means that there is no kind of matter tough enough to capture and hold the terrible sparks that are to be found there.  Lower down the stream, most of the sparks are vigorous enough to escape to the upper air, but some are held when they are a little way up, and these burst suddenly into shapes.  I myself am of this nature.  Lower down still, toward the sea, the stream has lost a great part of its vital power and the sparks are lazy and sluggish.  They spread out, rather than rise into the air.  There is hardly any kind of matter, however delicate, that is incapable of capturing these feeble sparks, and they are captured in multitudes--that accounts for the innumerable living shapes you see there.  But not only that--the sparks are passed from one body to another by way of generation, and can never hope to cease being so until they are worn out by decay. Lowest of all, you have the Sinking Sea itself.  There the degenerate and enfeebled life of the Matterplay streams has for its body the whole sea.  So weak is it's power that it can't succeed in creating any shapes at all but you can see its ceaseless, futile attempts to do so, in those spouts."  "So the slow development of men and women is due to the feebleness of the life germ in their case?"  "Exactly.  It can't attain all its desires at once.  And now you can see how immeasurably superior are the phaens, who spring spontaneously from the more electric and vigorous sparks."  "But where does the matter come from that imprisons these sparks?"  "When life dies, it becomes matter.  Matter itself dies, but its place is constantly taken by new matter."  "But if life comes from Faceny, how can it die at all?"  "Life is the thoughts of Faceny, and once these thoughts have left his brain they are nothing--mere dying embers."  "This is a cheerless philosophy," said Maskull.  "But who is Faceny himself, then, and why does he think at all?"  Leehallfae gave another wrinkled smile.  "That I'll explain too. Faceny is of this nature.  He faces Nothingness in all directions. He has no back and no sides, but is all face; and this face is his shape.  It must necessarily be so, for nothing else can exist between him and Nothingness.  His face is all eyes, for he eternally contemplates Nothingness.  He draws his inspirations from it; in no other way could he feel himself.  For the same reason, phaens and even men love to be in empty places and vast solitudes, for each one is a little Faceny."  "That rings true," said Maskull.  "Thoughts flow perpetually from Faceny's face backward.  Since his face is on all sides, however, they flow into his interior.  A draught of thought thus continuously flows from Nothingness to the inside of Faceny, which is the world.  The thoughts become shapes, and people the world.  This outer world, therefore, which is lying all around us, is not outside at all, as it happens, but inside.  The visible universe is like a gigantic stomach, and the real outside of the world we shall never see."  Maskull pondered deeply for a while.  "Leehallfae, I fail to see what you personally have to hope for, since you are nothing more than a discarded, dying thought."  "Have you never loved a woman?" asked the phaen, regarding him fixedly.  "Perhaps I have."  "When you loved, did you have no high moments?"  "That's asking the same question in other words."  "In those moments you were approaching Faceny.  If you could have drawn nearer still, would you not have done so?"  "I would, regardless of the consequences."  "Even if you personally had nothing to hope for?"  "But I would have that to hope for."  Leehallfae walked on in silence.  "A man is the half of Life," ae broke out suddenly.  "A woman is the other half of life, but a phaen is the whole of life.  Moreover, when life becomes split into halves, something else has dropped out of it-- something that belongs only to the whole.  Between your love and mine there is no comparison.  If even your sluggish blood is drawn to Faceny, without stopping to ask what will come of it, how do you suppose it is with me?"  "I don't question the genuineness of your passion," replied Maskull, "but it's a pity you can't see your way to carry it forward into the next world."  Leehallfae gave a distorted grin, expressing heaven knows what emotion.  "Men think what they like, but phaens are so made that they can see the world only as it really is."  That ended the conversation.  The sun was high in the sky, and they appeared to be approaching the head of the ravine.  Its walls had still further closed in and, except at those moments when Branchspell was directly behind them, they strode along all the time in deep shade; but still it was disagreeably hot and relaxing.  All life had ceased.  A beautiful, fantastic spectacle was presented by the cliff faces, the rocky ground, and the boulders that choked the entire width of the gorge. They were a snow-white crystalline limestone, heavily scored by veins of bright, gleaming blue.  The rivulet was no longer green, but a clear, transparent crystal.  Its noise was musical, and altogether it looked most romantic and charming, but Leehallfae seemed to find something else in it--aer features grew more and more set and tortured.  About half an hour after all the other life forms had vanished, another plant-animal was precipitated out of space, in front of their eyes.  It was as tall as Maskull himself, and had a brilliant and vigorous appearance, as befitted a creature just out of Nature's mint.  It started to walk about; but hardly had it done so when it burst silently asunder.  Nothing remained of it--the whole body disappeared instantaneously into the same invisible mist from which it had sprung.  "That bears out what you said," commented Maskull, turning rather pale.  "Yes," answered Leehallfae, "we have now come to the region of terrible life."  "Then, since you're right in this, I must believe all that you've been telling me."  As he uttered the words, they were just turning a bend of the ravine. There now loomed up straight ahead a perpendicular cliff about three hundred feet in height, composed of white, marbled rock.  It was the head of the valley, and beyond it they could not proceed.  "In return for my wisdom," said the phaen, "you will now lend me your luck."  They walked up to the base of the cliff, and Maskull looked at it reflectively.  It was possible to climb it, but the ascent would be difficult.  The now tiny brook issued from a hole in the rock only a few feet up.  Apart from its musical running, not a sound was to be beard.  The floor of the gorge was in shadow, but about halfway up the precipice the sun was shining.  "What do you want me to do?" demanded Maskull.  "Everything is now in your hands, and I have no suggestions to make.  Now it's your luck that must help us."  Maskull continued gazing up a little while longer.  "We had better wait till the afternoon, Leehallfae.  I'll probably have to climb to the top, but it's too hot at present--and besides, I'm tired.  I'll snatch a few hours' sleep.  After that, we'll see."  Leehallfae seemed annoyed, but raised no opposition.    Chapter 17  CORPANG  Maskull did not awaken till long after Blodsombre.  Leehallfae was standing by his side, looking down at him.  It was doubtful whether ae had slept at all.  "What time is it?" Maskull asked, rubbing his eyes and sitting up.  "The day is passing," was the vague reply.  Maskull got on to his feet, and gazed up at the cliff.  "Now I'm going to climb that.  No need for both of us to risk our necks, so you wait here, and if I find anything on top I'll call you."  Ale phaen glanced at him strangely.  "There's nothing up there except a bare hillside.  I've been there often.  Have you anything special in mind?"  "Heights often bring me inspiration.  Sit down, and wait."  Refreshed by his sleep, Maskull immediately attacked the face of the cliff, and took the first twenty feet at a single rush.  Then it grew precipitous, and the ascent demanded greater circumspection and intelligence.  There were few hand-  or footholds: he had to reflect before every step.  On the other hand, it was sound rock, and he was no novice at the sport.  Branchspell glared full on the wall, so that it half blinded him with its glittering whiteness.  After many doubts and pauses he drew near the top.  He was hot, sweating copiously, and rather dizzy.  To reach a ledge he caught hold of two projecting rocks, one with each hand, at the same time scrambling upward, his legs between the rocks.  The left-hand rock, which was the larger of the two, became dislodged by his weight, and, flying like a huge, dark shadow past his head, crashed down with a terrifying sound to the foot of the precipice, followed by an avalanche of smaller stones.  Maskull steadied himself as well as he could, but it was some moments before he dared to look down behind him.  At first he could not distinguish Leehallfae.  Then he caught sight of legs and hindquarters a few feet up the cliff from the bottom.  He perceived that the phaen had aer head in a cavity and was scrutinising something, and waited for aer to reappear.  Ae emerged, looked up to Maskull, and called out in aer hornlike voice, "The entrance is here!"  "I'm coming down!" roared Maskull.  "Wait for me!"  He descended swiftly--without taking too much care, for he thought he recognised his "luck" in this discovery--and within twenty minutes was standing beside the phaen.  "What happened?"  "The rock you dislodged struck this other rock just above the spring. It tore it out of its bed.  See--now there's room for us to get in!"  "Don't get excited!" said Maskull.  "It's a remarkable accident, but we have plenty of time.  Let me look."  He peered into the hole, which was large enough to admit a big man without stooping.  Contrasted with the daylight outside it was dark, yet a peculiar glow pervaded the place, and he could see well enough. A rock tunnel went straight forward into the bowels of the hill, out of sight.  The valley brook did not flow along the floor of this tunnel, as he had expected, but came up as a spring just inside the entrance.  "Well Leehallfae, not much need to deliberate, eh?  Still, observe that your stream parts company with us here."  As he turned around for an answer he noticed that his companion was trembling from head to foot.  "Why, what's the matter?"  Leehallfae pressed a hand to aer heart.  "The stream leaves us, but what makes the stream what it is continues with us.  Faceny is there."  "But surely you don't expect to see him in person?  Why are you shaking?"  "Perhaps it will be too much for me after all."  "Why?  How is it affecting you?"  The phaen took him by the shoulder and held him at arm's length, endeavouring to study him with aer unsteady eyes.  "Faceny's thoughts are obscure.  I am his lover, you are a lover of women, yet he grants to you what he denies to me."  "What does he grant to me?"  "To see him, and go on living.  I shall die.  But it's immaterial. Tomorrow both of us will be dead."  Maskull impatiently shook himself free.  "Your sensations may be reliable in your own case, but how do you know I shall die?"  "Life is flaming up inside you," replied Leehallfae, shaking aer head.  "But after it has reached its climax--perhaps tonight--it will sink rapidly and you'll die tomorrow.  As for me, if I enter Threal I shan't come out again.  A smell of death is being wafted to me out of this hole."  "You talk like a frightened man.  I smell nothing."  "I am not frightened," said Leehallfae quietly--ae had been gradually recovering aer tranquillity--"but when one has lived as long as I have, it is a serious matter to die.  Every year one puts out new roots."  "Decide what you're going to do," said Maskull with a touch of contempt, "for I'm going in at once."  The phaen gave an odd, meditative stare down the ravine, and after that walked into the cavern without another word.  Maskull, scratching his head, followed close at aer heels.  The moment they stepped across the bubbling spring, the atmosphere altered.  Without becoming stale or unpleasant, it grew cold, clear and refined, and somehow suggested austere and tomblike thoughts. The daylight disappeared at the first bend in the tunnel.  After that, Maskull could not say where the light came from.  The air itself must have been luminous, for though it was as light as full moon on Earth, neither he nor Leehallfae cast a shadow.  Another peculiarity of the light was that both the walls of the tunnel and their own bodies appeared colourless.  Everything was black and white, like a lunar landscape.  This intensified the solemn, funereal feelings created by the atmosphere.  After they had proceeded for about ten minutes, the tunnel began to widen out.  The roof was high above their heads, and six men could have walked side by side.  Leehallfae was visibly weakening.  Ae dragged aerself along slowly and painfully, with sunken head.  Maskull caught hold of aer.  "You can't go on like that.  Better let me take you back."  The phaen smiled, and staggered.  "I'm dying."  "Don't talk like that.  It's only a passing indisposition.  Let me take you back to the daylight."  "No, help me forward.  I wish to see Faceny."  "The sick must have their way," said Maskull.  Lifting aer bodily in his arms, he walked quickly along for another hundred yards or so. They then emerged from the tunnel and faced a world the parallel of which he had never set eyes upon before.  "Set me down!" directed Leehallfae feebly.  "Here I'll die."  Maskull obeyed, and laid aer down at full length on the rocky ground. The phaen raised aerself with difficulty on one arm, and stared with fast-glazing eyes at the mystic landscape.  Maskull looked too, and what he saw was a vast, undulating plain, lighted as if by the moon--but there was of course no moon, and there were no shadows.  He made out running streams in the distance. Beside them were trees of a peculiar kind; they were rooted in the ground, but the branches also were aerial roots, and there were no leaves.  No other plants could be seen.  The soil was soft, porous rock, resembling pumice.  Beyond a mile or two in any direction the light merged into obscurity.  At their back a great rocky wall extended on either hand; but it was not square like a wall, but full of bays and promontories like an indented line of sea cliffs.  The roof of this huge underworld was out of sight.  Here and there a mighty shaft of naked rock, fantastically weathered, towered aloft into the gloom, doubtless serving to support the roof.  There were no colours--every detail of the landscape was black, white, or grey. The scene appeared so still, so solemn and religious, that all his feelings quieted down to absolute tranquillity.  Leehallfae fell back suddenly.  Maskull dropped on his knees, and helplessly watched the last flickerings of aer spirit, going out like a candle in foul air.  Death came....  He closed the eyes.  The awful grin of Crystalman immediately fastened upon the phaen's dead features.  While Maskull was still kneeling, he became conscious of someone standing beside him.  He looked up quickly and saw a man, but did not at once rise.  "Another phaen dead," said the newcomer in a grave, toneless, and intellectual voice.  Maskull got up.  The man was short and thickset but emaciated.  His forehead was not disfigured by any organs.  He was middle-aged.  The features were energetic and rather coarse--yet it seemed to Maskull as though a pure, hard life had done something toward refining them.  His sanguine eyes carried a twisted, puzzled look; some unanswerable problem was apparently in the forefront of his brain.  His face was hairless; the hair of his head was short and manly; his brow was wide.  He was clothed in a black, sleeveless robe, and bore a long staff in his hand.  There was an air of cleanness and austerity about the whole man that was attractive.  He went on speaking dispassionately to Maskull, and, while doing so, kept passing his hand reflectively over his cheeks and chin.  "They all find their way here to die.  They come from Matterplay.  There they live to an incredible age.  Partly on that account, and partly because of their spontaneous origin, they regard themselves as the favoured children of Faceny.  But when they come here to find him, they die at once."  "I think this one is the last of the race.  But whom do I speak to?"  "I am Corpang.  Who are you, where do you come from, and what are you doing here?"  "My name is Maskull.  My home is on the other side of the universe. As for what I am doing here--I accompanied Leehallfae, that phaen, from Matterplay."  "But a man doesn't accompany a phaen out of friendship.  What do you want in Threal?"  "Then this is Threal?"  "Yes."  Maskull remained silent.  Corpang studied his face with rough, curious eyes.  "Are you ignorant, or merely reticent, Maskull?"  "I came here to ask questions, and not to answer them."  The stillness of the place was almost oppressive.  Not a breeze stirred, and not a sound came through the air.  Their voices had been lowered, as though they were in a cathedral.  "Then do you want my society, or not?" asked Corpang.  "Yes, if you can fit in with my mood, which is--not to talk about myself."  "But you must at least tell me where you want to go to."  "I want to see what is to be seen here, and then go on to Lichstorm."  "I can guide you through, if that's all you want.  Come, let us start."  "First let's do our duty and bury the dead, if possible."  "Turn around," directed Corpang.  Maskull looked around quickly.  Leehallfae's body had disappeared.  "What does this mean--what has happened?"  "The body has returned to whence it came.  There was nowhere here for it to be, so it has vanished.  No burial will be required."  "Was the phaen an illusion, then?"  "In no sense."  "Well, explain quickly, then, what has taken place.  I seem to be going mad."  "There's nothing unintelligible in it, if you'll only listen calmly. The phaen belonged, body and soul, to the outside, visible world--to Faceny.  This underworld is not Faceny's world, but Thire's, and Faceny's creatures cannot breathe its atmosphere.  As this applies not only to whole bodies, but even to the last particles of bodies, the phaen has dissolved into Nothingness."  "But don't you and I belong to the outside world too?"  "We belong to all three worlds."  "What three worlds--what do you mean?"  "There are three worlds," said Corpang composedly.  "The first is Faceny's, the second is Amfuse's, the third is Thire's.  From him Threal gets it name."  "But this is mere nomenclature.  In what sense are there three worlds?"  Corpang passed his hand over his forehead.  "All this we can discuss as we go along.  It's a torment to me to be standing still."  Maskull stared again at the spot where Leehallfae's body had lain, quite bewildered at the extraordinary disappearance.  He could scarcely tear himself away from the place, so mysterious was it.  Not until Corpang called to him a second time did he make up his mind to follow him.  They set off from the rock wall straight across the airlit plain, directing their course toward the nearest trees.  The subdued light, the absence of shadows, the massive shafts, springing grey-white out of the jetlike ground, the fantastic trees, the absence of a sky, the deathly silence, the knowledge that he was underground--the combination of all these things predisposed Maskull's mind to mysticism, and he prepared himself with some anxiety to hear Corpang's explanation of the land and its wonders.  He already began to grasp that the reality of the outside world and the reality of this world were two quite different things.  "In what sense are there three worlds?" he demanded, repeating his former question.  Corpang smote the end of his staff on the ground.  "First of all, Maskull, what is your motive for asking?  If it's mere intellectual curiosity, tell me, for we mustn't play with awful matters."  "No, it isn't that," said Maskull slowly.  "I'm not a student.  My journey is no holiday tour."  "Isn't there blood on your soul?" asked Corpang, eying him intently.  The blood rose steadily to Maskull's face, but in that light it caused it to appear black.  "Unfortunately there is, and not a little."  The other's face was all wrinkles, but he made no comment.  "And so you see," went on Maskull, with a short laugh, "I'm in the very best condition for receiving your instruction."  Corpang still paused.  "Underneath your crimes I see a man," he said, after a few minutes.  "On that account, and because we are commanded to help one another, I won't leave you at present, though I little thought to be walking with a murderer....  Now to your question.... Whatever a man sees with his eyes, Maskull, he sees in three ways-- length, breadth, depth.  Length is existence, breadth is relation, depth is feeling."  "Something of the sort was told me by Earthrid, the musician, who came from Threal."  "I don't know him.  What else did he tell you?"  "He went on to apply it to music.  Continue, and pardon the interruption."  "These three states of perception are the three worlds.  Existence is Faceny's world, relation is Amfuse's world, feeling is Thire's world."  "Can't we come down to hard facts?" said Maskull, frowning.  "I understand no more than I did before what you mean by three worlds."  "There are no harder facts than the ones I am giving you.  The first world is visible, tangible Nature.  It was created by Faceny out of nothingness, and therefore we call it Existence."  "That I understand."  "The second world is Love--by which I don't mean lust.  Without love, every individual would be entirely self-centred and unable deliberately to act on others.  Without love, there would be no sympathy--not even hatred, anger, or revenge would be possible. These are all imperfect and distorted forms of pure love. Interpenetrating Faceny's world of Nature, therefore, we have Amfuse's world of Love, or Relation."  "What grounds have you for assuming that this so-called second world is not contained in the first?"  "They are contradictory.  A natural man lives for himself; a lover lives for others."  "It may be so.  It's rather mystical.  But go on--who is Thire?"  "Length and breadth together without depth give flatness.  Life and love without feeling produce shallow, superficial natures.  Feeling is the need of men to stretch out toward their creator."  "You mean prayer and worship?"  "I mean intimacy with Thire.  This feeling is not to be found in either the first or second world, therefore it is a third world. Just as depth is the line between object and subject, feeling is the line between Thire and man."  "But what is Thire himself?"  "Thire is the afterworld."  "I still don't understand," said Maskull.  "Do you believe in three separate gods, or are these merely three ways of regarding one God?"  "There are three gods, for they are mutually antagonistic.  Yet they are somehow united."  Maskull reflected a while.  "How have you arrived at these conclusions?"  "None other are possible in Threal, Maskull."  "Why in Threal--what is there peculiar here?"  "I will show you presently."  They walked on for above a mile in silence, while Maskull digested what had been said.  When they came to the first trees, which grew along the banks of a small stream of transparent water, Corpang halted.  "That bandage around your forehead has long been unnecessary," he remarked.  Maskull removed it.  He found that the line of his brow was smooth and uninterrupted, as it had never yet been since his arrival in Tormance.  "How has this come about--and how did you know it?"  "They were Faceny's organs.  They have vanished, just as the phaen's body vanished."  Maskull kept rubbing his forehead.  "I feel more human without them. But why isn't the rest of my body affected?"  "Because its living will contains the element of Thire."  "Why are we stopping here?"  Corpang broke off the tip of one of the aerial roots of a tree, and proffered it to him.  "Eat this, Maskull."  "For food, or something else?"  "Food for body and soul."  Maskull bit into the root.  It was white and hard; its white sap was bleeding.  It had no taste, but after eating it, he experienced a change of perception.  The landscape, without alteration of light or outline, became several degrees more stern and sacred.  When he looked at Corpang he was impressed by his aspect of Gothic awfulness, but the perplexed expression was still in his eyes.  "Do you spend all your time here, Corpang?"  "Occasionally I go above, but not often."  "What fastens you to this gloomy world?"  "The search for Thire."  "Then it's still a search?"  "Let us walk on."  As they resumed their journey across the dim, gradually rising plain, the conversation became even more earnest in character than before. "Although I was not born here," proceeded Corpang, "I've lived here for twenty-five years, and during all that time I have been drawing nearer to Thire, as I hope.  But there is this peculiarity about it-- the first stages are richer in fruit and more promising than the later ones.  The longer a man seeks Thire, the more he seems to absent himself.  In the beginning he is felt and known, sometimes as a shape, sometimes as a voice, sometimes an overpowering emotion. Later on all is dry, dark, and harsh in the soul.  Then you would think that Thire was a million miles off."  "How do you explain that?"  "When everything is darkest, he may be nearest, Maskull."  "But this is troubling you?"  "My days are spent in torture."  "You still persist, though?  This day darkness can't be the ultimate state?"  "My questions will be answered."  A silence ensued.  "What do you propose to show me?" asked Maskull.  "The land is about to grow wilder.  I am taking you to the Three Figures, which were carved and erected by an earlier race of men. There, we will pray."  "And what then?"  "If you are truehearted, you will see things you will not easily forget."  They had been walking slightly uphill in a sort of trough between two parallel, gently sloping downs.  The trough now deepened, while the hills on either side grew steeper.  They were in an ascending valley and, as it curved this way and that, the landscape was shut off from view.  They came to a little spring, bubbling up from the ground.  It formed a trickling brook, which was unlike all other brooks in that it was flowing up the valley instead of down.  Before long it was joined by other miniature rivulets, so that in the end it became a fair-sized stream.  Maskull kept looking at it, and puckering his forehead.  "Nature has other laws here, it seems?"  "Nothing can exist here that is not a compound of the three worlds."  "Yet the water is flowing somewhere."  "I can't explain it, but there are three wills in it."  "Is there no such thing as pure Thire-matter?"  "Thire cannot exist without Amfuse, and Amfuse cannot exist without Faceny."  Maskull thought this over for some minutes.  "That must be so," he said at last.  "Without life there can be no love, and without love there can be no religious feeling."  In the half light of the land, the tops of the hills containing the valley presently attained such a height that they could not be seen. The sides were steep and craggy, while the bed of the valley grew narrower at every step.  Not a living organism was visible.  All was unnatural and sepulchral.  Maskull said, "I feel as if I were dead, and walking in another world."  "I still do not know what you are doing here," answered Corpang.  "Why should I go on making a mystery of it?  I came to find Surtur."  "That name I've heard--but under what circumstances?"  "You forget?"  Corpang walked along, his eyes fixed on the ground, obviously troubled.  "Who is Surtur?"  Maskull shook his head, and said nothing.  The valley shortly afterward narrowed, so that the two men, touching fingertips in the middle, could have placed their free hands on the rock walls on either side.  It threatened to terminate in a cul-de- sac, but just when the road seemed least promising, and they were shut in by cliffs on all sides, a hitherto unperceived bend brought them suddenly into the open.  They emerged through a mere crack in the line of precipices.  A sort of huge natural corridor was running along at right angles to the way they had come; both ends faded into obscurity after a few hundred yards.  Right down the centre of this corridor ran a chasm with perpendicular sides; its width varied from thirty to a hundred feet, but its bottom could not be seen.  On both sides of the chasm, facing one another, were platforms of rock, twenty feet or so in width; they too proceeded in both directions out of sight.  Maskull and Corpang emerged onto one of these platforms.  The shelf opposite was a few feet higher than that on which they stood.  The platforms were backed by a double line of lofty and unclimbable cliffs, whose tops were invisible.  The stream, which had accompanied them through the gap, went straight forward, but, instead of descending the wall of the chasm as a waterfall, it crossed from side to side like a liquid bridge.  It then disappeared through a cleft in the cliffs on the opposite side.  To Maskull's mind, however, even more wonderful than this unnatural phenomenon was the absence of shadows, which was more noticeable here than on the open plain.  It made the place look like a hall of phantoms.  Corpang, without delay, led the way along the shelf to the left. When they had walked about a mile, the gulf widened to two hundred feet.  Three large rocks loomed up on the ledge opposite; they resembled three upright giants, standing motionless side by side on the extreme edge of the chasm.  Corpang and Maskull drew nearer, and then Maskull saw that they were statues.  Each was about thirty feet high, and the workmanship was of the rudest.  They represented naked men, but the limbs and trunks had been barely chipped into shape-- the faces alone had had care bestowed on them, and even these faces were merely generalised.  It was obviously the work of primitive artists.  The statues stood erect with knees closed and arms hanging straight down their sides.  All three were exactly alike.  As soon as they were directly opposite, Corpang halted.  "Is this a representation of your three Beings?" asked Maskull, awed by the spectacle in spite of his constitutional audacity.  "Ask no questions, but kneel," replied Corpang.  He dropped onto his own knees, but Maskull remained standing.  Corpang covered his eyes with one hand, and prayed silently.  After a few minutes the light sensibly faded.  Then Maskull knelt as well, but he continued looking.  It grew darker and darker, until all was like the blackest night. Sight and sound no longer existed; he was alone with his own spirit.  Then one of the three Colossi came slowly into sight again.  But it had ceased to be a statue--it was a living person.  Out of the blackness of space a gigantic head and chest emerged, illuminated by a mystic, rosy glow, like a mountain peak bathed by the rising sun. As the light grew stronger Maskull saw that the flesh was translucent and that the glow came from within.  The limbs of the apparition were wreathed in mist.  Before long the features of the face stood out distinctly.  It was that of a beardless youth of twenty years.  It possessed the beauty of a girl and the daring force of a man; it bore a mocking, cryptic smile.  Maskull felt the fresh, mysterious thrill of mingled pain and rapture of one who awakes from a deep sleep in midwinter and sees the gleaming, dark, delicate colours of the half-dawn.  The vision smiled, kept still, and looked beyond him.  He began to shudder, with delight--and many emotions.  As he gazed, his poetic sensibility acquired such a nervous and indefinable character that he could endure it no more; he burst into tears.  When he looked up again the image had nearly disappeared, and in a few moments more he was plunged back into total darkness.  Shortly afterward a second statue reappeared.  It too was transfigured into a living form, but Maskull was unable to see the details of its face and body, because of the brightness of the light that radiated from them.  This light, which started as pale gold, ended as flaming golden fire.  It illumined the whole underground landscape.  The rock ledges, the cliffs, himself and Corpang on their knees, the two unlighted statues--all appeared as if in sunlight, and the shadows were black and strongly defined.  The light carried heat with it, but a singular heat.  Maskull was unaware of any rise in temperature, but he felt his heart melting to womanish softness. His male arrogance and egotism faded imperceptibly away; his personality seemed to disappear.  What was left behind was not freedom of spirit or lightheartedness, but a passionate and nearly savage mental state of pity and distress.  He felt a tormenting desire to serve.  All this came from the heat of the statue, and was without an object.  He glanced anxiously around him, and fastened his eyes on Corpang.  He put a hand on his shoulder and aroused him from his praying.  "You must know what I am feeling, Corpang."  Corpang smiled sweetly, but said nothing.  "I care nothing for my own affairs any more.  How can I help you?"  "So much the better for you, Maskull, if you respond so quickly to the invisible worlds."  As soon as he had spoken, the figure began to vanish, and the light to die away from the landscape.  Maskull's emotion slowly subsided, but it was not until he was once more in complete darkness that he became master of himself again.  Then he felt ashamed of his boyish exhibition of enthusiasm, and thought ruefully that there must be something wanting in his character.  He got up onto his feet.  The very moment that he arose, a man's voice sounded, not a yard from his ear.  It was hardly raised above a whisper, but he could distinguish that it was not Corpang's.  As he listened he was unable to prevent himself from physically trembling.  "Maskull, you are to die," said the unseen speaker.  "Who is speaking?"  "You have only a few hours of life left.  Don't trifle the time away."  Maskull could bring nothing out.  "You have despised life," went on the low-toned voice.  "Do you really imagine that this mighty world has no meaning, and that life is a joke?"  "What must I do?"  "Repent your murders, commit no fresh ones, pay honour to..."  The voice died away.  Maskull waited in silence for it to speak again.  All remained still, however, and the speaker appeared to have taken his departure.  Supernatural horror seized him; he fell into a sort of catalepsy.  At that moment he saw one of the statues fading away, from a pale, white glow to darkness.  He had not previously seen it shining.  In a few more minutes the normal light of the land returned.  Corpang got up, and shook him out of his trance.  Maskull looked around, but saw no third person.  "Whose statue was the last?" he demanded.  "Did you hear me speaking?"  "I heard your voice, but no one else's."  "I've just had my death foretold, so I suppose I have not long to live.  Leehallfae prophesied the same thing."  Corpang shook his head.  "What value do you set on life?" he asked.  "Very little.  But it's a fearful thing all the same."  "Your death is?"  "No, but this warning."  They stopped talking.  A profound silence reigned.  Neither of the two men seemed to know what to do next, or where to go.  Then both of them heard the sound of drumming.  It was slow, emphatic, and impressive, a long way off and not loud, but against the background of quietness, very marked.  It appeared to come from some point out of sight, to the left of where they were standing, but on the same rock shelf.  Maskull's heart beat quickly.  "What can that sound be?" asked Corpang, peering into the obscurity.  "It is Surtur."  "Once again, who is Surtur?"  Maskull clutched his arm and pressed him to silence.  A strange radiance was in the air, in the direction of the drumming.  It increased in intensity and gradually occupied the whole scene. Things were no longer seen by Thire's light, but by this new light. It cast no shadows.  Corpang's nostrils swelled, and he held himself more proudly.  "What fire is that?"  "It is Muspel-light."  They both glanced instinctively at the three statues.  In the strange glow they had undergone a change.  The face of each figure was clothed in the sordid and horrible Crystalman mask.  Corpang cried out and put his hand over his eyes.  "What can this mean?" he asked a minute later.  "It must mean that life is wrong, and the creator of life too, whether he is one person or three."  Corpang looked again, like a man trying to accustom himself to a shocking sight.  "Dare we believe this?"  "You must," replied Maskull.  "You have always served the highest, and you must continue to do so.  It has simply turned out that Thire is not the highest."  Corpang's face became swollen with a kind of coarse anger.  "Life is clearly false--I have been seeking Thire for a lifetime, and now I find--this."  "You have nothing to reproach yourself with.  Crystalman has had eternity to practice his cunning in, so it's no wonder if a man can't see straight, even with the best intentions.  What have you decided to do?"  "The drumming seems to be moving away.  Will you follow it, Maskull?"  "Yes."  "But where will it take us?"  "Perhaps out of Threal altogether."  "It sounds to me more real than reality," said Corpang.  "Tell me, who is Surtur?"  "Surtur's world, or Muspel, we are told, is the original of which this world is a distorted copy.  Crystalman is life, but Surtur is other than life."  "How do you know this?"  "It has sprung together somehow--from inspiration, from experience, from conversation with the wise men of your planet.  Every hour it grows truer for me and takes a more definite shape."  Corpang stood up squarely, facing the three Figures with a harsh, energetic countenance, stamped all over with resolution.  "I believe you, Maskull.  No better proof is required than that.  Thire is not the highest; he is even in a certain sense the lowest.  Nothing but the thoroughly false and base could stoop to such deceits....  I am coming with you--but don't play the traitor.  These signs may be for you, and not for me at all, and if you leave me--"  "I make no promises.  I don't ask you to come with me.  If you prefer to stay in your little world, or if you have any doubts about it, you had better not come."  "Don't talk like that.  I shall never forget your service to me... Let us make haste, or we shall lose the sound."  Corpang started off more eagerly than Maskull.  They walked fast in the direction of the drumming.  For upward of two miles the path went along the ledge without any change of level.  The mysterious radiance gradually departed, and was replaced by the normal light of Threal. The rhythmical beats continued, but a very long way ahead--neither was able to diminish the distance.  "What kind of man are you?" Corpang suddenly broke out.  "In what respect?"  "How do you come to be on such terms with the Invisible?  How is it that I've never had this experience before I met you, in spite of my never-ending prayers and mortifications?  In what way are you superior to me?"  "To hear voices perhaps can't be made a profession," replied Maskull. "I have a simple and unoccupied mind--that may be why I sometimes hear things that up to the present you have not been able to."  Corpang darkened, and kept silent; and then Maskull saw through to his pride.  The ledge presently began to rise.  They were high above the platform on the opposite side of the gulf.  The road then curved sharply to the right, and they passed over the abyss and the other ledge as by a bridge, coming out upon the top of the opposite cliffs.  A new line of precipices immediately confronted them.  They followed the drumming along the base of these heights, but as they were passing the mouth of a large cave the sound came from its recesses, and they turned their steps inward.  "This leads to the outer world," remarked Corpang.  "I've occasionally been there by this passage."  "Then that's where it is taking us, no doubt.  I confess I shan't be sorry to see sunlight once more."  "Can you find time to think of sunlight?" asked Corpang with a rough smile.  "I love the sun, and perhaps I'm rather lacking in the spirit of a zealot."  "Yet, for all that, you may get there before me."  "Don't be bitter," said Maskull.  "I'll tell you another thing. Muspel can't be willed, for the simple reason that Muspel does not concern the will.  To will is a property of this world."  "Then what is your journey for?"  "It's one thing to walk to a destination, and to linger over the walk, and quite another to run there at top speed."  "Perhaps I'm not so easily deceived as you think," said Corpang with another smile.  The light persisted in the cave.  The path narrowed and became a steep ascent.  Then the angle became one of forty-five degrees, and they had to climb.  The tunnel grew so confined that Maskull was reminded of the confined dreams of his childhood.  Not long afterward, daylight appeared.  They hastened to complete the last stage.  Maskull rushed out first into the world of colours and, all dirty and bleeding from numerous scratches, stood blinking on a hillside, bathed in the brilliant late-afternoon sunshine.  Corpang followed closely at his heels, He was obliged to shield his eyes with his hands for a few minutes, so unaccustomed was he to Branchspell's blinding rays.  "The drum beats have stopped!" he exclaimed suddenly.  "You can't expect music all the time," answered Maskull dryly.  "We mustn't be luxurious."  "But now we have no guide.  We're no better off than before."  "Well, Tormance is a big place.  But I have an infallible rule, Corpang.  As I come from the south, I always go due north."  "That will take us to Lichstorm."  Maskull gazed at the fantastically piled rocks all around them.  "I saw these rocks from Matterplay.  The mountains look as far off now as they did them, and there's not much of the day left.  How far is Lichstorm from here?"  Corpang looked away to the distant range.  "I don't know, but unless a miracle happens we shan't get there tonight."  "I have a feeling," said Maskull, "that we shall not only get there tonight, but that tonight will be the most important in my life."  And he sat down passively to rest.    Chapter 18  HAUNTE  While Maskull sat, Corpang walked restlessly to and fro, swinging his arms.  He had lost his staff.  His face was inflamed with suppressed impatience, which accentuated its natural coarseness.  At last he stopped short in front of Maskull and looked down at him.  "What do you intend to do?"  Maskull glanced up and idly waved his hand toward the distant mountains.  "Since we can't walk, we must wait."  "For what?"  "I don't know... How's this, though?  Those peaks have changed colour, from red to green."  "Yes, the lich wind is travelling this way."  "The lich wind?"  "It's the atmosphere of Lichstorm.  It always clings to the mountains, but when the wind blows from the north it comes as far as Threal."  "It's a sort of fog, then?"  "A peculiar sort, for they say it excites the sexual passions."  "So we are to have lovemaking," said Maskull, laughing.  "Perhaps you won't find it so joyous," replied Corpang a little grimly.  "But tell me--these peaks, how do they preserve their balance?"  Corpang gazed at the distant, overhanging summits, which were fast fading into obscurity.  "Passion keeps them from falling."  Maskull laughed again; he was feeling a strange disturbance of spirit.  "What, the love of rock for rock?"  "It is comical, but true."  "We'll take a closer peep at them presently.  Beyond the mountains is Barey, is it not?"  "Yes."  "And then the Ocean.  But what is the name of that Ocean?"  "That is told only to those who die beside it."  "Is the secret so precious, Corpang?"  Branchspell was nearing the horizon in the west; there were more than two hours of daylight remaining.  The air all around them became murky.  It was a thin mist, neither damp nor cold.  The Lichstorm Range now appeared only as a blur on the sky.  The air was electric and tingling, and was exciting in its effect.  Maskull felt a sort of emotional inflammation, as though a very slight external cause would serve to overturn his self-control.  Corpang stood silent with a mouth like iron.  Maskull kept looking toward a high pile of rocks in the vicinity.  "That seems to me a good watchtower.  Perhaps we shall see something from the top."  Without waiting for his companion's opinion, he began to scramble up the tower, and in a few minutes was standing on the summit.  Corpang joined him.  From their viewpoint they saw the whole countryside sloping down to the sea, which appeared as a mere flash of far-off, glittering water. Leaving all that, however, Maskull's eyes immediately fastened themselves on a small, boat-shaped object, about two miles away, which was travelling rapidly toward them, suspended only a few feet in the air.  "What do you make of that?" he asked in a tone of astonishment.  Corpang shook his head and said nothing.  Within two minutes the flying object, whatever it was, had diminished the distance between them by one half.  It resembled a boat more and more, but its flight was erratic, rather than smooth; its nose was continually jerking upward and downward, and from side to side. Maskull now made out a man sitting in the stern, and what looked like a large dead animal lying amidships.  As the aerial craft drew nearer, he observed a thick, blue haze underneath it, and a similar haze behind, but the front, facing them, was clear.  "Here must be what we are waiting for, Corpang.  But what on earth carries it?"  He stroked his beard contemplatively, and then, fearing that they had not been seen, stepped onto the highest rock, bellowed loudly, and made wild motions with his arm.  The flying-boat, which was only a few hundred yards distant, slightly altered its course, now heading toward them in a way that left no doubt that the steersman had detected their presence.  The boat slackened speed until it was travelling no faster than a walking man, but the irregularity of its movements continued.  It was shaped rather queerly.  About twenty feet long, its straight sides tapered off from a flat bow, four feet broad, to a sharp-angled stern.  The flat bottom was not above ten feet from the ground.  It was undecked, and carried only one living occupant; the other object they had distinguished was really the carcass of an animal, of about the size of a large sheep.  The blue haze trailing behind the boat appeared to emanate from the glittering point of a short upright pole fastened in the stem.  When the craft was within a few feet of them, and they were looking down at it in wonder from above, the man removed this pole and covered the brightly shining tip with a cap. The forward motion then ceased altogether, and the boat began to drift hither and thither, but still it remained suspended in the air, while the haze underneath persisted.  Finally the broad side came gently up against the pile of rocks on which they were standing.  The steersman jumped ashore and immediately clambered up to meet them.  Maskull offered him a hand, but he refused it disdainfully.  He was a young man, of middle height.  He wore a close-fitting fur garment. His limbs were quite ordinary, but his trunk was disproportionately long, and he had the biggest and deepest chest that Maskull had ever seen in a man.  His hairless face was sharp, pointed, and ugly, with protruding teeth, and a spiteful, grinning expression.  His eyes and brows sloped upward.  On his forehead was an organ which looked as though it had been mutilated--it was a mere disagreeable stump of flesh.  His hair was short and thin.  Maskull could not name the colour of his skin, but it seemed to stand in the same relation to jale as green to red.  Once up, the stranger stood for a minute or two, scrutinising the two companions through half-closed lids, all the time smiling insolently. Maskull was all eagerness to exchange words, but did not care to be the first to speak.  Corpang stood moodily, a little in the background.  "What men are you?" demanded the aerial navigator at last.  His voice was extremely loud, and possessed a most unpleasant timbre.  It sounded to Maskull like a large volume of air trying to force its way through a narrow orifice.  "I am Maskull; my friend is Corpang.  He comes from Threal, but where I come from, don't ask."  "I am Haunte, from Sarclash."  "Where may that be?"  "Half an hour ago I could have shown it to you, but now it has got too murky.  It is a mountain in Lichstorm."  "Are you returning there now?"  "Yes."  "And how long will it take to get there in that boat?"  "Two--three hours."  "Will it accommodate us too?"  "What, are you for Lichstorm as well?  What can you want there?"  "To see the sights," responded Maskull with twinkling eyes.  "But first of all, to dine.  I can't remember having eaten all day.  You seem to have been hunting to some purpose, so we won't lack for food."  Haunte eyed him quizzically.  "You certainly don't lack impudence. However, I'm a man of that sort myself, and it is the sort I prefer. Your friend, now, would probably rather starve than ask a meal of a stranger.  He looks to me just like a bewildered toad dragged up out of a dark hole."  Maskull took Corpang's arm, and constrained him to silence.  "Where have you been hunting, Haunte?"  "Matterplay.  I had the worst luck--I speared one wold horse, and there it lies."  "What is Lichstorm like?"  "There are men there, and there are women there, but there are no men-women, as with you."  "What do you call men-women?"  "Persons of mixed sex, like yourself.  In Lichstorm the sexes are pure."  "I have always regarded myself as a man."  "Very likely you have; but the test is, do you hate and fear women?"  "Why, do you?"  Haunte grinned and showed his teeth.  "Things are different in Lichstorm....  So you want to see the sights?"  "I confess I am curious to see your women, for example, after what you say."  "Then I'll introduce you to Sullenbode."  He paused a moment after making this remark, and then suddenly uttered a great, bass laugh, so that his chest shook.  "Let us share the joke," said Maskull.  "Oh, you'll understand it later."  "If you play pranks with me, I won't stand on ceremony with you."  Haunte laughed again.  "I won't be the one to play pranks. Sullenbode will be deeply obliged to me.  If I don't visit her myself as often as she would like, I'm always glad to serve her in other ways....  Well, you shall have your boat ride."  Maskull rubbed his nose doubtfully.  "If the sexes hate one another in your land, is it because passion is weaker, or stronger?"  "In other parts of the world there is soft passion, but in Lichstorm there is hard passion."  "But what do you call hard passion?"  "Where men are called to women by pain, and not pleasure."  "I intend to understand, before I've finished."  "Yes," answered Haunte, with a taunting look, "it would be a pity to let the chance slip, since you're going to Lichstorm."  It was now Corpang's turn to take Maskull by the arm.  "This journey will end badly."  "Why so?"  "Your goal was Muspel a short while ago; now it is women."  "Let me alone," said Maskull.  "Give luck a slack rein.  What brought this boat here?"  "What is this talk about Muspel?" demanded Haunte.  Corpang caught his shoulder roughly, and stared straight into his eyes.  "What do you know?"  "Not much, but something, perhaps.  Ask me at supper.  Now it is high time to start.  Navigating the mountains by night isn't child's play, let me tell you."  "I shall not forget," said Corpang.  Maskull gazed down at the boat.  "Are we to get in?"  "Gently, my friend.  It's only canework and skin."  "First of all, you might enlighten me as to how you have contrived to dispense with the laws of gravitation."  Haunte smiled sarcastically.  "A secret in your ear, Maskull.  All laws are female.  A true male is an outlaw--outside the law."  "I don't understand."  "The great body of the earth is continually giving out female particles, and the male parts of rocks and living bodies are equally continually trying to reach them.  That's gravitation."  "Then how do you manage with your boat?"  "My two male stones do the work.  The one underneath the boat prevents it from falling to the ground; the one in the stem shuts it off from solid objects in the rear.  The only part of the boat attracted by any part of the earth is the bow, for that's the only part the light of the male stones does not fall on.  So in that direction the boat travels."  "And what are these wondrous male stones?"  "They really are male stones.  There is nothing female in them; they are showering out male sparks all the time.  These sparks devour all the female particles rising from the earth.  No female particles are left over to attract the male parts of the boat, and so they are not in the least attracted in that direction."  Maskull ruminated for a minute.  "With your hunting, and boatbuilding, and science, you seem a very handy, skilful fellow, Haunte....  But the sun's sinking, and we'd better start."  "Get down first, then, and shift that carcass farther forward.  Then you and your gloomy friend can sit amidships."  Maskull immediately climbed down, and dropped himself into the boat; but then he received a surprise.  The moment he stood on the frail bottom, still clinging to the rock, not only did his weight entirely disappear, as though he were floating in some heavy medium, like salt water, but the rock he held onto drew him, as by a mild current of electricity, and he was able to withdraw his hands only with difficulty.  After the first moment's shock, he quietly accepted the new order of things, and set about shifting the carcass.  Since there was no weight in the boat this was effected without any great labour. Corpang then descended.  The astonishing physical change had no power to disturb his settled composure, which was founded on moral ideas. Haunte came last; grasping the staff which held the upper male stone, he proceeded to erect it, after removing the cap.  Maskull then obtained his first near view of the mysterious light, which, by counteracting the forces of Nature, acted indirectly not only as elevator but as motive force.  In the last ruddy gleams of the great sun, its rays were obscured, and it looked little more impressive than an extremely brilliant, scintillating blue-white jewel, but its power could be gauged by the visible, coloured mist that it threw out for many yards around.  The steering was effected by means of a shutter attached by a cord to the top of the staff, which could be so manipulated that any segment of the male stone's rays, or all the rays, or none at all, could be shut off at will.  No sooner was the staff raised than the aerial vessel quietly detached itself from the rock to which it had been drawn, and passed slowly forward in the direction of the mountains. Branchspell sank below the horizon.  The gathering mist blotted out everything outside a radius of a few miles.  The air grew cool and fresh.  Soon the rock masses ceased on the great, rising plain.  Haunte withdrew the shutter entirely, and the boat gathered full speed.  "You say that navigation among the mountains is difficult at night," exclaimed Maskull.  "I would have thought it impossible."  Haunte grunted.  "You will have to take risks, and think yourself fortunate if you come off with nothing worse than a cracked skull. But one thing I can tell you--if you go on disturbing me with your chitchat we shan't get as far as the mountains."  Thereafter Maskull was silent.  The twilight deepened; the murk grew denser.  There was little to look at, but much to feel.  The motion of the boat, which was due to the never-ending struggle between the male stones and the force of gravitation, resembled in an exaggerated fashion the violent tossing of a small craft on a choppy sea.  The two passengers became unhappy. Haunte, from his seat in the stern, gazed at them sardonically with one eye.  The darkness now came on rapidly.  About ninety minutes after the commencement of the voyage they arrived at the foothills of Lichstorm.  They began to mount.  There was no daylight left to see by.  Beneath them, however, on both sides of them and in the rear, the landscape was lighted up for a considerable distance by the now vivid blue rays of the twin male stones.  Ahead, where these rays did not shine, Haunte was guided by the self-luminous nature of the rocks, grass, and trees.  These were faintly phosphorescent; the vegetation shone out more strongly than the soil.  The moon was not shining and there were no stars; Maskull therefore inferred that the upper atmosphere was dense with mist.  Once or twice, from his sensations of choking, he thought that they were entering a fogbank, but it was a strange kind of fog, for it had the effect of doubling the intensity of every light in front of them. Whenever this happened, nightmare feelings attacked him; he experienced transitory, unreasoning fright and horror.  Now they passed high above the valley that separated the foothills from the mountains themselves.  The boat began an ascent of many thousands of feet and, as the cliffs were near, Haunte had to manoeuvre carefully with the rear light in order to keep clear of them.  Maskull watched the delicacy of his movements, not without admiration.  A long time went by.  It grew much colder; the air was damp and drafty.  The fog began to deposit something like snow on their persons.  Maskull kept sweating with terror, not because of the danger they were in, but because of the cloud banks that continued to envelop them.  They cleared the first line of precipices.  Still mounting, but this time with a forward motion, as could be seen by the vapours illuminated by the male stones through which they passed, they were soon altogether out of sight of solid ground.  Suddenly and quite unexpectedly the moon broke through.  In the upper atmosphere thick masses of fog were seen crawling hither and thither, broken in many places by thin rifts of sky, through one of which Teargeld was shining.  Below them, to their left, a gigantic peak, glittering with green ice, showed itself for a few seconds, and was then swallowed up again.  All the rest of the world was hidden by the mist.  The moon went in again.  Maskull had seen quite enough to make him long for the aerial voyage to end.  The light from the male stones presently illuminated the face of a new cliff.  It was grand, rugged, and perpendicular.  Upward, downward, and on both sides, it faded imperceptibly into the night. After coasting it a little way, they observed a shelf of rock jutting out.  It was square, measuring about a dozen feet each way.  Green snow covered it to a depth of some inches.  Immediately behind it was a dark slit in the rock, which promised to be the mouth of a cave.  Haunte skilfully landed the boat on this platform.  Standing up, he raised the staff bearing the keel light and lowered the other; then removed both male stones, which he continued to hold in his hand. His face was thrown into strong relief by the vivid, sparkling blue- white rays.  It looked rather surly.  "Do we get out?" inquired Maskull.  "Yes.  I live here."  "Thanks for the successful end of a dangerous journey."  "Yes, it has been touch-and-go."  Corpang jumped onto the platform.  He was smiling coarsely.  "There has been no danger, for our destinies lie elsewhere.  You are merely a ferryman, Haunte."  "Is that so?" returned Haunte, with a most unpleasant laugh.  "I thought I was carrying men, not gods."  "Where are we?" asked Maskull.  As he spoke, he got out, but Haunte remained standing a minute in the boat.  "This is Sarclash--the second highest mountain in the land."  "Which is the highest, then?"  "Adage.  Between Sarclash and Adage there is a long ridge--very difficult in places.  About halfway along the ridge, at the lowest point, lies the top of the Mornstab Pass, which goes through to Barey.  Now you know the lay of the land."  "Does the woman Sullenbode live near here?"  "Near enough."  Haunte grinned.  He leaped out of the boat and, pushing past the others without ceremony, walked straight into the cave.  Maskull followed, with Corpang at his heels.  A few stone steps led to a doorway, curtained by the skin of some large beast.  Their host pushed his way in, never offering to hold the skin aside for them. Maskull made no comment, but grabbed it with his fist and tugged it away from its fastenings to the ground.  Haunte looked at the skin, and then stared hard at Maskull with his disagreeable smile, but neither said anything.  The place in which they found themselves was a large oblong cavern, with walls, floor, and ceiling of natural rock.  There were two doorways: that by which they had entered, and another of smaller size directly opposite.  The cave was cold and cheerless; a damp draft passed from door to door.  Many skins of wild animals lay scattered on the ground.  A number of lumps of sun-dried flesh were hanging on a string along the wall, and a few bulging liquor skins reposed in a corner.  There were tusks, horns, and bones everywhere.  Resting against the wall were two short hunting spears, having beautiful crystal heads.  Haunte set down the two male stones on the ground, near the farther door; their light illuminated the whole cave.  He then walked over to the meat and, snatching a large piece, began to gnaw it ravenously.  "Are we invited to the feast?" asked Maskull.  Haunte pointed to the hanging flesh and to the liquor skins, but did not pause in his chewing.  "Where's a cup?" inquired Maskull, lifting one of the skins.  Haunte indicated a clay goblet lying on the floor.  Maskull picked it up, undid the neck of the skin, and, resting it under his arm, filled the cup.  Tasting the liquor, he discovered it to be raw spirit.  He tossed off the draught, and then felt much better.  The second cupful he proffered to Corpang.  The latter took a single sip, swallowed it, and then passed the cup back without a word.  He refused to drink again, as long as they were in the cave.  Maskull finished the cup, and began to throw off care.  Going to the meat line, he took down a large double handful, and sat down on a pile of skins to eat at his ease.  The flesh was tough and coarse, but he had never tasted anything sweeter.  He could not understand the flavour, which was not surprising in a world of strange animals.  The meal proceeded in silence.  Corpang ate sparingly, standing up, and afterward lay down on a bundle of furs. His bold eyes watched all the movements of the other two.  Haunte had not drunk as yet.  At last Maskull concluded his meal.  He emptied another cup, sighed pleasantly, and prepared to talk.  "Now explain further about your women, Haunte."  Haunte fetched another skin of liquor and a second cup.  He tore off the string with his teeth, and poured out and drank cup after cup in quick succession.  Then he sat down, crossed his legs, and turned to Maskull.  "Well?"  "So they are objectionable?"  "They are deadly."  "Deadly?  In what way can they possibly be deadly?"  "You will learn.  I was watching you in the boat, Maskull.  You had some bad feelings, eh?"  "I don't conceal it.  There were times when I felt as if I were struggling with a nightmare.  What caused it?"  "The female atmosphere of Lichstorm.  Sexual passion."  "I had no passion."  "That was passion--the first stage.  Nature tickles your people into marriage, but it tortures us.  Wait till you get outside.  You'll have a return of those sensations--only ten times worse.  The drink you've had will see to that....  How do you suppose it will all end?"  "If I knew, I wouldn't be asking you questions."  Haunte laughed loudly.  "Sullenbode."  "You mean it will end in my seeking Sullenbode?"  "But what will come of it, Maskull?  What will she give you?  Sweet, fainting, white-armed, feminine voluptuousness?"  Maskull coolly drank another cup.  "And why should she give all that to a passerby?"  "Well, as a matter of fact, she hasn't it to give.  No, what she will give you, and what you'll accept from her, because you can't help it, is--anguish, insanity, possibly death."  "You may be talking sense, but it sounds like raving to me.  Why should I accept insanity and death?"  "Because your passion will force you to."  "What about yourself?" Maskull asked, biting his nails.  "Oh, I have my male stones.  I am immune."  "Is that all that prevents you from being like other men?"  "Yes, but don't attempt any tricks, Maskull."  Maskull went on drinking steadily, and said nothing for a time.  "So men and women here are hostile to each other, and love is unknown?" he proceeded at last.  "That magic word....  Shall I tell you what love is, Maskull?  Love between male and female is impossible.  When Maskull loves a woman, it is Maskull's female ancestors who are loving her.  But here in this land the men are pure males.  They have drawn nothing from the female side."  "Where do the male stones come from?"  "Oh, they are not freaks.  There must be whole beds of the stuff somewhere.  It is all that prevents the world from being a pure female world.  It would be one big mass of heavy sweetness, without individual shapes."  "Yet this same sweetness is torturing to men?"  "The life of an absolute male is fierce.  An excess of life is dangerous to the body.  How can it be anything else than torturing?"  Corpang now sat up suddenly, and addressed Haunte.  "I remind you of your promise to tell about Muspel."  Haunte regarded him with a malevolent smile.  "Ha!  The underground man has come to life."  "Yes, tell us," put in Maskull carelessly.  Haunte drank, and laughed a little.  "Well, the tale's short, and hardly worth telling, but since you're interested....  A stranger came here five years ago, inquiring after Muspel-light.  His name was Lodd.  He came from the east.  He came up to me one bright morning in summer, outside this very cave.  If you ask me to describe him--I can't imagine a second man like him.  He looked so proud, noble, superior, that I felt my own blood to be dirty by comparison.  You can guess I don't have this feeling for everyone.  Now that I am recalling him, he was not so much superior as different.  I was so impressed that I rose and talked to him standing.  He inquired the direction of the mountain Adage.  He went on to say, 'They say Muspel-light is sometimes seen there.  What do you know of such a thing?'  I told him the truth--that I knew nothing about it, and then he went on, 'Well, I am going to Adage.  And tell those who come after me on the same errand that they had better do the same thing.' That was the whole conversation.  He started on his way, and I've never seen him or heard of him since."  "So you didn't have the curiosity to follow him?"  "No, because the moment he had turned his back all my interest in the man somehow seemed to vanish."  "Probably because he was useless to you."  Corpang glanced at Maskull.  "Our road is marked out for us."  "So it would appear," said Maskull indifferently.  The talk flagged for a time.  Maskull felt the silence oppressive, and grew restless.  "What do you call the colour of your skin, Haunte, as I saw it in daylight?  It struck me as strange."  "Dolm," said Haunte.  "A compound of ulfire and blue," explained Corpang.  "Now I know.  These colours are puzzling for a stranger."  "What colours have you in your world?" asked Corpang.  "Only three primary ones, but here you seem to have five, though how it comes about I can't imagine."  "There are two sets of three primary colours here," said Corpang, "but as one of the colours--blue--is identical in both sets, altogether there are five primary colours."  "Why two sets?"  "Produced by the two suns.  Branchspell produces blue, yellow, and red; Alppain, ulfire, blue, and jale."  "It's remarkable that explanation has never occurred to me before."  "So here you have another illustration of the necessary trinity of nature.  Blue is existence.  It is darkness seen through light; a contrasting of existence and nothingness.  Yellow is relation.  In yellow light we see the relation of objects in the clearest way.  Red is feeling.  When we see red, we are thrown back on our personal feelings....  As regards the Alppain colours, blue stands in the middle and is therefore not existence, but relation.  Ulfire is existence; so it must be a different sort of existence."  Haunte yawned.  "There are marvellous philosophers in your underground hole."  Maskull got up and looked about him.  "Where does that other door lead to?"  "Better explore," said Haunte.  Maskull took him at his word, and strolled across the cave, flinging the curtain aside and disappearing into the night.  Haunte rose abruptly and hurried after him.  Corpang too got to his feet.  He went over to the untouched spirit skins, untied the necks, and allowed the contents to gush out on to the floor.  Next he took the hunting spears, and snapped off the points between his hands.  Before he had time to resume his seat, Haunte and Maskull reappeared.  The host's quick, shifty eyes at once took in what had happened.  He smiled, and turned pale.  "You haven't been idle, friend."  Corpang fixed Haunte with his bold, heavy gaze.  "I thought it well to draw your teeth."  Maskull burst out laughing.  "The toad's come into the light to some purpose, Haunte.  Who would have expected it?"  Haunte, after staring hard at Corpang for two or three minutes, suddenly uttered a strange cry, like an evil spirit, and flung himself upon him.  The two men began to wrestle like wildcats.  They were as often on the floor as on their legs, and Maskull could not see who was getting the better of it.  He made no attempt to separate them.  A thought came into his head and, snatching up the two male stones, he ran with them, laughing, through the upper doorway, into the open night air.  The door overlooked an abyss on another face of the mountain.  A narrow ledge, sprinkled with green snow, wound along the cliff to the right; it was the only available path.  He pitched the pebbles over the edge of the chasm.  Although hard and heavy in his hand, they sank more like feathers than stones, and left a long trail of vapour behind.  While Maskull was still watching them disappear, Haunte came rushing out of the cavern, followed by Corpang.  He gripped Maskull's arm excitedly.  "What in Krag's name have you done?"  "Overboard they have gone," replied Maskull, renewing his laughter.  "You accursed madman!"  Haunte's luminous colour came and went, just as though his internal light were breathing.  Then he grew suddenly calm, by a supreme exertion of his will.  "You know this kills me?"  "Haven't you been doing your best this last hour to make me ripe for Sullenbode?  Well then, cheer up, and join the pleasure party!"  "You say it as a joke, but it is the miserable truth."  Haunte's jeering malevolence had completely vanished.  He looked a sick man--yet somehow his face had become nobler.  "I would be very sorry for you, Haunte, if it did not entail my being also very sorry for myself.  We are now all three together on the same errand--which doesn't appear to have struck you yet."  "But why this errand at all?" asked Corpang quietly.  "Can't you men exercise self-control till you have arrived out of danger?"  Haunte fixed him with wild eyes.  "No.  The phantoms come trooping in on me already."  He sat down moodily, but the next minute was up again.  "And I cannot wait.... the game is started."  Soon afterward, by silent consent, they began to walk the ledge, Haunte in front.  It was narrow, ascending, and slippery, so that extreme caution was demanded.  The way was lighted by the self- luminous snow and rocks.  When they had covered about half a mile, Maskull, who went second of the party, staggered, caught the cliff, and finally sat down.  "The drink works.  My old sensations are returning, but worse."  Haunte turned back.  "Then you are a doomed man."  Maskull, though fully conscious of his companions and situation, imagined that he was being oppressed by a black, shapeless, supernatural being, who was trying to clasp him.  He was filled with horror, trembled violently, yet could not move a limb.  Sweat tumbled off his face in great drops.  The waking nightmare lasted a long time, but during that space it kept coming and going.  At one moment the vision seemed on the point of departing; the next it almost took shape--which he knew would be his death.  Suddenly it vanished altogether--he was free.  A fresh spring breeze fanned his face; he heard the slow, solitary singing of a sweet bird; and it seemed to him as if a poem had shot together in his soul.  Such flashing, heartbreaking joy he had never experienced before in all his life! Almost immediately that too vanished.  Sitting up, he passed his hand across his eyes and swayed quietly, like one who has been visited by an angel.  "Your colour changed to white," said Corpang.  "What happened?"  "I passed through torture to love," replied Maskull simply.  He stood up.  Haunte gazed at him sombrely.  "Will you not describe that passage?"  Maskull answered slowly and thoughtfully.  "When I was in Matterplay, I saw heavy clouds discharge themselves and change to coloured, living animals.  In the same way, my black, chaotic pangs just now seemed to consolidate themselves and spring together as a new sort of joy.  The joy would not have been possible without the preliminary nightmare.  It is not accidental; Nature intends it so.  The truth has just flashed through my brain....  You men of Lichstorm don't go far enough.  You stop at the pangs, Without realising that they are birth pangs."  "If this is true, you are a great pioneer," muttered Haunte.  "How does this sensation differ from common love?" interrogated Corpang.  "This was all that love is, multiplied by wildness."  Corpang fingered his chin awhile.  "The Lichstorm men, however, will never reach this stage, for they are too masculine."  Haunte turned pale.  "Why should we alone suffer?"  "Nature is freakish and cruel, and doesn't act according to justice....  Follow us, Haunte, and escape from it all."  "I'll see," muttered Haunte.  "Perhaps I will."  "Have we far to go, to Sullenbode?" inquired Maskull.  "No, her home's under the hanging cap of Sarclash."  "What is to happen tonight?"  Maskull spoke to himself, but Haunte answered him.  "Don't expect anything pleasant, in spite of what has just occurred. She is not a woman, but a mass of pure sex.  Your passion will draw her out into human shape, but only for a moment.  If the change were permanent, you would have endowed her with a soul."  "Perhaps the change might be made permanent."  "To do that, it is not enough to desire her; she must desire you as well.  But why should she desire you?"  "Nothing turns out as one expects," said Maskull, shaking his head. "We had better get on again."  They resumed the journey.  The ledge still rose, but, on turning a corner of the cliff, Haunte quitted it and began to climb a steep gully, which mounted directly to the upper heights.  Here they were compelled to use both hands and feet.  Maskull thought all the while of nothing but the overwhelming sweetness he had just experienced.  The flat ground on top was dry and springy.  There was no more snow, and bright plants appeared.  Haunte turned sharply to the left.  "This must be under the cap," said Maskull.  "It is; and within five minutes you will see Sullenbode."  When he spoke his words, Maskull's lips surprised him by their tender sensitiveness.  Their action against each other sent thrills throughout his body.  The grass shone dimly.  A huge tree, with glowing branches, came into sight.  It bore a multitude of red fruit, like hanging lanterns, but no leaves.  Underneath this tree Sullenbode was sitting.  Her beautiful light--a mingling of jale and white--gleamed softly through the darkness.  She sat erect, on crossed legs, asleep.  She was clothed in a singular skin garment, which started as a cloak thrown over one shoulder, and ended as loose breeches terminating above the knees.  Her forearms were lightly folded, and in one hand she held a half-eaten fruit.  Maskull stood over her and looked down, deeply interested.  He thought he had never seen anything half so feminine.  Her flesh was almost melting in its softness.  So undeveloped were the facial organs that they looked scarcely human; only the lips were full, pouting, and expressive.  In their richness, these lips seemed like a splash of vivid will on a background of slumbering protoplasm.  Her hair was undressed.  Its colour could not be distinguished.  It was long and tangled, and had been tucked into her garment behind, for convenience.  Corpang looked calm and sullen, but both the others were visibly agitated.  Maskull's heart was hammering away under his chest. Haunte pulled him, and said, "My head feels as if it were being torn from my shoulders."  "What can that mean?"  "Yet there's a horrible joy in it," added Haunte, with a sickly smile.  He put his hand on the woman's shoulder.  She awoke softly, glanced up at them, smiled, and then resumed eating her fruit.  Maskull did not imagine that she had intelligence enough to speak.  Haunte suddenly dropped on his knees, and kissed her lips.  She did not repulse him.  During the continuance of the kiss, Maskull noticed with a shock that her face was altering.  The features emerged from their indistinctness and became human, and almost powerful.  The smile faded, a scowl took its place.  She thrust Haunte away, rose to her feet, and stared beneath bent brows at the three men, each one in turn.  Maskull came last; his face she studied for quite a long time, but nothing indicated what she thought.  Meanwhile Haunte again approached her, staggering and grinning.  She suffered him quietly; but the instant lips met lips the second time, he fell backward with a startled cry, as though he had come in contact with an electric wire.  The back of his head struck the ground, and he lay there motionless.  Corpang sprang forward to his assistance.  But, when he saw what had happened, he left him where he was.  "Maskull, come here quickly!"  The light was perceptibly fading from Haunte's skin, as Maskull bent over.  The man was dead.  His face was unrecognisable.  The head had been split from the top downward into two halves, streaming with strange-coloured blood, as though it had received a terrible blow from an axe.  "This couldn't be from the fall," said Maskull.  "No, Sullenbode did it."  Maskull turned quickly to look at the woman.  She had resumed her former attitude on the ground.  The momentary intelligence had vanished from her face, and she was again smiling.    Chapter 19  SULLENBODE  Sullenbode's naked skin glowed softly through the darkness, but the clothed part of her person was invisible.  Maskull watched her senseless, smiling face, and shivered.  Strange feelings ran through his body.  Corpang spoke out of the night.  "She looks like an evil spirit filled with deadliness."  "It was like deliberately kissing lightning."  "Haunte was insane with passion."  "So am I," said Maskull quietly.  "My body seems full of rocks, all grinding against one another."  "This is what I was afraid of."  "It appears I shall have to kiss her too."  Corpang pulled his arm.  "Have you lost all manliness?"  But Maskull impatiently shook himself free.  He plucked nervously at his beard, and stared at Sullenbode.  His lips kept twitching.  After this had gone on for a few minutes, he stepped forward, bent over the woman, and lifted her bodily in his arms.  Setting her upright against the rugged tree trunk, he kissed her.  A cold, knifelike shock passed down his frame.  He thought that it was death, and lost consciousness.  When his sense returned, Sullenbode was holding him by the shoulder with one hand at arm's length, searching his face with gloomy eyes. At first he failed to recognise her; it was not the woman he had kissed, but another.  Then he gradually realised that her face was identical with that which Haunte's action had called into existence. A great calmness came upon him; his bad sensations had disappeared.  Sullenbode was transformed into a living soul.  Her skin was firm, her features were strong, her eyes gleamed with the consciousness of power.  She was tall and slight, but slow in all her gestures and movements.  Her face was not beautiful.  It was long, and palely lighted, while the mouth crossed the lower half like a gash of fire. The lips were as voluptuous as before.  Her brows were heavy.  There was nothing vulgar in her--she looked the kingliest of all women. She appeared not more than twenty-five.  Growing tired, apparently, of his scrutiny, she pushed him a little way and allowed her arm to drop, at the same time curving her mouth into a long, bowlike smile.  "Whom have I to thank for this gift of life?"  Her voice was rich, slow, and odd.  Maskull felt himself in a dream.  "My name is Maskull."  She motioned to him to come a step nearer.  "Listen, Maskull.  Man after man has drawn me into the world, but they could not keep me there, for I did not wish it.  But now you have drawn me into it for all time, for good or evil."  Maskull stretched a hand toward the now invisible corpse, and said quietly, "What have you to say about him?"  "Who was it?"  "Haunte."  "So that was Haunte.  The news will travel far and wide.  He was a famous man."  "It's a horrible affair.  I can't think that you killed him deliberately."  "We women are endowed with terrible power, but it is our only protection.  We do not want these visits; we loathe them."  "I might have died, too."  "You came together?"  "There were three of us.  Corpang still stands over there."  "I see a faintly glimmering form.  What do you want of me, Corpang?"  "Nothing."  "Then go away, and leave me with Maskull."  "No need, Corpang.  I am coming with you."  "This is not that pleasure, then?" demanded the low, earnest voice, out of the darkness.  "No, that pleasure has not returned."  Sullenbode gripped his arm hard.  "What pleasure are you speaking of?"  "A presentiment of love, which I felt not long ago."  "But what do you feel now?"  "Calm and free."  Sullenbode's face seemed like a pallid mask, hiding a slow, swelling sea of elemental passions.  "I do not know how it will end, Maskull, but we will still keep together a little.  Where are you going?"  "To Adage," said Corpang, stepping forward.  "But why?"  "We are following the steps of Lodd, who went there years ago, to find Muspel-light."  "It's the light of another world."  "The quest is grand.  But cannot women see that light?"  "On one condition," said Corpang.  "They must forget their sex. Womanhood and love belong to life, while Muspel is above life."  "I give you all other men," said Sullenbode.  "Maskull is mine."  "No. I am not here to help Maskull to a lover but to remind him of the existence of nobler things."  "You are a good man.  But you two alone will never strike the road to Adage."  "Are you acquainted with it?"  Again the woman gripped Maskull's arm.  "What is love--which Corpang despises?"  Maskull looked at her attentively.  Sullenbode went on, "Love is that which is perfectly willing to disappear and become nothing, for the sake of the beloved."  Corpang wrinkled his forehead.  "A magnanimous female lover is new in my experience."  Maskull put him aside with his hand, and said to Sullenbode, "Are you contemplating a sacrifice?"  She gazed at her feet, and smiled.  "What does it matter what my thoughts are?  Tell me, are you starting at once, or do you mean to rest first?  It's a rough road to Adage."  "What's in your mind?" demanded Maskull.  "I will guide you a little.  When we reach the ridge between Sarclash and Adage, perhaps I shall turn back."  "And then?"  "Then if the moon shines perhaps you will arrive before daybreak, but if it is dark it's hardly likely."  "That's not what I meant.  What will become of you after we have parted company?"  "I shall return somewhere--perhaps here."  Maskull went close up to her, in order to study her face better. "Shall you sink back into--the old state?"  "No, Maskull, thank heaven."  "Then how will you live?"  Sullenbode calmly removed the hand which he had placed on her arm. There was a sort of swirling flame in her eyes.  "And who said I would go on living?"  Maskull blinked at her in bewilderment.  A few moments passed before he spoke again.  "You women are a sacrificing lot.  You know I can't leave you like this."  Their eyes met.  Neither withdrew them, and neither felt embarrassed.  "You will always be the most generous of men, Maskull.  Now let us go....  Corpang is a single-minded personage, and the least we others--who aren't so single-minded--can do is to help him to his destination.  We mustn't inquire whether the destination of single- minded men is as a rule worth arriving at."  "If it is good for Maskull, it will be good for me."  "Well, no vessel can hold more than its appointed measure."  Corpang gave a wry smile.  "During your long sleep you appear to have picked up wisdom."  "Yes, Corpang, I have met many men, and explored many minds."  As they moved off, Maskull remembered Haunte.  "Can we not bury that poor fellow?"  "By this time tomorrow we shall need burial ourselves.  But I do not include Corpang."  "We have no tools, so you must have your way.  You killed him, but I am the real murderer.  I stole his protecting light."  "Surely that death is balanced by the life you have given me."  They left the spot in the direction opposite to that by which the three men had arrived.  After a few steps, they came to green snow again. At the same time the flat ground ended, and they started to traverse a steep, pathless mountain slope.  The snow and rocks glimmered, their own bodies shone; otherwise everything was dark.  The mists swirled around them, but Maskull had no more nightmares.  The breeze was cold, pure, and steady.  They walked in file, Sullenbode leading; her movements were slow and fascinating.  Corpang came last.  His stern eyes saw nothing ahead but an alluring girl and a half- infatuated man.  For a long time they continued crossing the rough and rocky slope, maintaining a slightly upward course.  The angle was so steep that a false step would have been fatal.  The high ground was on their right.  After a while, the hillside on the left hand changed to level ground, and they seemed to have joined another spur of the mountain. The ascending slope on the right hand persisted for a few hundred yards more.  Then Sullenbode bore sharply to the left, and they found level ground all around them.  "We are on the ridge," announced the woman, halting.  The others came up to her, and at the same instant the moon burst through the clouds, illuminating the whole scene.  Maskull uttered a cry.  The wild, noble, lonely beauty of the view was quite unexpected.  Teargeld was high in the sky to their left, shining down on them from behind.  Straight in front, like an enormously wide, smoothly descending road, lay the great ridge which went on to Adage, though Adage itself was out of sight.  It was never less than two hundred yards wide.  It was covered with green snow, in some places entirely, but in other places the naked rocks showed through like black teeth.  From where they stood they were unable to see the sides of the ridge, or what lay underneath.  On the right hand, which was north, the landscape was blurred and indistinct. There were no peaks there; it was the distant, low-lying land of Barey.  But on the left hand appeared a whole forest of mighty pinnacles, near and far, as far as the eye could see in moonlight. All glittered green, and all possessed the extraordinary hanging caps that characterised the Lichstorm range.  These caps were of fantastic shapes, and each one was different.  The valley directly opposite them was filled with rolling mist.  Sarclash was a mighty mountain mass in the shape of a horseshoe.  Its two ends pointed west, and were separated from each other by a mile or more of empty space.  The northern end became the ridge on which they stood.  The southern end was the long line of cliffs on that part of the mountain where Haunte's cave was situated.  The connecting curve was the steep slope they had just traversed.  One peak of Sarclash was invisible.  In the south-west many mountains raised their heads.  In addition, a few summits, which must have been of extraordinary height, appeared over the south side of the horseshoe.  Maskull turned round to put a question to Sullenbode, but when he saw her for the first time in moonlight the words he had framed died on his lips.  The gashlike mouth no longer dominated her other features, and the face, pale as ivory and most femininely shaped, suddenly became almost beautiful.  The lips were a long, womanish curve of rose-red.  Her hair was a dark maroon.  Maskull was greatly disturbed; he thought that she resembled a spirit, rather than a woman.  "What puzzles you?" she asked, smiling.  "Nothing.  But I would like to see you by sunlight."  "Perhaps you never will."  "Your life must be most solitary."  She explored his features with her black, slow-gleaming eyes.  "Why do you fear to speak your feelings, Maskull?"  "Things seem to open up before me like a sunrise, but what it means I can't say."  Sullenbode laughed outright.  "It assuredly does not mean the approach of night."  Corpang, who had been staring steadily along the ridge, here abruptly broke in.  "The road is plain now, Maskull.  If you wish it, I'll go on alone."  "No, we'll go on together.  Sullenbode will accompany us."  "A little way," said the woman, "but not to Adage, to pit my strength against unseen powers.  That light is not for me.  I know how to renounce love, but I will never be a traitor to it."  "Who knows what we shall find on Adage, or what will happen?  Corpang is as ignorant as myself."  Corpang looked him full in the face.  "Maskull, you are quite well aware that you never dare approach that awful fire in the society of a beautiful woman."  Maskull gave an uneasy laugh.  "What Corpang doesn't tell you, Sullenbode, is that I am far better acquainted with Muspel-light than he, and that, but for a chance meeting with me, he would still be saying his prayers in Threal."  "Still, what he says must be true," she replied, looking from one to the other.  "And so I am not to be allowed to--"  "So long as I am with you, I shall urge you onward, and not backward, Maskull."  "We need not quarrel yet," he remarked, with a forced smile.  "No doubt things will straighten themselves out."  Sullenbode began kicking the snow about with her foot.  "I picked up another piece of wisdom in my sleep, Corpang."  "Tell it to me, then."  "Men who live by laws and rules are parasites.  Others shed their strength to bring these laws out of nothing into the light of day, but the law-abiders live at their ease--they have conquered nothing for themselves."  "It is given to some to discover, and to others to preserve and perfect.  You cannot condemn me for wishing Maskull well."  "No, but a child cannot lead a thunderstorm."  They started walking again along the centre of the ridge.  All three were abreast, Sullenbode in the middle.  The road descended by an easy gradient, and was for a long distance comparatively smooth.  The freezing point seemed higher than on Earth, for the few inches of snow through which they trudged felt almost warm to their naked feet.  Maskull's soles were by now like tough hides.  The moonlit snow was green and dazzling.  Their slanting, abbreviated shadows were sharply defined, and red-black in colour.  Maskull, who walked on Sullenbode's right hand, looked constantly to the left, toward the galaxy of glorious distant peaks.  "You cannot belong to this world," said the woman.  "Men of your stamp are not to be looked for here."  "No, I have come here from Earth."  "Is that larger than our world?"  "Smaller, I think.  Small, and overcrowded with men and women.  With all those people, confusion would result but for orderly laws, and therefore the laws are of iron.  As adventure would be impossible without encroaching on these laws, there is no longer any spirit of adventure among the Earthmen.  Everything is safe, vulgar, and completed."  "Do men hate women there, and women men?"  "No, the meeting of the sexes is sweet, though shameful.  So poignant is the sweetness that the accompanying shame is ignored, with open eyes.  There is no hatred, or only among a few eccentric persons."  "That shame surely must be the rudiment of our Lichstorm passion. But now say--why did you come here?"  "To meet with new experiences, perhaps.  The old ones no longer interested me."  "How long have you been in this world?"  "This is the end of my fourth day."  "Then tell me what you have seen and done during those four days. You cannot have been inactive."  "Great misfortunes have happened to me."  He proceeded briefly to relate everything that had taken place from the moment of his first awakening in the scarlet desert.  Sullenbode listened, with half-closed eyes, nodding her head from time to time. only twice did she interrupt him.  After his description of Tydomin's death, she said, speaking in a low voice--"None of us women ought by right of nature to fall short of Tydomin in sacrifice.  For that one act of hers, I almost love her, although she brought evil to your door."  Again, speaking of Gleameil, she remarked, "That grand-souled girl I admire the most of all.  She listened to her inner voice, and to nothing else besides.  Which of us others is strong enough for that?"  When his tale was quite over, Sullenbode said, "Does it not strike you, Maskull, that these women you have met have been far nobler than the men?"  "I recognise that.  We men often sacrifice ourselves, but only for a substantial cause.  For you women almost any cause will serve.  You love the sacrifice for its own sake, and that is because you are naturally noble."  Turning her head a little, she threw him a smile so proud, yet so sweet, that he was struck into silence.  They tramped on quietly for some distance, and then he said, "Now you understand the sort of man I am.  Much brutality, more weakness, scant pity for anyone--Oh, it has been a bloody journey!"  She laid her hand on his arm.  "I, for one, would not have it less rugged."  "Nothing good can be said of my crimes."  "To me you seem like a lonely giant, searching for you know not what....  The grandest that life holds....  You at least have no cause to look up to women."  "Thanks, Sullenbode!" he responded, with a troubled smile.  "When Maskull passes, let people watch.  Everyone is thrown out of your road.  You go on, looking neither to right nor left."  "Take care that you are not thrown as well," said Corpang gravely.  "Maskull shall do with me whatever he pleases, old skull!  And for whatever he does, I will thank him....  In place of a heart you have a bag of loose dust.  Someone has described love to you.  You have had it described to you.  You have heard that it is a small, fearful, selfish joy.  It is not that--it is wild, and scornful, and sportive, and bloody....  How should you know."  "Selfishness has far too many disguises."  "If a woman wills to give up all, what can there be selfish in that?"  "Only do not deceive yourself.  Act decisively, or fate will be too swift for you both."  Sullenbode studied him through her lashes.  "Do you mean death--his death as well as mine?"  "You go too far, Corpang," said Maskull, turning a shade darker.  "I don't accept you as the arbiter of our fortunes."  "If honest counsel is disagreeable to you, let me go on ahead."  The woman detained him with her slow, light fingers.  "I wish you to stay with us."  "Why?"  "I think you may know what you are talking about.  I don't wish to bring harm to Maskull.  Presently I'll leave you."  "That will be best," said Corpang.  Maskull looked angry.  "I shall decide--Sullenbode, whether you go on, or back, I stay with you.  My mind is made up."  An expression of joyousness overspread her face, in spite of her efforts to conceal it.  "Why do you scowl at me, Maskull?"  He returned no answer, but continued walking onward with puckered brows.  After a dozen paces or so, he halted abruptly.  "Wait, Sullenbode!"  The others came to a standstill.  Corpang looked puzzled, but the woman smiled.  Maskull, without a word, bent over and kissed her lips.  Then he relinquished her body, and turned around to Corpang.  "How do you, in your great wisdom, interpret that kiss?"  "It requires no great wisdom to interpret kisses, Maskull."  "Hereafter, never dare to come between us.  Sullenbode belongs to me."  "Then I say no more; but you are a fated man."  From that time forward he spoke not another word to either of the others.  A heavy gleam appeared in the woman's eyes.  "Now things are changed, Maskull.  Where are you taking me?"  "Choose, you."  "The man I love must complete his journey.  I won't have it otherwise. You shall not stand lower than Corpang."  "Where you go, I will go."  "And I--as long as your love endures, I will accompany you even to Adage."  "Do you doubt its lasting?"  "I wish not to....  Now I will tell you what I refused to tell you before.  The term of your love is the term of my life.  When you love me no longer, I must die."  "And why?" asked Maskull slowly.  "Yes, that's the responsibility you incurred when you kissed me for the first time.  I never meant to tell you."  "Do you mean that if I had gone on alone, you would have died?"  "I have no other life but what you give me."  He gazed at her mournfully, without attempting to reply, and then slowly placed his arms around her body.  During this embrace he turned very pale, but Sullenbode grew as white as chalk.  A few minutes later the journey toward Adage was resumed.  They had been walking for two hours.  Teargeld was higher in the sky and nearer the south.  They had descended many hundred feet, and the character of the ridge began to alter for the worse.  The thin snow disappeared, and gave way to moist, boggy ground.  It was all little grassy hillocks and marshes.  They began to slip about and become draggled with mud.  Conversation ceased; Sullenbode led the way, and the men followed in her tracks.  The southern half of the landscape grew grander.  The greenish light of the brilliant moon, shining on the multitude of snow-green peaks, caused it to appear like a spectral world.  Their nearest neighbour towered high above them on the other side of the valley, due south, some five miles distant.  It was a slender, inaccessible, dizzy spire of black rock, the angles of which were too steep to retain snow.  A great upward-curving horn of rock sprang out from its topmost pinnacle.  For a long time it constituted their clues landmark.  The whole ridge gradually became saturated with moisture.  The surface soil was spongy, and rested on impermeable rock; it breathed in the damp mists by night, and breathed them out again by day, under Branchspell's rays.  The walking grew first unpleasant, then difficult, and finally dangerous.  None of the party could distinguish firm ground from bog.  Sullenbode sank up to her waist in a pit of slime; Maskull rescued her, but after this incident took the lead himself.  Corpang was the next to meet with trouble.  Exploring a new path for himself, he tumbled into liquid mud up to his shoulders, and narrowly escaped a filthy death.  After Maskull had got him out, at great personal risk, they proceeded once more; but now the scramble changed from bad to worse.  Each step had to be thoroughly tested before weight was put upon it, and even so the test frequently failed.  All of them went in so often, that in the end they no longer resembled human beings, but walking pillars plastered from top to toe with black filth.  The hardest work fell to Maskull. He not only had the exhausting task of beating the way, but was continually called upon to help his companions out of their difficulties.  Without him they could not have got through.  After a peculiarly evil patch, they paused to recruit their strength. Corpang's breathing was difficult, Sullenbode was quiet, listless, and depressed.  Maskull gazed at them doubtfully.  "Does this continue?" he inquired.  "No. I think," replied the woman, "we can't be far from the Mornstab Pass.  After that we shall begin to climb again, and then the road will improve perhaps."  "Can you have been here before?"  "Once I have been to the Pass, but it was not so bad then."  "You are tired out, Sullenbode."  "What of it?" she replied, smiling faintly.  "When one has a terrible lover, one must pay the price."  "We cannot get there tonight, so let us stop at the first shelter we come too."  "I leave it to you."  He paced up and down, while the others sat.  "Do you regret anything?" he demanded suddenly.  "No, Maskull, nothing.  I regret nothing."  "Your feelings are unchanged?"  "Love can't go back--it can only go on."  "Yes, eternally on.  It is so."  "No, I don't mean that.  There is a climax, but when the climax has been reached, love if it still wants to ascend must turn to sacrifice."  "That's a dreadful creed," he said in a low voice, turning pale beneath his coating of mud.  "Perhaps my nature is discordant....  I am tired.  I don't know what I feel."  In a few minutes they were on their feet again, and the journey recommenced.  Within half an hour they had reached the Mornstab Pass.  The ground here was drier; the broken land to the north served to drain off the moisture of the soil.  Sullenbode led them to the northern edge of the ridge, to show them the nature of the country. The pass was nothing but a gigantic landslip on both sides of the ridge, where it was the lowest above the underlying land.  A series of huge broken terraces of earth and rock descended toward Barey. They were overgrown with stunted vegetation.  It was quite possible to get down to the lowlands that way, but rather difficult.  On either side of the landslip, to cast and west, the ridge came down in a long line of sheer, terrific cliffs.  A low haze concealed Barey from view.  Complete stillness was in the air, broken only by the distant thundering of an invisible waterfall.  Maskull and Sullenbode sat down on a boulder, facing the open country.  The moon was directly behind them, high up.  It was almost as light as an Earth day.  "Tonight is like life," said Sullenbode.  "How so?"  "So lovely above and around us, so foul underfoot."  Maskull sighed.  "Poor girl, you are unhappy."  "And you--are you happy?"  He thought a while, and then replied--"No.  No, I'm not happy.  Love is not happiness."  "What is it, Maskull?"  "Restlessness--unshed tears--thoughts too grand for our soul to think..."  "Yes," said Sullenbode.  After a time she asked, "Why were we created, just to live for a few years and then disappear?"  "We are told that we shall live again."  "Yes, Maskull?"  "Perhaps in Muspel," he added thoughtfully.  "What kind of life will that be?"  "Surely we shall meet again.  Love is too wonderful and mysterious a thing to remain uncompleted."  She gave a slight shiver, and turned away from him.  "This dream is untrue.  Love is completed here."  "How can that be, when sooner or later it is brutally interrupted by Fate?"  "It is completed by anguish....  Oh, why must it always be enjoyment for us?  Can't we suffer--can't we go on suffering, forever and ever?  Maskull, until love crushes our spirit, finally and without remedy, we don't begin to feel ourselves."  Maskull gazed at her with a troubled expression.  "Can the memory of love be worth more than its presence and reality?"  "You don't understand.  Those pangs are more precious than all the rest beside."  She caught at him.  "Oh, if you could only see inside my mind, Maskull!  You would see strange things....  I can't explain. It is all confused, even to myself....  This love is quite different from what I thought."  He sighed again.  "Love is a strong drink.  Perhaps it is too strong for human beings.  And I think that it overtures our reason in different ways."  They remained sitting side by side, staring straight before them with unseeing eyes.  "It doesn't matter," said Sullenbode at last, with a smile, getting up.  "Soon it will be ended, one way or another.  Come, let us be off!"  Maskull too got up.  "Where's Corpang?" he asked listlessly.  They both looked across the ridge in the direction of Adage.  At the point where they stood it was nearly a mile wide.  It sloped perceptibly toward the southern edge, giving all the earth the appearance of a heavy list.  Toward the west the ground continued level for a thousand yards, but then a high, sloping, grassy hill went right across the ridge from side to side, like a vast billow on the verge of breaking.  It shut out all further view beyond.  The whole crest of this hill, from one end to the other, was crowned by a long row of enormous stone posts, shining brightly in the moonlight against a background of dark sky.  There were about thirty in all, and they were placed at such regular intervals that there was little doubt that they had been set there by human hands.  Some were perpendicular, but others dipped so much that an aspect of extreme antiquity was given to the entire colonnade.  Corpang was seen climbing the hill, not far from the top.  "He wishes to arrive," said Maskull, watching the energetic ascent with a rather cynical smile.  "The heavens won't open for Corpang," returned Sullenbode.  "He need not be in such a hurry....  What do these pillars seem like to you?"  "They might be the entrance to some mighty temple.  Who can have planted them there?"  She did not answer.  They watched Corpang gain the summit of the hill, and disappear through the line of posts.  Maskull turned again to Sullenbode.  "Now we two are alone in a lonely world."  She regarded him steadily.  "Our last night on this earth must be a grand one.  I am ready to go on."  "I don't think you are fit to go on.  It will be better to go down the pass a little, and find shelter."  She half smiled.  "We won't study our poor bodies tonight.  I mean you to go to Adage, Maskull."  "Then at all events let us rest first, for it must be a long, terrible climb, and who knows what hardships we shall meet?"  She walked a step or two forward, half turned, and held out her hand to him.  "Come, Maskull!"  When they had covered half the distance that separated them from the foot of the hill, Maskull heard the drum taps.  They came from behind the hill, and were loud, sharp, almost explosive.  He glanced at Sullenbode, but she appeared to hear nothing.  A minute later the whole sky behind and above the long chain of stone posts on the crest of the hill began to be illuminated by a strange radiance.  The moonlight in that quarter faded; the posts stood out black on a background of fire.  It was the light of Muspel.  As the moments passed, it grew more and more vivid, peculiar, and awful.  It was of no colour, and resembled nothing--it was supernatural and indescribable.  Maskull's spirit swelled.  He stood fast, with expanded nostrils and terrible eyes.  Sullenbode touched him lightly.  "What do you see, Maskull?"  "Muspel-light."  "I see nothing."  The light shot up, until Maskull scarcely knew where he stood.  It burned with a fiercer and stranger glare than ever before.  He forgot the existence of Sullenbode.  The drum beats grew deafeningly loud. Each beat was like a rip of startling thunder, crashing through the sky and making the air tremble.  Presently the crashes coalesced, and one continuous roar of thunder rocked the world.  But the rhythm persisted--the four beats, with the third accented, still came pulsing through the atmosphere, only now against a background of thunder, and not of silence.  Maskull's heart beat wildly.  His body was like a prison.  He longed to throw it off, to spring up and become incorporated with the sublime universe which was beginning to unveil itself.  Sullenbode suddenly enfolded him in her arms, and kissed him-- passionately, again and again.  He made no response; he was unaware of what she was doing.  She unclasped him and, with bent head and streaming eyes, went noiselessly away.  She started to go back toward the Mornstab Pass.  A few minutes afterward the radiance began to fade.  The thunder died down.  The moonlight reappeared, the stone posts and the hillside were again bright.  In a short time the supernatural light had entirely vanished, but the drum taps still sounded faintly, a muffled rhythm, from behind the hill.  Maskull started violently, and stared around him like a suddenly awakened sleeper.  He saw Sullenbode walking slowly away from him, a few hundred yards off.  At that sight, death entered his heart.  He ran after her, calling out....  She did not look around.  When he had lessened the distance between them by a half, he saw her suddenly stumble and fall.  She did not get up again, but lay motionless where she fell.  He flew toward her, and bent over her body.  His worst fears were realised.  Life had departed.  Beneath its coating of mud, her face bore the vulgar, ghastly Crystalman grin, but Maskull saw nothing of it.  She had never appeared so beautiful to him as at that moment.  He remained beside her for a long time, on his knees.  He wept--but, between his fits of weeping, he raised his head from time to time, and listened to the distant drum beats.  An hour passed--two hours.  Teargeld was now in the south-west. Maskull lifted Sullenbode's dead body on to his shoulders, and started to walk toward the Pass.  He cared no more for Muspel.  He intended to look for water in which to wash the corpse of his beloved, and earth in which to bury her.  When he had reached the boulder overlooking the landslip, on which they had sat together, he lowered his burden, and, placing the dead girl on the stone, seated himself beside her for a time, gazing over toward Barey.  After that, he commenced his descent of the Mornstab Pass.    Chapter 20  BAREY  The day had already dawned, but it was not yet sunrise when Maskull awoke from his miserable sleep.  He sat up and yawned feebly.  The air was cool and sweet.  Far away down the landslip a bird was singing; the song consisted of only two notes, but it was so plaintive and heartbreaking that he scarcely knew how to endure it.  The eastern sky was a delicate green, crossed by a long, thin band of chocolate-coloured cloud near the horizon.  The atmosphere was blue- tinted, mysterious, and hazy.  Neither Sarclash nor Adage was visible.  The saddle of the Pass was five hundred feet above him; he had descended that distance overnight.  The landslip continued downward, like a huge flying staircase, to the upper slopes of Barey, which lay perhaps fifteen hundred feet beneath.  The surface of the Pass was rough, and the angle was excessively steep, though not precipitous. It was above a mile across.  On each side of it, east and west, the dark walls of the ridge descended sheer.  At the point where the pass sprang outward they were two thousand feet from top to bottom, but as the ridge went upward, on the one hand toward Adage, on the other toward Sarclash, they attained almost unbelievable heights.  Despite the great breadth and solidity of the pass, Maskull felt as though he were suspended in midair.  The patch of broken, rich, brown soil observable not far away marked Sullenbode's grave.  He had interred her by the light of the moon, with a long, flat stone for a spade.  A little lower down, the white steam of a hot spring was curling about in the twilight.  From where he sat he was unable to see the pool into which the spring ultimately flowed, but it was in that pool that he had last night washed first of all the dead girl's body, and then his own.  He got up, yawned again, stretched himself, and looked around him dully.  For a long time he eyed the grave.  The half-darkness changed by imperceptible degrees to full day; the sun was about to appear. The sky was nearly cloudless.  The whole wonderful extent of the mighty ridge behind him began to emerge from the morning mist... there was a part of Sarclash, and the ice-green crest of gigantic Adage itself, which he could only take in by throwing his head right back.  He gazed at everything in weary apathy, like a lost soul.  All his desires were gone forever; he wished to go nowhere, and to do nothing.  He thought he would go to Barey.  He went to the warm pool, to wash the sleep out of his eyes.  Sitting beside it, watching the bubbles, was Krag.  Maskull thought that he was dreaming.  The man was clothed in a skin shirt and breeches.  His face was stem, yellow, and ugly.  He eyed Maskull without smiling or getting up.  "Where in the devil's name have you come from, Krag?"  "The great point is, I am here."  "Where's Nightspore?"  "Not far away."  "It seems a hundred years since I saw you.  Why did you two leave me in such a damnable fashion?"  "You were strong enough to get through alone."  "So it turned out, but how were you to know? ....  Anyway, you've timed it well.  It seems I am to die today."  Krag scowled.  "You will die this morning."  "If I am to, I shall.  But where have you heard it from?"  "You are ripe for it.  You have run through the gamut.  What else is there to live for?"  "Nothing," said Maskull, uttering a short laugh.  "I am quite ready. I have failed in everything.  I only wondered how you knew....  So now you've come to rejoin me.  Where are we going?"  "Through Barey."  "And what about Nightspore?"  Krag jumped to his feet with clumsy agility.  "We won't wait for him. He'll be there as soon as we shall."  "Where?"  "At our destination....  Come!  The sun's rising."  As they started clambering down the pass side by side, Branchspell, huge and white, leaped fiercely into the sky.  All the delicacy of the dawn vanished, and another vulgar day began.  They passed some trees and plants, the leaves of which were all curled up, as if in sleep.  Maskull pointed them out to his companion.  "How is it the sunshine doesn't open them?"  "Branchspell is a second night to them.  Their day is Alppain."  "How long will it be before that sun rises?"  "Some time yet."  "Shall I live to see it, do you think?"  "Do you want to?"  "At one time I did, but now I'm indifferent."  "Keep in that humour, and you'll do well.  Once for all, there's nothing worth seeing on Tormance."  After a few minutes Maskull said, "Why did we come here, then?"  "To follow Surtur."  "True.  But where is he?"  "Closer at hand than you think, perhaps."  "Do you know that he is regarded as a god here, Krag?...  There is supernatural fire, too, which I have been led to believe is somehow connected with him....  Why do you keep up the mystery?  Who and what is Surtur?"  "Don't disturb yourself about that.  You will never know."  "Do you know?"  "I know," snarled Krag.  "The devil here is called Krag,"  went on Maskull, peering into his face.  "As long as pleasure is worshiped, Krag will always be the devil."  "Here we are, talking face to face, two men together....  What am I to believe of you?"  "Believe your senses.  The real devil is Crystalman."  They continued descending the landslip.  The sun's rays had grown insufferably hot.  In front of them, down below in the far distance, Maskull saw water and land intermingled.  It appeared that they were travelling toward a lake district.  "What have you and Nightspore been doing during the last four days, Krag?  What happened to the torpedo?"  "You're just about on the same mental level as a man who sees a brand-new palace, and asks what has become of the scaffolding."  "What palace have you been building, then?"  "We have not been idle," said Krag.  "While you have been murdering and lovemaking, we have had our work."  "And how have you been made acquainted with my actions?"  "Oh, you're an open book.  Now you've got a mortal heart wound on account of a woman you knew for six hours."  Maskull turned pale.  "Sneer away, Krag!  If you lived with a woman for six hundred years and saw her die, that would never touch your leather heart.  You haven't even the feelings of an insect."  "Behold the child defending its toys!" said Krag, grinning faintly.  Maskull stopped short.  "What do you want with me, and why did you bring me here?"  "It's no use stopping, even for the sake of theatrical effect," said Krag, pulling him into motion again.  "The distance has got to be covered, however often we pull up."  When he touched him, Maskull felt a terrible shooting pain through his heart.  "I can't go on regarding you as a man, Krag.  You're something more than a man--whether good or evil, I can't say."  Krag looked yellow and formidable.  He did not reply to Maskull's remark, but after a pause said, "So you've been trying to find Surtur on your own account, during the intervals between killing and fondling?"  "What was that drumming?" demanded Maskull.  "You needn't look so important.  We know you had your ear to the keyhole.  But you could join the assembly, the music was not playing for you, my friend."  Maskull smiled rather bitterly.  "At all events, I listen through no more keyholes.  I have finished with life.  I belong to nobody and nothing any more, from this time forward."  "Brave Words, brave words!  We shall see.  Perhaps Crystalman will make one more attempt on you.  There is still time for one more."  "Now I don't understand you."  "You think you are thoroughly disillusioned, don't you?  Well, that may prove to be the last and strongest illusion of all."  The conversation ceased.  They reached the foot of the landslip an hour later.  Branchspell was steadily mounting the cloudless sky.  It was approaching Sarclash, and it was an open question whether or not it would clear its peak.  The heat was sweltering.  The long, massive, saucer-shaped ridge behind them, with its terrific precipices, was glowing with bright morning colours.  Adage, towering up many thousands of feet higher still, guarded the end of it like a lonely Colossus.  In front of them, starting from where they stood, was a cool and enchanting wilderness of little lakes and forests. The water of the lakes was dark green; the forests were asleep, waiting for the rising of Alppain.  "Are we now in Barey?" asked Maskull.  "Yes--and there is one of the natives."  There was an ugly glint in his eye as he spoke the words, but Maskull did not see it.  A man was leaning in the shade against one of the first trees, apparently waiting for them to come up.  He was small, dark, and beardless, and was still in early manhood.  He was clothed in a dark blue, loosely flowing robe, and wore a broad-brimmed slouch hat.  His face, which was not disfigured by any special organs, was pale, earnest, and grave, yet somehow remarkably pleasing.  Before a word was spoken, he warmly grasped Maskull's hand, but even while he was in the act of doing so he threw a queer frown at Krag. The latter responded with a scowling grin.  When he opened his mouth to speak, his voice was a vibrating baritone, but it was at the same time strangely womanish in its modulations and variety of tone.  "I've been waiting for you here since sunrise," he said.  "Welcome to Barey, Maskull!  Let's hope you'll forget your sorrows here, you over-tested man."  Maskull stared at him, not without friendliness.  "What made you expect me, and how do you know my name?"  The stranger smiled, which made his face very handsome.  "I'm Gangnet.  I know most things."  "Haven't you a greeting for me too--Gangnet?" asked Krag, thrusting his forbidding features almost into the other's face.  "I know you, Krag.  There are few places where you are welcome."  "And I know you, Gangnet--you man-woman....  Well, we are here together, and you must make what you can of it.  We are going down to the Ocean."  The smile faded from Gangnet's face.  "I can't drive you away, Krag-- but I can make you the unwelcome third."  Krag threw back his head, and gave a loud, grating laugh.  "That bargain suits me all right.  As long as I have the substance, you may have the shadow, and much good may it do you."  "Now that it's all arranged so satisfactorily," said Maskull, with a hard smile, "permit me to say that I don't desire any society at all at present....  You take too much for granted, Krag.  You have played the false friend once already....  I presume I'm a free agent?"  "To be a free man, one must have a universe of one's own," said Krag, with a jeering look.  "What do you say, Gangnet--is this a free world?"  "Freedom from pain and ugliness should be every man's privilege," returned Gangnet tranquilly.  "Maskull is quite within his rights, and if you'll engage to leave him I'll do the same."  "Maskull can change face as often as he likes, but he won't get rid of me so easily.  Be easy on that point, Maskull."  "It doesn't matter," muttered Maskull.  "Let everyone join in the procession.  In a few hours I shall finally be free, anyhow, if what they say is true."  "I'll lead the way," said Gangnet.  "You don't know this country, of course, Maskull.  When we get to the flat lands some miles farther down, we shall be able to travel by water, but at present we must walk, I fear."  "Yes, you fear--you fear!" broke out Krag, in a highpitched, scraping voice.  "You eternal loller!"  Maskull kept looking from one to the other in amazement.  There seemed to be a determined hostility between the two, which indicated an intimate previous acquaintance.  They set off through a wood, keeping close to its border, so that for a mile or more they were within sight of the long, narrow lake that flowed beside it.  The trees were low and thin; their dolm-coloured leaves were all folded.  There was no underbrush--they walked on clean, brown earth, A distant waterfall sounded.  They were in shade, but the air was pleasantly warm.  There were no insects to irritate them.  The bright lake outside looked cool and poetic.  Gangnet pressed Maskull's arm affectionately.  "If the bringing of you from your world had fallen to me, Maskull, it is here I would have brought you, and not to the scarlet desert.  Then you would have escaped the dark spots, and Tormance would have appeared beautiful to you."  "And what then, Gangnet?  The dark spots would have existed all the same."  "You could have seen them afterward.  It makes all the difference whether one sees darkness through the light, or brightness through the shadows."  "A clear eye is the best.  Tormance is an ugly world, and I greatly prefer to know it as it really is."  "The devil made it ugly, not Crystalman.  These are Crystalman's thoughts, which you see around you.  He is nothing but Beauty and Pleasantness.  Even Krag won't have the effrontery to deny that."  "It's very nice here," said Krag, looking around him malignantly. "One only wants a cushion and half a dozen houris to complete it."  Maskull disengaged himself from Gangnet.  "Last night, when I was struggling through the mud in the ghastly moonlight--then I thought the world beautiful."  "Poor Sullenbode!" said Gangnet sighing.  "What!  You knew her?"  "I know her through you.  By mourning for a noble woman, you show your own nobility.  I think all women are noble."  "There may be millions of noble women, but there's only one Sullenbode."  "If Sullenbode can exist," said Gangnet, "the world cannot be a bad place."  "Change the subject....  The world's hard and cruel, and I am thankful to be leaving it."  "On one point, though, you both agree," said Krag, smiling evilly. "Pleasure is good, and the cessation of pleasure is bad."  Gangnet glanced at him coldly.  "We know your peculiar theories, Krag.  You are very fond of them, but they are unworkable.  The world could not go on being, without pleasure."  "So Gangnet thinks!" jeered Krag.  They came to the end of the wood, and found themselves overlooking a little cliff.  At the foot of it, about fifty feet below, a fresh series of lakes and forests commenced.  Barey appeared to be one big mountain slope, built by nature into terraces.  The lake along whose border they had been travelling was not banked at the end, but overflowed to the lower level in half a dozen beautiful, threadlike falls, white and throwing off spray.  The cliff was not perpendicular, and the men found it easy to negotiate.  At the  base they entered another wood.  Here it was much denser, and they had nothing but trees all around them.  A clear brook rippled through the heart of it; they followed its bank.  "It has occurred to me," said Maskull, addressing Gangnet, "that Alppain may be my death.  Is that so?"  "These trees don't fear Alppain, so why should you?  Alppain is a wonderful, life-bringing sun."  "The reason I ask is--I've seen its afterglow, and it produced such violent sensations that a very little more would have proved too much."  "Because the forces were evenly balanced.  When you see Alppain itself, it will reign supreme, and there will be no more struggling of wills inside you."  "And that, I may tell you beforehand, Maskull," said Krag, grinning, "is Crystalman's trump card."  "How do you mean?"  "You'll see.  You'll renounce the world so eagerly that you'll want to stay in the world merely to enjoy your sensations."  Gangnet smiled.  "Krag, you see, is hard to please.  You must neither enjoy, nor renounce.  What are you to do?"  Maskull turned toward Krag.  "It's very odd, but I don't understand your creed even yet.  Are you recommending suicide?"  Krag seemed to grow sallower and more repulsive every minute.  "What, because they have left off stroking you?" he exclaimed, laughing and showing his discoloured teeth.  "Whoever you are, and whatever you want," said Maskull, "you seem very certain of yourself."  "Yes, you would like me to blush and stammer like a booby, wouldn't you!  That would be an excellent way of destroying lies."  Gangnet glanced toward the foot of one of the trees.  He stooped and picked up two or three objects that resembled eggs.  "To eat?" asked Maskull, accepting the offered gift.  "Yes, eat them; you must be hungry.  I want none myself, and one mustn't insult Krag by offering him a pleasure--especially such a low pleasure."  Maskull knocked the ends off two of the eggs, and swallowed the liquid contents.  They tasted rather alcoholic.  Krag snatched the remaining, egg out of his hand and flung it against a tree trunk, where it broke and stuck, a splash of slime.  "I don't wait to be asked, Gangnet....  Say, is there a filthier sight than a smashed pleasure?"  Gangnet did not reply, but took Maskull's arm.  After they had alternately walked through forests and descended cliffs and slopes for upward of two hours, the landscape altered.  A steep mountainside commenced and continued for at least a couple of miles, during which space the land must have dropped nearly four thousand feet, at a practically uniform gradient.  Maskull had seen nothing like this immense slide of country anywhere.  The hill slope carried an enormous forest on its back.  This forest, however, was different from those they had hitherto passed through.  The leaves of the trees were curled in sleep, but the boughs were so close and numerous that, but for the fact that they were translucent, the rays of the sun would have been completely intercepted.  As it was, the whole forest was flooded with light, and this light, being tinged with the colour of the branches, was a soft and lovely rose.  So gay, feminine, and dawnlike was the illumination, that Maskull's spirits immediately started to rise, although he did not wish it.  He checked himself, sighed, and grew pensive.  "What a place for languishing eyes and necks of ivory, Maskull!" rasped Krag mockingly.  "Why isn't Sullenbode here?"  Maskull gripped him roughly and flung him against the nearest tree. Krag recovered himself, and burst into a roaring laugh, seeming not a whit discomposed.  "Still what I said--was it true or untrue?"  Maskull gazed at him sternly.  "You seem to regard yourself as a necessary evil.  I'm under no obligation to go on with you any farther.  I think we had better part."  Krag turned to Gangnet with an air of grotesque mock earnestness.  "What do you say--do we part when Maskull pleases, or when I please?"  "Keep your temper, Maskull," said Gangnet, showing Krag his back.  "I know the man better than you do.  Now that he has fastened onto you there's only one way of making him lose his hold, by ignoring him. Despise him--say nothing to him, don't answer his questions.  If you refuse to recognise his existence, he is as good as not here."  "I'm beginning to be tired of it all," said Maskull.  "It seems as if I shall add one more to my murders, before I have finished."  "I smell murder in the air," exclaimed Krag, pretending to sniff. "But whose?"  "Do as I say, Maskull.  To bandy words with him is to throw oil on fire."  "I'll say no more to anyone....  When do we get out of this accursed forest?"  "It's some way yet, but when we're once out we can take to the water, and you will be able to rest, and think."  "And brood comfortably over your sufferings," added Krag.  None of the three men said anything more until they emerged into the open day.  The slope of the forest was so steep that they were forced to run, rather than walk, and this would have prevented any conversation, even if they had otherwise felt inclined toward it.  In less than half an hour they were through.  A flat, open landscape lay stretched in front of them as far as they could see.  Three parts of this country consisted of smooth water.  It was a succession of large, low-shored lakes, divided by narrow strips of tree-covered land.  The lake immediately before them had its small end to the forest.  It was there about a third of a mile wide.  The water at the sides and end was shallow, and choked with dolm-colored rushes; but in the middle, beginning a few yards from the shore, there was a perceptible current away from them.  In view of this current, it was difficult to decide whether it was a lake or a river. Some little floating islands were in the shallows.  "Is it here that we take to the water?" inquired Maskull.  "Yes, here," answered Gangnet.  "But how?"  "One of those islands will serve.  It only needs to move it into the stream."  Maskull frowned.  "Where will it carry us to?"  "Come, get on, get on!" said Krag, laughing uncouthly.  "The morning's wearing away, and you have to die before noon.  We are going to the Ocean."  "If you are omniscient, Krag, what is my death to be?"  "Gangnet will murder you."  "You lie!" said Gangnet.  "I wish Maskull nothing but good."  "At all events, he will be the cause of your death.  But what does it matter?  The great point is you are quitting this futile world.... Well, Gangnet, I see you're as slack as ever.  I suppose I must do the work."  He jumped into the lake and began to run through the shallow water, splashing it about.  When he came to the nearest island, the water was up to his thighs.  The island was lozenge-shaped, and about fifteen feet from end to end.  It was composed of a sort of light brown peat; there was no form of living vegetation on its surface. Krag went behind it, and started shoving it toward the current, apparently without having unduly to exert himself.  When it was within the influence of the stream the others waded out to him, and all three climbed on.  The voyage began.  The current was not travelling at more than two miles an hour.  The sun glared down on their heads mercilessly, and there was no shade or prospect of shade.  Maskull sat down near the edge, and periodically splashed water over his head.  Gangnet sat on his haunches next to him.  Krag paced up and down with short, quick steps, like an animal in a cage.  The lake widened out more and more, and the width of the stream increased in proportion, until they seemed to themselves to be floating on the bosom of some broad, flowing estuary.  Krag suddenly bent over and snatched off Gangnet's hat, crushing it together in his hairy fist and throwing it far out into the stream.  "Why should you disguise yourself like a woman?" he asked with a harsh guffaw--"Show Maskull your face.  Perhaps he has seen it somewhere."  Gangnet did remind Maskull of someone, but he could not say of whom. His dark hair curled down to his neck, his brow was wide, lofty, and noble, and there was an air of serious sweetness about the whole man that was strangely appealing to the feelings.  "Let Maskull judge," he said with proud composure, "whether I have anything to be ashamed of."  "There can be nothing but magnificent thoughts in that head," muttered Maskull, staring hard at him.  "A capital valuation.  Gangnet is the king of poets.  But what happens when poets try to carry through practical enterprises?"  "What enterprises?" asked Maskull, in astonishment.  "What have you got on hand, Gangnet?  Tell Maskull."  "There are two forms of practical activity," replied Gangnet calmly. "One may either build up, or destroy."  "No, there's a third species.  One may steal--and not even know one is stealing.  One may take the purse and leave the money."  Maskull raised his eyebrows.  "Where have you two met before?"  "I'm paying Gangnet a visit today, Maskull but once upon a time Gangnet paid me a visit."  "Where?"  "In my home--whatever that is.  Gangnet is a common thief."  "You are speaking in riddles, and I don't understand you.  I don't know either of you, but it's clear that if Gangnet is a poet, you're a buffoon.  Must you go on talking?  I want to be quiet."  Krag laughed, but said no more.  Presently he lay down at full length, with his face to the sun, and in a few minutes was fast asleep, and snoring disagreeably.  Maskull kept glancing over at his yellow, repulsive face with strong disfavour.  Two hours passed.  The land on either side was more than a mile distant.  In front of them there was no land at all.  Behind them, the Lichstorm Mountains were blotted out from view by a haze that had gathered together.  The sky ahead, just above the horizon, began to be of a strange colour.  It was an intense jale-blue.  The whole northern atmosphere was stained with ulfire.  Maskull's mind grew disturbed.  "Alppain is rising, Gangnet."  Gangnet smiled wistfully.  "It begins to trouble you?"  "It is so solemn--tragical, almost--yet it recalls me to Earth. Life was no longer important--but this is important."  "Daylight is night to this other daylight.  Within half an hour you will be like a man who has stepped from a dark forest into the open day.  Then you will ask yourself how you could have been blind."  The two men went on watching the blue sunrise.  The entire sky in the north, halfway up to the zenith, was streaked with extraordinary colours, among which jale and dolm predominated.  Just as the principal character of an ordinary dawn is mystery, the outstanding character of this dawn was wildness.  It did not baffle the understanding, but the heart.  Maskull felt no inarticulate craving to seize and perpetuate the sunrise, and make it his own.  Instead of that, it agitated and tormented him, like the opening bars of a supernatural symphony.  When he looked back to the south, Branchspell's day had lost its glare, and he could gaze at the immense white sun without flinching. He instinctively turned to the north again, as one turns from darkness to light.  "If those were Crystalman's thoughts that you showed me before, Gangnet, these must be his feelings.  I mean it literally.  What I am feeling now, he must have felt before me."  "He is all feeling, Maskull--don't you understand that?"  Maskull was feeding greedily on the spectacle before him; he did not reply.  His face was set like a rock, but his eyes were dim with the beginning of tears.  The sky blazed deeper and deeper; it was obvious that Alppain was about to lift itself above the sea.  The island had by this time floated past the mouth of the estuary.  On three sides they were surrounded by water.  The haze crept up behind them and shut out all sight of land.  Krag was still sleeping--an ugly, wrinkled monstrosity.  Maskull looked over the side at the flowing water.  It had lost its dark green colour, and was now of a perfect crystal transparency.  "Are we already on the Ocean, Gangnet?"  "Yes."  "Then nothing remains except my death."  "Don't think of death, but life."  "It's growing brighter--at the same time, more sombre, Krag seems to be fading away...."  "There is Alppain!" said Gangnet, touching his arm.  The deep, glowing disk of the blue sun peeped above the sea.  Maskull was struck to silence.  He was hardly so much looking, as feeling. His emotions were unutterable.  His soul seemed too strong for his body.  The great blue orb rose rapidly out of the water, like an awful eye watching him.... it shot above the sea with a bound, and Alppain's day commenced.  "What do you feel?"  Gangnet still held his arm.  "I have set myself against the Infinite," muttered Maskull.  Suddenly his chaos of passions sprang together, and a wonderful idea swept through his whole being, accompanied by the intensest joy.  "Why, Gangnet--I am nothing."  "No, you are nothing."  The mist closed in all around them.  Nothing was visible except the two suns, and a few feet of sea.  The shadows of the three men cast by Alppain were not black, but were composed of white daylight.  "Then nothing can hurt me," said Maskull with a peculiar smile.  Gangnet smiled too.  "How could it?"  "I have lost my will; I feel as if some foul tumour had been scraped away, leaving me clean and free."  "Do you now understand life, Maskull?"  Gangnet's face was transfigured with an extraordinary spiritual beauty; he looked as if he had descended from heaven.  "I understand nothing, except that I have no self any more.  But this is life."  "Is Gangnet expatiating on his famous blue sun?" said a jeering voice above them.  Looking up, they saw that Krag had got to his feet.  They both rose.  At the same moment the gathering mist began to obscure Alppain's disk, changing it from blue to a vivid jale.  "What do you want with us, Krag?" asked Maskull with simple composure.  Krag looked at him strangely for a few seconds.  The water lapped around them.  "Don't you comprehend, Maskull, that your death has arrived?"  Maskull made no response.  Krag rested an arm lightly on his shoulder, and suddenly he felt sick and faint.  He sank to the ground, near the edge of the island raft.  His heart was thumping heavily and queerly; its beating reminded him of the drum taps.  He gazed languidly at the rippling water, and it seemed to him as if he could see right through it... away, away down... to a strange fire....  The water disappeared.  The two suns were extinguished.  The island was transformed into a cloud, and Maskull--alone on it--was floating through the atmosphere....  Down below, it was all fire-- the fire of Muspel.  The light mounted higher and higher, until it filled the whole world....  He floated toward an immense perpendicular cliff of black rock, without top or bottom.  Halfway up it Krag, suspended in midair, was dealing terrific blows at a blood-red spot with a huge hammer.  The rhythmical, clanging sounds were hideous.  Presently Maskull made out that these sounds were the familiar drum beats.  "What are you doing, Krag?" he asked.  Krag suspended his work, and turned around.  "Beating on Your heart, Maskull," was his grinning response.  The cliff and Krag vanished.  Maskull saw Gangnet struggling in the air--but it was not Gangnet--it was Crystalman.  He seemed to be trying to escape from the Muspel-fire, which kept surrounding and licking him, whichever way he turned.  He was screaming....  The fire caught him.  He shrieked horribly.  Maskull caught one glimpse of a vulgar, slobbering face--and then that too disappeared.  He opened his eyes.  The floating island was still faintly illuminated by Alppain.  Krag was standing by his side, but Gangnet was no longer there.  "What is this Ocean called?" asked Maskull, bringing out the words with difficulty.  "Surtur's Ocean."  Maskull nodded, and kept quiet for some time.  He rested his face on his arm.  "Where's Nightspore?" he asked suddenly.  Krag bent over him with a grave expression.  "You are Nightspore."  The dying man closed his eyes, and smiled.  Opening them again, a few moments later, with an effort, he murmured, "Who are you?"  Krag maintained a gloomy silence.  Shortly afterward a frightful pang passed through Maskull's heart, and he died immediately.  Krag turned his head around.  "The night is really past at last, Nightspore....  The day is here."  Nightspore gazed long and earnestly at Maskull's body.  "Why was all this necessary?"  "Ask Crystalman," replied Krag sternly.  "His world is no joke.  He has a strong clutch--but I have a stronger... Maskull was his, but Nightspore is mine."    Chapter 21  MUSPEL  The fog thickened so that the two suns wholly disappeared, and all grew as black as night.  Nightspore could no longer see his companion.  The water lapped gently against the side of the island raft.  "You say the night is past," said Nightspore.  "But the night is still here.  Am I dead, or alive?"  "You are still in Crystalman's world, but you belong to it no more. We are approaching Muspel."  Nightspore felt a strong, silent throbbing of the air--a rhythmical pulsation, in four-four time.  "There is the drumming," he exclaimed.  "Do you understand it, or have you forgotten?"  "I half understand it, but I'm all confused."  "It's evident Crystalman has dug his claws into you pretty deeply," said Krag.  "The sound comes from Muspel, but the rhythm is caused by its travelling through Crystalman's atmosphere.  His nature is rhythm as he loves to call it--or dull, deadly repetition, as I name it."  "I remember," said Nightspore, biting his nails in the dark.  The throbbing became audible; it now sounded like a distant drum.  A small patch of strange light in the far distance, straight ahead of them, began faintly to illuminate the floating island and the glassy sea around it.  "Do all men escape from that ghastly world, or only I, and a few like me?" asked Nightspore.  "If all escaped, I shouldn't sweat, my friend... There's hard work, and anguish, and the risk of total death, waiting for us yonder."  Nightspore's heart sank.  "Have I not yet finished, then?"  "If you wish it.  You have got through.  But will you wish it?"  The drumming grew loud and painful.  The light resolved itself into a tiny oblong of mysterious brightness in a huge wall of night.  Krag's grim and rocklike features were revealed.  "I can't face rebirth," said Nightspore.  "The horror of death is nothing to it."  "You will choose."  "I can do nothing.  Crystalman is too powerful.  I barely escaped with-- my own soul."  "You are still stupid with Earth fumes, and see nothing straight," said Krag.  Nightspore made no reply, but seemed to be trying to recall something.  The water around them was so still, colourless, and transparent, that they scarcely seemed to be borne up by liquid matter at all.  Maskull's corpse had disappeared.  The drumming was now like the clanging of iron.  The oblong patch of light grew much bigger; it burned, fierce and wild.  The darkness above, below, and on either side of it, began to shape itself into the semblance of a huge, black wall, without bounds.  "Is that really a wall we are coming to?"  "You will soon find out.  What you see is Muspel, and that light is the gate you have to enter."  Nightspore's heart beat wildly.  "Shall I remember?" he muttered.  "Yes, you'll remember."  "Accompany me, Krag, or I shall be lost."  "There is nothing for me to do in there.  I shall wait outside for you."  "You are returning to the struggle?" demanded Nightspore, gnawing his fingertips.  "Yes."  "I dare not."  The thunderous clangor of the rhythmical beats struck on his head like actual blows.  The light glared so vividly that he was no longer able to look at it.  It had the startling irregularity of continuous lightning, but it possessed this further peculiarity--that it seemed somehow to give out not actual light, but emotion, seen as light. They continued to approach the wall of darkness, straight toward the door.  The glasslike water flowed right against it, its surface reaching up almost to the threshold.  They could not speak any more; the noise was too deafening.  In a few minutes they were before the gateway.  Nightspore turned his back and hid his eyes in his two hands, but even then he was blinded by the light.  So passionate were his feelings that his body seemed to enlarge itself.  At every frightful beat of sound, he quivered violently.  The entrance was doorless.  Krag jumped onto the rocky platform and pulled Nightspore after him.  Once through the gateway, the light vanished.  The rhythmical sound-- blows totally ceased.  Nightspore dropped his hands....  All was dark and quiet as an opened tomb.  But the air was filled with grim, burning passion, which was to light and sound what light itself is to opaque colour.  Nightspore pressed his hand to his heart.  "I don't know if I can endure it," he said, looking toward Krag.  He felt his person far more vividly and distinctly than if he had been able to see him.  "Go in, and lose no time, Nightspore....  Time here is more precious than on earth.  We can't squander the minutes.  There are terrible and tragic affairs to attend to, which won't wait for us... Go in at once.  Stop for nothing."  "Where shall I go to?" muttered Nightspore.  "I have forgotten everything."  "Enter, enter!  There is only one way.  You can't mistake it."  "Why do you bid me go in, if I am to come out again?"  "To have your wounds healed."  Almost before the words had left his mouth, Krag sprang back on to the island raft.  Nightspore involuntarily started after him, but at once recovered himself and remained standing where he was.  Krag was completely invisible; everything outside was black night.  The moment he had gone, a feeling shot up in Nightspore's heart like a thousand trumpets.  Straight in front of him, almost at his feet, was the lower end of a steep, narrow, circular flight of stone steps.  There was no other way forward.  He put his foot on the bottom stair, at the same time peering aloft. He saw nothing, yet as he proceeded upward every inch of the way was perceptible to his inner feelings.  The staircase was cold, dismal, and deserted, but it seemed to him, in his exaltation of soul, like a ladder to heaven.  After he had mounted a dozen steps or so, he paused to take breath. Each step was increasingly difficult to ascend; he felt as though he were carrying a heavy man on his shoulders.  It struck a familiar chord in his mind.  He went on and, ten stairs higher up, came to a window set in a high embrasure.  On to this he clambered, and looked through.  The window was of a sort of glass, but he could see nothing.  Coming to him, however, from the world outside, a disturbance of the atmosphere struck his senses, causing his blood to run cold.  At one moment it resembled a low, mocking, vulgar laugh, travelling from the ends of the earth; at the next it was like a rhythmical vibration of the air--the silent, continuous throbbing of some mighty engine.  The two sensations were identical, yet different.  They seemed to be related in the same manner as soul and body.  After feeling them for a long time, Nightspore got down from the embrasure, and continued his ascent, having meanwhile grown very serious.  The climbing became still more laborious, and he was forced to stop at every third or fourth step, to rest his muscles and regain breath. When he had mounted another twenty stairs in this way, he came to a second window.  Again he saw nothing.  The laughing disturbance of the air, too, had ceased; but the atmospheric throb was now twice as distinct as before, and its rhythm had become double.  There were two separate pulses; one was in the time of a march, the other in the time of a waltz.  The first was bitter and petrifying to feel, but the second was gay, enervating, and horrible.  Nightspore spent little time at that window, for he felt that he was on the eve of a great discovery, and that something far more important awaited him higher up.  He proceeded aloft.  The ascent grew more and more exhausting, so much so that he had frequently to sit down, utterly crushed by his own dead weight.  Still, he got to the third window.  He climbed into the embrasure.  His feelings translated themselves into vision, and he saw a sight that caused him to turn pale.  A gigantic, self-luminous sphere was hanging in the sky, occupying nearly the whole of it.  This sphere was composed entirely of two kinds of active beings.  There were a myriad of tiny green corpuscles, varying in size from the very small to the almost indiscernible.  They were not green, but he somehow saw them so. They were all striving in one direction--toward himself, toward Muspel, but were too feeble and miniature to make any headway.  Their action produced the marching rhythm he had previously felt, but this rhythm was not intrinsic in the corpuscles themselves, but was a consequence of the obstruction they met with.  And, surrounding these atoms of life and light, were far larger whirls of white light that gyrated hither and thither, carrying the green corpuscles with them wherever they desired.  Their whirling motion was accompanied by the waltzing rhythm.  It seemed to Nightspore that the green atoms were not only being danced about against their will but were suffering excruciating shame and degradation in consequence.  The larger ones were steadier than the extremely small, a few were even almost stationary, and one was advancing in the direction it wished to go.  He turned his back to the window, buried his face in his hands, and searched in the dim recesses of his memory for an explanation of what he had just seen.  Nothing came straight, but horror and wrath began to take possession of him.  On his way upward to the next window, invisible fingers seemed to him to be squeezing his heart and twisting it about here and there; but he never dreamed of turning back.  His mood was so grim that he did not once permit himself to pause.  Such was his physical distress by the time that he had clambered into the recess, that for several minutes he could see nothing at all--the world seemed to be spinning round him rapidly.  When at last he looked, he saw the same sphere as before, but now all was changed on it.  It was a world of rocks, minerals, water, plants, animals, and men.  He saw the whole world at one view, yet everything was so magnified that he could distinguish the smallest details of life.  In the interior of every individual, of every aggregate of individuals, of every chemical atom, he clearly perceived the presence of the green corpuscles.  But, according to the degree of dignity of the life form, they were fragmentary or comparatively large.  In the crystal, for example, the green, imprisoned life was so minute as to be scarcely visible; in some men it was hardly bigger; but in other men and women it was twenty or a hundred times greater.  But, great or small, it played an important part in every individual.  It appeared as if the whirls of white light, which were the individuals, and plainly showed themselves beneath the enveloping bodies, were delighted with existence and wished only to enjoy it, but the green corpuscles were in a condition of eternal discontent, yet, blind and not knowing which way to turn for liberation, kept changing form, as though breaking a new path, by way of experiment. Whenever the old grotesque became metamorphosed into the new grotesque, it was in every case the direct work of the green atoms, trying to escape toward Muspel, but encountering immediate opposition.  These subdivided sparks of living, fiery spirit were hopelessly imprisoned in a ghastly mush of soft pleasure.  They were being effeminated and corrupted--that is to say, absorbed in the foul, sickly enveloping forms.  Nightspore felt a sickening shame in his soul as he looked on at that spectacle.  His exaltation had long since vanished.  He bit his nails, and understood why Krag was waiting for him below.  He mounted slowly to the fifth window.  The pressure of air against him was as strong as a full gale, divested of violence and irregularity, so that he was not for an instant suffered to relax his efforts.  Nevertheless, not a breath stirred.  Looking through the window, he was startled by a new sight.  The sphere was still there, but between it and the Muspel-world in which he was standing he perceived a dim, vast shadow, without any distinguishable shape, but somehow throwing out a scent of disgusting sweetness.  Nightspore knew that it was Crystalman.  A flood of fierce light--but it was not light, but passion--was streaming all the time from Muspel to the Shadow, and through it.  When, however, it emerged on the other side, which was the sphere, the light was altered in character.  It became split, as by a prism, into the two forms of life which he had previously seen--the green corpuscles and the whirls.  What had been fiery spirit but a moment ago was now a disgusting mass of crawling, wriggling individuals, each whirl of pleasure-seeking will having, as nucleus, a fragmentary spark of living green fire.  Nightspore recollected the back rays of Starkness, and it flashed across him with the certainty of truth that the green sparks were the back rays, and the whirls the forward rays, of Muspel.  The former were trying desperately to return to their place of origin, but were overpowered by the brute force of the latter, which wished only to remain where they were.  The individual whirls were jostling and fighting with, and even devouring, each other.  This created pain, but, whatever pain they felt, it was always pleasure that they sought.  Sometimes the green sparks were strong enough for a moment to move a little way in the direction of Muspel; the whirls would then accept the movement, not only without demur, but with pride and pleasure, as if it were their own handiwork-- but they never saw beyond the Shadow, they thought that they were travelling toward it.  The instant the direct movement wearied them, as contrary to their whirling nature, they fell again to killing, dancing, and loving.  Nightspore had a foreknowledge that the sixth window would prove to be the last.  Nothing would have kept him from ascending to it, for he guessed that the nature of Crystalman himself would there become manifest.  Every step upward was like a bloody life-and-death struggle.  The stairs nailed him to the ground; the air pressure caused blood to gush from his nose and ears; his head clanged like an iron bell.  When he had fought his way up a dozen steps, he found himself suddenly at the top; the staircase terminated in a small, bare chamber of cold stone, possessing a single window.  On the other side of the apartment another short flight of stairs mounted through a trap, apparently to the roof of the building.  Before ascending these stairs, Nightspore hastened to the window and stared out.  The shadow form of Crystalman had drawn much closer to him, and filled the whole sky, but it was not a shadow of darkness, but a bright shadow.  It had neither shape, nor colour, yet it in some way suggested the delicate tints of early morning.  It was so nebulous that the sphere could be clearly distinguished through it; in extension, however, it was thick.  The sweet smell emanating from it was strong, loathsome, and terrible; it seemed to spring from a sort of loose, mocking slime inexpressibly vulgar and ignorant.  The spirit stream from Muspel flashed with complexity and variety. It was not below individuality, but above it.  It was not the One, or the Many, but something else far beyond either.  It approached Crystalman, and entered his body--if that bright mist could be called a body.  It passed right through him, and the passage caused him the most exquisite pleasure.  The Muspel-stream was Crystalman's food.  The stream emerged from the other side on to the sphere, in a double condition.  Part of it reappeared intrinsically unaltered, but shivered into a million fragments.  These were the green corpuscles. In passing through Crystalman they had escaped absorption by reason of their extreme minuteness.  The other part of the stream had not escaped.  Its fire had been abstracted, its cement was withdrawn, and, after being fouled and softened by the horrible sweetness of the host, it broke into individuals, which were the whirls of living will.  Nightspore shuddered.  He comprehended at last how the whole world of will was doomed to eternal anguish in order that one Being might feel joy.  Presently he set foot on the final flight leading to the roof; for he remembered vaguely that now only that remained.  Halfway up, he fainted--but when he recovered consciousness he persisted as though nothing had happened to him.  As soon as his head was above the trap, breathing the free air, he had the same physical sensation as a man stepping out of water.  He pulled his body up, and stood expectantly on the stone-floored roof, looking round for his first glimpse of Muspel.  There was nothing.  He was standing upon the top of a tower, measuring not above fifteen feet each way.  Darkness was all around him.  He sat down on the stone parapet, with a sinking heart; a heavy foreboding possessed him.  Suddenly, without seeing or hearing anything, he had the distinct impression that the darkness around him, on all four sides, was grinning....  As soon as that happened, he understood that he was wholly surrounded by Crystalman's world, and that Muspel consisted of himself and the stone tower on which he was sitting..  Fire flashed in his heart....  Millions upon millions of grotesque, vulgar, ridiculous, sweetened individuals--once Spirit--were calling out from their degradation and agony for salvation from Muspel....  To answer that cry there was only himself... and Krag waiting below... and Surtur--But where was Surtur?  The truth forced itself on him in all its cold, brutal reality. Muspel was no all-powerful Universe, tolerating from pure indifference the existence side by side with it of another false world, which had no right to be.  Muspel was fighting for its life-- against all that is most shameful and frightful--against sin masquerading as eternal beauty, against baseness masquerading as Nature, against the Devil masquerading as God....  Now he understood everything.  The moral combat was no mock one, no Valhalla, where warriors are cut to pieces by day and feast by night; but a grim death struggle in which what is worse than death--namely, spiritual death--inevitably awaited the vanquished of Muspel....  By what means could he hold back from this horrible war!  During those moments of anguish, all thoughts of Self--the corruption of his life on Earth--were scorched out of Nightspore's soul, perhaps not for the first time.  After sitting a long time, he prepared to descend.  Without warning, a strange, wailing cry swept over the face of the world.  Starting in awful mystery, it ended with such a note of low and sordid mockery that he could not doubt for a moment whence it originated.  It was the voice of Crystalman.  Krag was waiting for him on the island raft.  He threw a stern glance at Nightspore.  "Have you seen everything?"  "The struggle is hopeless," muttered Nightspore.  "Did I not say I am the stronger?"  "You may be the stronger, but he is the mightier."  "I am the stronger and the mightier.  Crystalman's Empire is but a shadow on the face of Muspel.  But nothing will be done without the bloodiest blows....  What do you mean to do?"  Nightspore looked at him strangely.  "Are you not Surtur, Krag?"  "Yes."  "Yes," said Nightspore in a slow voice, without surprise.  "But what is your name on Earth?"  "It is pain."  "That, too, I must have known."  He was silent for a few minutes; then he stepped quietly onto the raft.  Krag pushed off, and they proceeded into the darkness.
